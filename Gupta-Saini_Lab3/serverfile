Fyodor Pavlovitch KaramazovyooyooyooAlexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor PavlovitchyooKaramazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, andyoostill remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, whichyoohappened thirteen years ago, and '
12
b'l describe in its properyooplace. For the present I will only say that this \xe2\x80\x9clandowner\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for so weyooused to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his ownyooestate\xe2\x80\x94was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, ayootype abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one ofyoothose senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after theiryooworldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,yoofor instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest;yoohe ran to dine at other men\xe2\x80\x99s tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yetyooat his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hardyoocash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless,yoofantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was notyoostupidity\xe2\x80\x94the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd andyoointelligent enough\xe2\x80\x94but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form ofyooit.yooyooHe w'
12
b'wice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his firstyoowife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor Pavlovitch\xe2\x80\x99s firstyoowife, Adela\xc3\xafda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished nobleyoofamily, also landowners in our district, the Mi\xc3\xbcsovs. How it came to passyoothat an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of thoseyoovigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimesyooalso to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, punyyooweakling, as we all called him, I won\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to explain. I knew a youngyoolady of the last \xe2\x80\x9cromantic\xe2\x80\x9d generation who after some years of anyooenigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily haveyoomarried at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, andyooended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapidyooriver from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely toyoosatisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s '
12
b'eed, ifyoothis precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been lessyoopicturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, mostyoolikely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, andyooprobably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two oryoothree generations. Adela\xc3\xafda Ivanovna Mi\xc3\xbcsov\xe2\x80\x99s action was similarly, noyoodoubt, an echo of other people\xe2\x80\x99s ideas, and was due to the irritationyoocaused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show heryoofeminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism ofyooher family. And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, foryooa brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasiticyooposition, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressiveyooepoch, though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.yooWhat gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement,yooand this greatly captivated Adela\xc3\xafda Ivanovna\xe2\x80\x99s fa'
12
b'Pavlovitch\xe2\x80\x99syooposition at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise, foryoohe was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another. Toyooattach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluringyooprospect. As for mutual love it did not exist apparently, either in theyoobride or in him, in spite of Adela\xc3\xafda Ivanovna\xe2\x80\x99s beauty. This was,yooperhaps, a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, whoyoowas always of a voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat onyoothe slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman whoyoomade no particular appeal to his senses.yooyooImmediately after the elopement Adela\xc3\xafda Ivanovna discerned in a flashyoothat she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriageyooaccordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity.yooAlthough the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned theyoorunaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to lead a mo'
12
b'rly life, and there were everlasting scenes between them. It wasyoosaid that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignityyoothan Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money upyooto twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that thoseyoothousands were lost to her for ever. The little village and the ratheryoofine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his utmost for ayoolong time to transfer to his name, by means of some deed of conveyance. Heyoowould probably have succeeded, merely from her moral fatigue and desire toyooget rid of him, and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by hisyoopersistent and shameless importunity. But, fortunately, Adela\xc3\xafdayooIvanovna\xe2\x80\x99s family intervened and circumvented his greediness. It is knownyoofor a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife,yoobut rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but wasyoobeaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark'
12
b'atientyoowoman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally, she left theyoohouse and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinityyoostudent, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old, in her husband\xe2\x80\x99syoohands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into theyoohouse, and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness. In the intervals heyooused to drive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and allyooof Adela\xc3\xafda Ivanovna\xe2\x80\x99s having left him, going into details too disgracefulyoofor a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed toyoogratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous partyooof the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cOne would think that you\xe2\x80\x99d got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you seemyooso pleased in spite of your sorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d scoffers said to him. Many even addedyoothat he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon, andyoothat it was simply '
12
b'unnier that he pretended to be unaware ofyoohis ludicrous position. But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. Atyoolast he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The pooryoowoman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinityyoostudent, and where she had thrown herself into a life of completeyooemancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, makingyoopreparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himselfyoohave said. He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to doyooso he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by anotheryoobout of reckless drinking. And just at that time his wife\xe2\x80\x99s familyyooreceived the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenlyyooin a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version hadyooit, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife\xe2\x80\x99syoodeath, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shoutingyo'
12
b'aising his hands to Heaven: \xe2\x80\x9cLord, now lettest Thou Thy servantyoodepart in peace,\xe2\x80\x9d but others say he wept without restraint like a littleyoochild, so much so that people were sorry for him, in spite of theyoorepulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions were true,yoothat he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her whoyooreleased him. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much moreyoona\xc3\xafve and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.yooyooyooyooChapter II. He Gets Rid Of His Eldest SonyooyooyooYou can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he wouldyoobring up his children. His behavior as a father was exactly what might beyooexpected. He completely abandoned the child of his marriage with Adela\xc3\xafdayooIvanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial grievances, butyoosimply because he forgot him. While he was wearying every one with hisyootears and complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauche'
12
b'hful servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mityayoointo his care. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t looked after him there would have been no oneyooeven to change the baby\xe2\x80\x99s little shirt.yooyooIt happened moreover that the child\xe2\x80\x99s relations on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s sideyooforgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living, his widow,yooMitya\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill, while hisyoodaughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a whole year inyooold Grigory\xe2\x80\x99s charge and lived with him in the servant\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. But ifyoohis father had remembered him (he could not, indeed, have been altogetheryoounaware of his existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, asyoothe child would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But ayoocousin of Mitya\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\xc3\xbcsov, happened to returnyoofrom Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at thatyootime quite a young man, and distinguished among the Mi\xc3\xbcsov'
12
b'fyooenlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been in the capitalsyooand abroad. Towards the end of his life he became a Liberal of the typeyoocommon in the forties and fifties. In the course of his career he had comeyoointo contact with many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both inyooRussia and abroad. He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and inyoohis declining years was very fond of describing the three days of theyooParis Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had almostyootaken part in the fighting on the barricades. This was one of the mostyoograteful recollections of his youth. He had an independent property ofyooabout a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. His splendid estateyoolay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of ouryoofamous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endlessyoolawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate, concerning the rightsyooof fishing in the river or wood-cutting in the forest,'
12
b'nowyooexactly which. He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man ofyooculture to open an attack upon the \xe2\x80\x9cclericals.\xe2\x80\x9d Hearing all about Adela\xc3\xafdayooIvanovna, whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one timeyoobeen interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened, inyoospite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch.yooHe made the latter\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance for the first time, and told himyoodirectly that he wished to undertake the child\xe2\x80\x99s education. He used longyooafterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he began to speakyooof Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did notyoounderstand what child he was talking about, and even as though he wasyoosurprised to hear that he had a little son in the house. The story mayyoohave been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing anyoounexpected part, sometimes withou'
12
b' for doing so, and even toyoohis own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case. Thisyoohabit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, someyooof them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitchyoocarried the business through vigorously, and was appointed, with FyodoryooPavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a houseyooand land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into thisyoocousin\xe2\x80\x99s keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and afteryoosecuring the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once toyooParis, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady living inyooMoscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in Paris he, too,yooforgot the child, especially when the Revolution of February broke out,yoomaking an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of hisyoolife. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya passed into the care of one of heryoomarried daughter'
12
b' he changed his home a fourth time later on. Iyoowon\xe2\x80\x99t enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of FyodoryooPavlovitch\xe2\x80\x99s firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essentialyoofacts about him, without which I could not begin my story.yooyooIn the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was theyooonly one of Fyodor Pavlovitch\xe2\x80\x99s three sons who grew up in the belief thatyoohe had property, and that he would be independent on coming of age. Heyoospent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his studies at theyoogymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, wasyoopromoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotionyooagain, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money. He did not beginyooto receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, andyoountil then got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch,yoofor the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood'
12
b'e to settle with him about his property. He seems not to have likedyoohis father. He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away,yoohaving only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into anyooagreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and valueyooof which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to getyooa statement from his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first timeyoothen (this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggeratedyooidea of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this,yooas it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the young manyoowas frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, andyoothat if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied, althoughyooonly, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to takeyooadvantage of this fact, sending him from time to time small doles,yooinstallments. In the end, when four years later'
12
b'ing patience,yoocame a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with hisyoofather, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it wasyoodifficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value ofyoohis property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps evenyooin debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of his ownyoodesire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right to expectyooanything more, and so on, and so on. The young man was overwhelmed,yoosuspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself. And, indeed,yoothis circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms theyoosubject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it.yooBut before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch\xe2\x80\x99syooother two sons, and of their origin.yooyooyooyooChapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second FamilyyooyooyooVery shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his '
12
b'yooPavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight years.yooHe took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, fromyooanother province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business inyoocompany with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a viciousyoodebauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and managed hisyoobusiness affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, notyooover-scrupulously. Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon,yooand was left from childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up inyoothe house of a general\xe2\x80\x99s widow, a wealthy old lady of good position, whoyoowas at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not know the details, butyooI have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and gentle creature, wasyooonce cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in theyooloft, so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlastingyoonagging of this old woman, who was apparently not bad-h'
12
b'adyoobecome an insufferable tyrant through idleness.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about him and heyoowas refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed an elopementyooto the orphan girl. There is very little doubt that she would not on anyyooaccount have married him if she had known a little more about him in time.yooBut she lived in another province; besides, what could a little girl ofyoosixteen know about it, except that she would be better at the bottom ofyoothe river than remaining with her benefactress. So the poor childyooexchanged a benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get ayoopenny this time, for the general\xe2\x80\x99s widow was furious. She gave themyoonothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on a dowry; whatyooallured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl, above all heryooinnocent appearance, which had a peculiar attraction for a viciousyooprofligate, who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of fem'
12
b'ty.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cThose innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to sayyooafterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this might,yooof course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had received noyoodowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the halter,\xe2\x80\x9d heyoodid not stand on ceremony with her. Making her feel that she had \xe2\x80\x9cwronged\xe2\x80\x9dyoohim, he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness toyootrample on the elementary decencies of marriage. He gathered loose womenyoointo his house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife\xe2\x80\x99syoopresence. To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention thatyooGrigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who hadyooalways hated his first mistress, Adela\xc3\xafda Ivanovna, took the side of hisyoonew mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in ayoomanner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion broke up the revelsyooand drove all the disorderly wom'
12
b'e house. In the end thisyoounhappy young woman, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into thatyookind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant womenyoowho are said to be \xe2\x80\x9cpossessed by devils.\xe2\x80\x9d At times after terrible fits ofyoohysterics she even lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch twoyoosons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and theyoosecond three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourthyooyear, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother allyoohis life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the sameyoothing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya.yooThey were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They wereyoolooked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they wereyoofound by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She wasyoostill alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult doneyooher. All '
12
b'e was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya\xe2\x80\x99syoomanner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings sheyoodeclared aloud two or three times to her retainers:yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cIt serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooExactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna\xe2\x80\x99s death the general\xe2\x80\x99s widowyoosuddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch\xe2\x80\x99syoohouse. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal.yooIt was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had not seen for those eightyooyears, came in to her drunk. The story is that instantly upon seeing him,yoowithout any sort of explanation, she gave him two good, resounding slapsyooon the face, seized him by a tuft of hair, and shook him three times upyooand down. Then, without a word, she went straight to the cottage to theyootwo boys. Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and inyoodirty linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, andyooannouncin'
12
b'ould carry off both the children she wrapped themyoojust as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove off to heryooown town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted slave, without a word,yooand when he escorted the old lady to her carriage he made her a low bowyooand pronounced impressively that, \xe2\x80\x9cGod would repay her for the orphans.\xe2\x80\x9dyoo\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a blockhead all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d the old lady shouted to him as sheyoodrove away.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing, andyoodid not refuse the general\xe2\x80\x99s widow his formal consent to any propositionyooin regard to his children\xe2\x80\x99s education. As for the slaps she had given him,yoohe drove all over the town telling the story.yooyooIt happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left the boysyooin her will a thousand roubles each \xe2\x80\x9cfor their instruction, and so thatyooall be spent on them exclusively, with the condition that it be soyooportioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for '
12
b'hanyooadequate provision for such children. If other people think fit to throwyooaway their money, let them.\xe2\x80\x9d I have not read the will myself, but I heardyoothere was something queer of the sort, very whimsically expressed. Theyooprincipal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of theyooprovince, turned out, however, to be an honest man. Writing to FyodoryooPavlovitch, and discerning at once that he could extract nothing from himyoofor his children\xe2\x80\x99s education (though the latter never directly refused butyooonly procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was, indeed, atyootimes effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a personal interestyooin the orphans. He became especially fond of the younger, Alexey, whoyoolived for a long while as one of his family. I beg the reader to note thisyoofrom the beginning. And to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity andyoohumanity rarely to be met with, the young people were more indebted foryootheir education and bringing up t'
12
b'ne. He kept the two thousandyooroubles left to them by the general\xe2\x80\x99s widow intact, so that by the timeyoothey came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation ofyoointerest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly spentyoofar more than a thousand roubles upon each of them. I won\xe2\x80\x99t enter into ayoodetailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a fewyooof the most important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that heyoogrew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy. Atyooten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own homeyoobut on other people\xe2\x80\x99s charity, and that their father was a man of whom ityoowas disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his infancyyoo(so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude foryoolearning. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know precisely why, but he left the family of YefimyooPetrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a Moscow gymnasium, andyooboar'
12
b' experienced and celebrated teacher, an old friend ofyooYefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due toyoothe \xe2\x80\x9cardor for good works\xe2\x80\x9d of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by theyooidea that the boy\xe2\x80\x99s genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. Butyooneither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young manyoofinished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As Yefim Petrovitchyoohad made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old lady\xe2\x80\x99s legacy,yoowhich had grown from one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing toyooformalities inevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straitsyoofor the first two years at the university, as he was forced to keepyoohimself all the time he was studying. It must be noted that he did notyooeven attempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, fromyoocontempt for him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told himyoothat from such a father he would get no real assistance. How'
12
b'yyoohave been, the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded inyoogetting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards gettingyooparagraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature ofyoo\xe2\x80\x9cEye-Witness.\xe2\x80\x9d These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting andyoopiquant that they were soon taken. This alone showed the young man\xe2\x80\x99syoopractical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy andyoounfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of theyoonewspapers and journals, unable to think of anything better thanyooeverlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French.yooHaving once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always keptyooup his connection with them, and in his latter years at the university heyoopublished brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, soyoothat he became well known in literary circles. But only in his last yearyoohe suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wi'
12
b'fyooreaders, so that a great many people noticed and remembered him. It wasyoorather a curious incident. When he had just left the university and wasyoopreparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitchyoopublished in one of the more important journals a strange article, whichyooattracted general notice, on a subject of which he might have beenyoosupposed to know nothing, as he was a student of natural science. Theyooarticle dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at theyootime\xe2\x80\x94the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing severalyooopinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was mostyoostriking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion.yooMany of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side.yooAnd yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in theiryooapplause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article wasyoonothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I ment'
12
b'identyooparticularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery inyooour neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in theyooquestion of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it.yooLearning the author\xe2\x80\x99s name, they were interested in his being a native ofyoothe town and the son of \xe2\x80\x9cthat Fyodor Pavlovitch.\xe2\x80\x9d And just then it wasyoothat the author himself made his appearance among us.yooyooWhy Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at theyootime with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the firstyoostep leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself.yooIt seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud,yooand apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous houseyooand a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, neveryoothought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given himyoomoney, though he was always afraid that his'
12
b'nd Alexey wouldyooalso come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in theyoohouse of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and theyyoowere on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause ofyoowonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\xc3\xbcsov, ofyoowhom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch\xe2\x80\x99s first wife,yoohappened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He hadyoocome from Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was moreyoosurprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man, whoyoointerested him extremely, and with whom he sometimes argued and notyoowithout an inner pang compared himself in acquirements.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cHe is proud,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say, \xe2\x80\x9che will never be in want of pence; he hasyoogot money enough to go abroad now. What does he want here? Every one canyoosee that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come for money, for his father would never give himyooany. He has no taste for '
12
b'ssipation, and yet his father can\xe2\x80\x99tyoodo without him. They get on so well together!\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooThat was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence over hisyoofather, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and evenyooseemed at times ready to obey his son, though often extremely and evenyoospitefully perverse.yooyooIt was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at the requestyooof, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri, whom he saw foryoothe first time on this very visit, though he had before leaving Moscowyoobeen in correspondence with him about an important matter of more concernyooto Dmitri than himself. What that business was the reader will learn fullyyooin due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance I stillyoofelt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visityoorather mysterious.yooyooI may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediatoryoobetween his father and his elder brother Dmitri, w'
12
b'en quarrelyoowith his father and even planning to bring an action against him.yooyooThe family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of itsyoomembers met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother,yooAlexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of theyoothree to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult toyoospeak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account ofyoohim, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduceyoomy hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had beenyoofor the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to be cloisteredyoothere for the rest of his life.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. The Third Son, AlyoshayooyooyooHe was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth year at theyootime, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven. First of all, Iyoomust explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in myyooopinion at least, was no'
12
b'tic. I may as well give my fullyooopinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, andyoothat he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time ityoostruck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling fromyoothe darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reasonyoothis life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, asyoohe thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to whomyoohe became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart. But Iyoodo not dispute that he was very strange even at that time, and had been soyooindeed from his cradle. I have mentioned already, by the way, that thoughyoohe lost his mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his life\xe2\x80\x94heryooface, her caresses, \xe2\x80\x9cas though she stood living before me.\xe2\x80\x9d Such memoriesyoomay persist, as every one knows, from an even earlier age, even from twoyooyears old, but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like s'
12
b'ght out of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, whichyoohas all faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it wasyoowith him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, theyooslanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most vividly of all);yooin a corner of the room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp, and onyooher knees before the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with cries andyoomoans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close till it hurt,yooand praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out in both arms toyoothe image as though to put him under the Mother\xe2\x80\x99s protection ... andyoosuddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her in terror. That was theyoopicture! And Alyosha remembered his mother\xe2\x80\x99s face at that minute. He usedyooto say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he rarelyyoocared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood and youth heyoowas by no means expansive, and talked lit'
12
b'but not from shynessyooor a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from something different,yoofrom a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned withyooother people, but so important to him that he seemed, as it were, toyooforget others on account of it. But he was fond of people: he seemedyoothroughout his life to put implicit trust in people: yet no one everyoolooked on him as a simpleton or na\xc3\xafve person. There was something aboutyoohim which made one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards)yoothat he did not care to be a judge of others\xe2\x80\x94that he would never take ityooupon himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything. Heyooseemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation thoughyoooften grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one couldyoosurprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth. Coming at twenty toyoohis father\xe2\x80\x99s house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he, chasteyooand pure as he was, si'
12
b'w in silence when to look on wasyoounbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation.yooHis father, who had once been in a dependent position, and so wasyoosensitive and ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust andyoosullenness. \xe2\x80\x9cHe does not say much,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say, \xe2\x80\x9cand thinks the more.\xe2\x80\x9dyooBut soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and kissingyoohim terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality, yetyoohe evidently felt a real and deep affection for him, such as he had neveryoobeen capable of feeling for any one before.yooyooEvery one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and it was soyoofrom his earliest childhood. When he entered the household of his patronyooand benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he gained the hearts of all theyoofamily, so that they looked on him quite as their own child. Yet heyooentered the house at such a tender age that he could not have acted fromyoodesign nor artfulness in winni'
12
b'. So that the gift of makingyoohimself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him, in his veryyoonature, so to speak. It was the same at school, though he seemed to beyoojust one of those children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, andyooeven disliked by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, andyoorather solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping intoyooa corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he wasyooat school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see at theyoofirst glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the contrary he wasyoobright and good-tempered. He never tried to show off among hisyooschoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never afraid of any one,yooyet the boys immediately understood that he was not proud of hisyoofearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was bold and courageous. Heyoonever resented an insult. It would happen that an hour after the offenseyoohe would address the offen'
12
b'r some question with as trustful andyoocandid an expression as though nothing had happened between them. And ityoowas not that he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven theyooaffront, but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and thisyoocompletely conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristicyoowhich made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want toyoomock at him, not from malice but because it amused them. Thisyoocharacteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity. He could notyoobear to hear certain words and certain conversations about women. Thereyooare \xe2\x80\x9ccertain\xe2\x80\x9d words and conversations unhappily impossible to eradicate inyooschools. Boys pure in mind and heart, almost children, are fond of talkingyooin school among themselves, and even aloud, of things, pictures, andyooimages of which even soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More thanyoothat, much that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar toyooquite you'
12
b'of our intellectual and higher classes. There is noyoomoral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is theyooappearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as somethingyoorefined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing that AlyoshayooKaramazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of \xe2\x80\x9cthat,\xe2\x80\x9d theyyooused sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands away, and shoutyoonastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped to the floor, triedyooto hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring their insultsyooin silence. But at last they left him alone and gave up taunting him withyoobeing a \xe2\x80\x9cregular girl,\xe2\x80\x9d and what\xe2\x80\x99s more they looked upon it withyoocompassion as a weakness. He was always one of the best in the class butyoowas never first.yooyooAt the time of Yefim Petrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s death Alyosha had two more years toyoocomplete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable widow went almostyooimmediately after his death for a long visit to'
12
b'her wholeyoofamily, which consisted only of women and girls. Alyosha went to live inyoothe house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he hadyoonever seen before. On what terms he lived with them he did not knowyoohimself. It was very characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared atyoowhose expense he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast toyoohis elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two yearsyooin the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and had fromyoochildhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of hisyoobenefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s character must not, Iyoothink, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance withyoohim any one would have perceived that Alyosha was one of those youths,yooalmost of the type of religious enthusiast, who, if they were suddenly toyoocome into possession of a large fortune, would not hesitate to give ityooaway for the asking, either for go'
12
b'perhaps to a clever rogue.yooIn general he seemed scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course,yooin a literal sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never askedyoofor, he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in ayoomoment, or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.yooyooIn later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\xc3\xbcsov, a man very sensitive on theyooscore of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following judgment,yooafter getting to know Alyosha:yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cHere is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave aloneyoowithout a penny, in the center of an unknown town of a millionyooinhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not die of cold andyoohunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once; and if he were not, heyoowould find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him no effort oryoohumiliation. And to shelter him would be no burden, but, on the contrary,yoowould probably be looked on as a pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooHe did not'
12
b'studies at the gymnasium. A year before the end ofyoothe course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he was going to seeyoohis father about a plan which had occurred to him. They were sorry andyoounwilling to let him go. The journey was not an expensive one, and theyooladies would not let him pawn his watch, a parting present from hisyoobenefactor\xe2\x80\x99s family. They provided him liberally with money and evenyoofitted him out with new clothes and linen. But he returned half the moneyyoothey gave him, saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrivalyooin the town he made no answer to his father\xe2\x80\x99s first inquiry why he hadyoocome before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusuallyyoothoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his mother\xe2\x80\x99syootomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that was the onlyyooobject of his visit. But it can hardly have been the whole reason of it.yooIt is more probable that he himself did not understand and could notyooexp'
12
b'd suddenly arisen in his soul, and drawn him irresistiblyyoointo a new, unknown, but inevitable path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not showyoohim where his second wife was buried, for he had never visited her graveyoosince he had thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years hadyooentirely forgotten where she was buried.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not beenyooliving in our town. Three or four years after his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death he had goneyooto the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa, where he spentyooseveral years. He made the acquaintance at first, in his own words, \xe2\x80\x9cof ayoolot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,\xe2\x80\x9d and ended by being received byyoo\xe2\x80\x9cJews high and low alike.\xe2\x80\x9d It may be presumed that at this period heyoodeveloped a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding money. He finallyyooreturned to our town only three years before Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. His formeryooacquaintances found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means'
12
b'n. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with moreyooeffrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for makingyoobuffoons of others. His depravity with women was not simply what it usedyooto be, but even more revolting. In a short time he opened a great numberyooof new taverns in the district. It was evident that he had perhaps ayoohundred thousand roubles or not much less. Many of the inhabitants of theyootown and district were soon in his debt, and, of course, had given goodyoosecurity. Of late, too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed moreyooirresponsible, more uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used toyoobegin one thing and go on with another, as though he were letting himselfyoogo altogether. He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had notyoobeen for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged considerablyyootoo, and used to look after him sometimes almost like a tutor, FyodoryooPavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes. Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s arri'
12
b'oto affect even his moral side, as though something had awakened in thisyooprematurely old man which had long been dead in his soul.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you areyoolike her, \xe2\x80\x98the crazy woman\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was what he used to call his dead wife,yooAlyosha\xe2\x80\x99s mother. Grigory it was who pointed out the \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy woman\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d graveyooto Alyosha. He took him to our town cemetery and showed him in a remoteyoocorner a cast-iron tombstone, cheap but decently kept, on which wereyooinscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date of her death, andyoobelow a four-lined verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashionedyoomiddle-class tombs. To Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s amazement this tomb turned out to beyooGrigory\xe2\x80\x99s doing. He had put it up on the poor \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy woman\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d grave at hisyooown expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had often pestered about theyoograve, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the grave and all his memories.yooAlyosha showed no particu'
12
b'at the sight of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s grave.yooHe only listened to Grigory\xe2\x80\x99s minute and solemn account of the erection ofyoothe tomb; he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering ayooword. It was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But thisyoolittle episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch\xe2\x80\x94and ayoovery original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery toyoopay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for the second,yooAlyosha\xe2\x80\x99s mother, the \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy woman,\xe2\x80\x9d but for the first, Adela\xc3\xafda Ivanovna,yoowho used to thrash him. In the evening of the same day he got drunk andyooabused the monks to Alyosha. He himself was far from being religious; heyoohad probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strangeyooimpulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.yooyooI have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance at thisyootime bore traces of something that testified unmistakably t'
12
b'eyoohad led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his little, always insolent,yoosuspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles inyoohis little fat face, the Adam\xe2\x80\x99s apple hung below his sharp chin like ayoogreat, fleshy goiter, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive, sensualyooappearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips, betweenyoowhich could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth. He slobberedyooevery time he began to speak. He was fond indeed of making fun of his ownyooface, though, I believe, he was well satisfied with it. He usedyooparticularly to point to his nose, which was not very large, but veryyoodelicate and conspicuously aquiline. \xe2\x80\x9cA regular Roman nose,\xe2\x80\x9d he used toyoosay, \xe2\x80\x9cwith my goiter I\xe2\x80\x99ve quite the countenance of an ancient Romanyoopatrician of the decadent period.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed proud of it.yooyooNot long after visiting his mother\xe2\x80\x99s grave Alyosha suddenly announced thatyoohe wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks were'
12
b'ooreceive him as a novice. He explained that this was his strong desire, andyoothat he was solemnly asking his consent as his father. The old man knewyoothat the elder Zossima, who was living in the monastery hermitage, hadyoomade a special impression upon his \xe2\x80\x9cgentle boy.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the most honest monk among them, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, afteryoolistening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming scarcely surprisedyooat his request. \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!... So that\xe2\x80\x99s where you want to be, my gentle boy?\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooHe was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken grin,yoowhich was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness. \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!... I hadyooa presentiment that you would end in something like this. Would youyoobelieve it? You were making straight for it. Well, to be sure you haveyooyour own two thousand. That\xe2\x80\x99s a dowry for you. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll never desert you,yoomy angel. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay what\xe2\x80\x99s wanted for you there, if they ask for it.yooBut, of course, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t '
12
b'uld we worry them? What do youyoosay? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week. H\xe2\x80\x99m!...yooDo you know that near one monastery there\xe2\x80\x99s a place outside the town whereyooevery baby knows there are none but \xe2\x80\x98the monks\xe2\x80\x99 wives\xe2\x80\x99 living, as they areyoocalled. Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99syoointeresting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it isyooit\xe2\x80\x99s awfully Russian. There are no French women there. Of course theyyoocould get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hearyooof it they\xe2\x80\x99ll come along. Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing of that sort here, noyoo\xe2\x80\x98monks\xe2\x80\x99 wives,\xe2\x80\x99 and two hundred monks. They\xe2\x80\x99re honest. They keep theyoofasts. I admit it.... H\xe2\x80\x99m.... So you want to be a monk? And do you knowyooI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would you believe it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve really grownyoofond of you? Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good opportunity. You\xe2\x80\x99ll pray for us sinners; weyoohave sinned too much here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been t'
12
b'would pray foryoome, and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I\xe2\x80\x99myooawfully stupid about that. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Awfully. You see,yoohowever stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep thinking\xe2\x80\x94from timeyooto time, of course, not all the while. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, I think, for theyoodevils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die. ThenyooI wonder\xe2\x80\x94hooks? Where would they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where doyoothey forge them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in theyoomonastery probably believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a ceiling in hell, for instance.yooNow I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling. It makes it moreyoorefined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is. And, after all, whatyoodoes it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn\xe2\x80\x99t? But, do you know,yoothere\xe2\x80\x99s a damnable question involved in it? If there\xe2\x80\x99s no ceiling thereyoocan be no hooks, and if there are no hooks it all breaks down, which isyoounlike'
12
b'r then there would be none to drag me down to hell, andyooif they don\xe2\x80\x99t drag me down what justice is there in the world? _Ilyoofaudrait les inventer_, those hooks, on purpose for me alone, for, if youyooonly knew, Alyosha, what a blackguard I am.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are no hooks there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alyosha, looking gently and seriouslyyooat his father.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That\xe2\x80\x99s how ayooFrenchman described hell: \xe2\x80\x98_J\xe2\x80\x99ai bu l\xe2\x80\x99ombre d\xe2\x80\x99un cocher qui avec l\xe2\x80\x99ombreyood\xe2\x80\x99une brosse frottait l\xe2\x80\x99ombre d\xe2\x80\x99une carrosse._\xe2\x80\x99 How do you know there areyoono hooks, darling? When you\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with the monks you\xe2\x80\x99ll sing ayoodifferent tune. But go and get at the truth there, and then come and tellyoome. Anyway it\xe2\x80\x99s easier going to the other world if one knows what there isyoothere. Besides, it will be more seemly for you with the monks than hereyoowith me, with a drunken old man and young harlots ... though you\xe2\x80\x99re likeyooan angel, nothing touches you. And'
12
b'nothing will touch youyoothere. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I let you go, because I hope for that. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got allyooyour wits about you. You will burn and you will burn out; you will beyoohealed and come back again. And I will wait for you. I feel that you\xe2\x80\x99reyoothe only creature in the world who has not condemned me. My dear boy, Iyoofeel it, you know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling it.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooAnd he even began blubbering. He was sentimental. He was wicked andyoosentimental.yooyooyooyooChapter V. EldersyooyooyooSome of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly, ecstatic,yoopoorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive dreamer. On the contrary,yooAlyosha was at this time a well-grown, red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad ofyoonineteen, radiant with health. He was very handsome, too, graceful,yoomoderately tall, with hair of a dark brown, with a regular, rather long,yoooval-shaped face, and wide-set dark gray, shining eyes; he was veryyoothoughtful, and apparently very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that redyo'
12
b'not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancyyoothat Alyosha was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in theyoomonastery he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles areyoonever a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that disposeyoorealists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, willyooalways find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and ifyoohe is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would ratheryoodisbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he admits it, heyooadmits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith doesyoonot, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith.yooIf the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism toyooadmit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would notyoobelieve till he saw, but when he did see he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord and my God!\xe2\x80\x9dyooWas it the miracle forced him to believe? Most likely not, but '
12
b'oosolely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in hisyoosecret heart even when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe till I see.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooI shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had notyoofinished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies isyootrue, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.yooI\xe2\x80\x99ll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon this path onlyyoobecause, at that time, it alone struck his imagination and presentedyooitself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for his soul fromyoodarkness to light. Add to that that he was to some extent a youth of ouryoolast epoch\xe2\x80\x94that is, honest in nature, desiring the truth, seeking for ityooand believing in it, and seeking to serve it at once with all the strengthyooof his soul, seeking for immediate action, and ready to sacrificeyooeverything, life itself, for it. Though these young men unhappily fail toyoounderstand that the sacrifice of life is, in ma'
12
b'e easiest ofyooall sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance, five or six years ofyootheir seething youth to hard and tedious study, if only to multiplyyootenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have setyoobefore them as their goal\xe2\x80\x94such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strengthyooof many of them. The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the oppositeyoodirection, but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. Asyoosoon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of Godyooand immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI want toyoolive for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.\xe2\x80\x9d In the same way,yooif he had decided that God and immortality did not exist, he would at onceyoohave become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism is not merely theyoolabor question, it is before all things the atheistic question, theyooquestion of the form taken by atheism to-day, the question of the tower ofyooBabel built without God'
12
b'nt to heaven from earth but to set upyooheaven on earth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to goyooon living as before. It is written: \xe2\x80\x9cGive all that thou hast to the pooryooand follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooAlyosha said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t give two roubles instead of \xe2\x80\x98all,\xe2\x80\x99 andyooonly go to mass instead of \xe2\x80\x98following Him.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps his memories ofyoochildhood brought back our monastery, to which his mother may have takenyoohim to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which hisyoopoor \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy\xe2\x80\x9d mother had held him up still acted upon his imagination.yooBrooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps only to seeyoowhether here he could sacrifice all or only \xe2\x80\x9ctwo roubles,\xe2\x80\x9d and in theyoomonastery he met this elder. I must digress to explain what an \xe2\x80\x9celder\xe2\x80\x9d isyooin Russian monasteries, and I am sorry that I do not feel very competentyooto do so. I will try, however, to give a superficial account of it in ayoofew '
12
b'rities on the subject assert that the institution ofyoo\xe2\x80\x9celders\xe2\x80\x9d is of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in ouryoomonasteries, though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos,yooit has existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed inyooancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtookyooRussia\xe2\x80\x94the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations with the Eastyooafter the destruction of Constantinople\xe2\x80\x94this institution fell intoyoooblivion. It was revived among us towards the end of last century by oneyooof the great \xe2\x80\x9cascetics,\xe2\x80\x9d as they called him, Pa\xc3\xafssy Velitchkovsky, and hisyoodisciples. But to this day it exists in few monasteries only, and hasyoosometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia. It flourishedyooespecially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it wasyoointroduced into our monastery I cannot say. There had already been threeyoosuch elders and Zossima was the last of them. But'
12
b'st dying ofyooweakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The questionyoofor our monastery was an important one, for it had not been distinguishedyooby anything in particular till then: they had neither relics of saints,yoonor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious traditions, nor historicalyooexploits. It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through itsyooelders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of milesyoofrom all parts.yooyooWhat was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul, your will,yoointo his soul and his will. When you choose an elder, you renounce youryooown will and yield it to him in complete submission, completeyooself-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, isyooundertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest, of self-mastery, inyooorder, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, fromyooself; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life withoutyoofinding their true'
12
b'hemselves. This institution of elders is notyoofounded on theory, but was established in the East from the practice of ayoothousand years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinaryyoo\xe2\x80\x9cobedience\xe2\x80\x9d which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. Theyooobligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submittedyoothemselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him and them.yooyooThe story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianityyooone such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon him by hisyooelder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt. There, after greatyooexploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a martyr\xe2\x80\x99syoodeath for the faith. When the Church, regarding him as a saint, wasyooburying him, suddenly, at the deacon\xe2\x80\x99s exhortation, \xe2\x80\x9cDepart all yeyoounbaptized,\xe2\x80\x9d the coffin containing the martyr\xe2\x80\x99s body left its place andyoowas cast forth from the church, and this took place three times. And onlyyooat '
12
b'arnt that this holy man had broken his vow of obedience andyooleft his elder, and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder\xe2\x80\x99syooabsolution in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeralyootake place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recentyooinstance.yooyooA monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos, which he lovedyooas a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go first to Jerusalem toyoodo homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the north to Siberia:yoo\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the place for thee and not here.\xe2\x80\x9d The monk, overwhelmed withyoosorrow, went to the \xc5\x92cumenical Patriarch at Constantinople and besoughtyoohim to release him from his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that notyooonly was he unable to release him, but there was not and could not be onyooearth a power which could release him except the elder who had himselfyoolaid that duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certainyoocases with unbounded and inexplicabl'
12
b' That is why in many ofyooour monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost toyoopersecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly esteemedyooamong the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well as men ofyoodistinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our monastery toyooconfess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings, and ask foryoocounsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of the elders declaredyoothat the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily and frivolouslyyoodegraded, though the continual opening of the heart to the elder by theyoomonk or the layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament. In theyooend, however, the institution of elders has been retained and is becomingyooestablished in Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that thisyooinstrument which had stood the test of a thousand years for the moralyooregeneration of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibilityyoomay be a two-edged weapon and it may lead som'
12
b'ility andyoocomplete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to bondageyooand not to freedom.yooyooThe elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners, hadyoobeen in the army in early youth, and served in the Caucasus as an officer.yooHe had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar quality of his soul.yooAlyosha lived in the cell of the elder, who was very fond of him and letyoohim wait upon him. It must be noted that Alyosha was bound by noyooobligation and could go where he pleased and be absent for whole days.yooThough he wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be differentyoofrom others. No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imaginationyoowas deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that soyoomany people had for years past come to confess their sins to FatheryooZossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing, that he hadyooacquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an unknown face what ayoonew-com'
12
b'nd what was the suffering on his conscience. Heyoosometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge ofyootheir secrets before they had spoken a word.yooyooAlyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the firstyootime with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happyyoofaces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima wasyoonot at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monksyooused to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and theyoogreater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to theyooend of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but theyyoowere few in number and they were silent, though among them were some ofyoogreat dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monksyoodistinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But theyoomajority were on Father Zossima\xe2\x80\x99s side and very many of them loved himyoowith all th'
12
b'warmly and sincerely. Some were almost fanaticallyyoodevoted to him, and declared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint,yoothat there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near,yoothey anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in theyooimmediate future from his relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in theyoomiraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in theyoostory of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came withyoosick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them andyooto pray over them, return shortly after\xe2\x80\x94some the next day\xe2\x80\x94and, falling inyootears at the elder\xe2\x80\x99s feet, thank him for healing their sick.yooyooWhether they had really been healed or were simply better in the naturalyoocourse of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, foryoohe fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced inyoohis fame, in his glory, as though it were his own triumph. His h'
12
b'bed, and he beamed, as it were, all over when the elder came out toyoothe gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd of pilgrims of theyoohumbler class who had flocked from all parts of Russia on purpose to seeyoothe elder and obtain his blessing. They fell down before him, wept, kissedyoohis feet, kissed the earth on which he stood, and wailed, while the womenyooheld up their children to him and brought him the sick \xe2\x80\x9cpossessed withyoodevils.\xe2\x80\x9d The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessedyoothem, and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks ofyooillness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and the pilgrimsyoowaited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha did not wonder whyyoothey loved him so, why they fell down before him and wept with emotionyoomerely at seeing his face. Oh! he understood that for the humble soul ofyoothe Russian peasant, worn out by grief and toil, and still more by theyooeverlasting injustice and everlasting sin, h'
12
b'he world\xe2\x80\x99s, it wasyoothe greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to fallyoodown before and worship.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cAmong us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere onyooearth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the truth; he knows theyootruth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it will come one day to us,yootoo, and rule over all the earth according to the promise.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooAlyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned. Heyoounderstood it, but that the elder Zossima was this saint and custodian ofyooGod\xe2\x80\x99s truth\xe2\x80\x94of that he had no more doubt than the weeping peasants and theyoosick women who held out their children to the elder. The conviction thatyooafter his death the elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monasteryyoowas even stronger in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kindyooof deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart.yooHe was not at all troubled at this elder\xe2\x80\x99s standing a'
12
b' exampleyoobefore him.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of renewal foryooall: that power which will, at last, establish truth on the earth, and allyoomen will be holy and love one another, and there will be no more rich noryoopoor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will be as the children of God, andyoothe true Kingdom of Christ will come.\xe2\x80\x9d That was the dream in Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99syooheart.yooyooThe arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till then, seemedyooto make a great impression on Alyosha. He more quickly made friends withyoohis half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived later) than with his ownyoobrother Ivan. He was extremely interested in his brother Ivan, but whenyoothe latter had been two months in the town, though they had met fairlyyoooften, they were still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and heyooseemed to be expecting something, ashamed about something, while hisyoobrother Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long andyoocu'
12
b'im, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him. Alyoshayoonoticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his brother\xe2\x80\x99s indifferenceyooat first to the disparity of their age and education. But he also wonderedyoowhether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to someyooother cause entirely unknown to him. He kept fancying that Ivan wasyooabsorbed in something\xe2\x80\x94something inward and important\xe2\x80\x94that he was strivingyootowards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why heyoohad no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not someyoocontempt on the part of the learned atheist for him\xe2\x80\x94a foolish novice. Heyooknew for certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not takeyoooffense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassmentyoowhich he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to comeyoonearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect andyoowith a peculiar earnestness. From him Alyosha '
12
b'he details ofyoothe important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkableyoobond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic references toyooIvan were the more striking in Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s eyes since Dmitri was, comparedyoowith Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast inyoopersonality and character that it would be difficult to find two men moreyoounlike.yooyooIt was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the membersyooof this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who hadyoosuch an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The pretext for this gatheringyoowas a false one. It was at this time that the discord between Dmitri andyoohis father seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had becomeyooinsufferably strained. Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first toyoosuggest, apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima\xe2\x80\x99syoocell, and that, without appealing to his direct intervention, they might'
12
b'ntly come to an understanding under the conciliating influence ofyoothe elder\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder, naturallyyoosupposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but, as he secretlyyooblamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father on severalyoorecent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It must be noted that he wasyoonot, like Ivan, staying with his father, but living apart at the other endyooof the town. It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\xc3\xbcsov, who was stayingyooin the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of theyooforties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on byyooboredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized withyoothe desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with theyoomonastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing theyooSuperior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming withyoosuch laudable intentions might be received'
12
b'ttention andyooconsideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences fromyoowithin the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late hadyooscarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even hisyooordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day wasyoofixed.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cWho has made me a judge over them?\xe2\x80\x9d was all he said, smilingly, toyooAlyosha.yooyooAlyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all theyoowrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard theyoointerview seriously. All the others would come from frivolous motives,yooperhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan andyooMi\xc3\xbcsov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while hisyoofather might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he saidyoonothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, wasyoofar from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the day withyo'
12
b'rt. No doubt he was always pondering in his mind how the familyyoodiscord could be ended. But his chief anxiety concerned the elder. Heyootrembled for him, for his glory, and dreaded any affront to him,yooespecially the refined, courteous irony of Mi\xc3\xbcsov and the superciliousyoohalf-utterances of the highly educated Ivan. He even wanted to venture onyoowarning the elder, telling him something about them, but, on secondyoothoughts, said nothing. He only sent word the day before, through ayoofriend, to his brother Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keepyoohis promise. Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he hadyoopromised, but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to letyoohimself be provoked \xe2\x80\x9cby vileness,\xe2\x80\x9d but that, although he had a deepyoorespect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that theyoomeeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking in respectyooto t'
12
b'an whom you reverence so highly,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in conclusion.yooAlyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.yooyooyooyooyooBook II. An Unfortunate GatheringyooyooyooyooChapter I. They Arrive At The MonasteryyooyooyooIt was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview with theyooelder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately after late mass.yooOur visitors did not take part in the service, but arrived just as it wasyooover. First an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses, droveyooup with Mi\xc3\xbcsov and a distant relative of his, a young man of twenty,yoocalled Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This young man was preparing to enter theyoouniversity. Mi\xc3\xbcsov, with whom he was staying for the time, was trying toyoopersuade him to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The youngyooman was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He wasyoonice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange fixityyooin his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded pe'
12
b'dyoosometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was silent and ratheryooawkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with any one, he becameyootalkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything or nothing. But hisyooanimation vanished as quickly as it appeared. He was always well and evenyooelaborately dressed; he had already some independent fortune andyooexpectations of much more. He was a friend of Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s.yooyooIn an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of oldyoopinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Mi\xc3\xbcsov\xe2\x80\x99s carriage, came FyodoryooPavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though he had beenyooinformed of the time the evening before. The visitors left their carriageyooat the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of theyoomonastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had everyooseen the monastery, and Mi\xc3\xbcsov had probably not even been to church foryoothirty years. He looked about him with curiosity, together with assumedyooe'
12
b'cept the church and the domestic buildings, though these tooyoowere ordinary enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of theyoomonastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the church,yoobareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler people were a few ofyoohigher rank\xe2\x80\x94two or three ladies and a very old general. They were allyoostaying at the hotel. Our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars, butyoonone of them gave them anything, except young Kalganov, who took ayooten-copeck piece out of his purse, and, nervous and embarrassed\xe2\x80\x94God knowsyoowhy!\xe2\x80\x94hurriedly gave it to an old woman, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cDivide it equally.\xe2\x80\x9d Noneyooof his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no reason to beyooembarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more overcome.yooyooIt was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that theyyoowere not received with special honor, though one of them had recently madeyooa donation of a thousand roubles, while another was'

Yet no official personage met them.yooyooMi\xc3\xbcsov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the church, and wasyooon the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a prettyyoopenny for the right of lying in this \xe2\x80\x9choly place,\xe2\x80\x9d but refrained. Hisyooliberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must find out,yoofor time is passing,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed suddenly, as though speaking to himself.yooyooAll at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiatingyoolittle eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat.

It is a long time since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cThis way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the copse. Comeyoowith me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you. I have to go.... I am going myself.yooThis way, this way.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooThey came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov, a man ofyoosixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare at them all, withyooan incredible degree of nervous curiosity. His eyes looked starting out ofyoohis head.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,\xe2\x80\x9d observedyooMi\xc3\xbcsov severely. \xe2\x80\x9cThat personage has granted us an audience, so to speak,yooand so, though we thank you for showing us the way, we cannot ask you toyooaccompany us.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been there. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been already; _un chevalier parfait_,\xe2\x80\x9d and Maximovyoosnapped his fingers in the air'
12
b'o is a _chevalier_?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mi\xc3\xbcsov.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cThe elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory of theyoomonastery, Zossima. Such an elder!\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooBut his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking monk ofyoomedium height, wearing a monk\xe2\x80\x99s cap, who overtook them. Fyodor Pavlovitchyooand Mi\xc3\xbcsov stopped.yooyooThe monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cThe Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him afteryooyour visit to the hermitage. At one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, not later. And you also,\xe2\x80\x9d heyooadded, addressing Maximov.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cThat I certainly will, without fail,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, hugelyyoodelighted at the invitation. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, believe me, we\xe2\x80\x99ve all given our word toyoobehave properly here.... And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the customs here?yooThe only obstacle to me is your company....\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent a'
12
b'yoo\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a capital thing if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn up. Do you suppose I likeyooall this business, and in your company, too? So we will come to dinner.yooThank the Father Superior,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the monk.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the monk.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cIf so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to the Father Superior\xe2\x80\x94to the Father Superior,\xe2\x80\x9dyoobabbled Maximov.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cThe Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the monkyoohesitated.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cImpertinent old man!\xe2\x80\x9d Mi\xc3\xbcsov observed aloud, while Maximov ran back toyoothe monastery.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s like von Sohn,\xe2\x80\x9d Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von Sohn? Haveyooyou ever seen von Sohn?\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen his portrait. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the features, but something indefinable.yooHe\xe2\x80\x99s a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the physiognomy.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, FyodoryooPavlovitch, you '
12
b'w that we had given our word to behaveyooproperly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you beginyooto play the fool I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to be associated with you here.... You seeyoowhat a man he is\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he turned to the monk\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to go among decentyoopeople with him.\xe2\x80\x9d A fine smile, not without a certain slyness, came on toyoothe pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he made no reply, and wasyooevidently silent from a sense of his own dignity. Mi\xc3\xbcsov frowned more thanyooever.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cOh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through centuries, andyoonothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,\xe2\x80\x9d flashed throughyooMi\xc3\xbcsov\xe2\x80\x99s mind.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the hermitage. We\xe2\x80\x99ve arrived,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gatesyooare shut.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooAnd he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted aboveyooand on the sides of the gates.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this hermitageyoothere are twenty-five saints '
12
b' They look at one another, andyooeat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate. That\xe2\x80\x99s what isyooremarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that the elder receivesyooladies,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked suddenly to the monk.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cWomen of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there waiting.yooBut for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining theyooportico, but outside the precincts\xe2\x80\x94you can see the windows\xe2\x80\x94and the elderyoogoes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough. They areyooalways outside the precincts. There is a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov,yoowaiting there now with her sick daughter. Probably he has promised to comeyooout to her, though of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shownyoohimself even to the people.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cSo then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage toyoothe ladies. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm. But do youyooknow that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed'
12
b'reature of the female sex\xe2\x80\x94no hens, nor turkey-hens, nor cows.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cFyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you here. They\xe2\x80\x99llyooturn you out when I\xe2\x80\x99m gone.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,\xe2\x80\x9d he criedyoosuddenly, stepping within the precincts, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a vale of roses they liveyooin!\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooThough there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and beautifulyooautumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them, and evidentlyyootended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds round the church, andyoobetween the tombs; and the one-storied wooden house where the elder livedyoowas also surrounded with flowers.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy? He didn\xe2\x80\x99tyoocare for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and thrash even ladiesyoowith a stick,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he went up the steps.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cThe elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a great dealyoothat'
12
b' foolishness. He never thrashed any one,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the monk.yoo\xe2\x80\x9cNow, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I will announce you.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cFyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you hear? Behaveyooproperly or I will pay you out!\xe2\x80\x9d Mi\xc3\xbcsov had time to mutter again.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think why you are so agitated,\xe2\x80\x9d Fyodor Pavlovitch observedyoosarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you uneasy about your sins? They say he can tell byyooone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes what one has come about. And what a lot you think of theiryooopinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at you.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooBut Mi\xc3\xbcsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were asked to comeyooin. He walked in, somewhat irritated.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and begin toyooquarrel\xe2\x80\x94and lower myself and my ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected.yooyooyooyooChapter II. The Old BuffoonyooyooyooThey entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came inyoofrom his bedroom. There were already in the cell,'
12
b'e elder, twoyoomonks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian, and the other FatheryooPa\xc3\xafssy, a very learned man, so they said, in delicate health, though notyooold. There was also a tall young man, who looked about two and twenty,yoostanding in the corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, freshyooface, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinaryyoodress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of theyoomonastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,yooreverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so not on anyooequality with the guests, he did not greet them with a bow.yooyooFather Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two monksyoorose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground with theiryoofingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder replied with asyoodeep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony wasyooperformed very seriously and with an'
12
b'of feeling, not like anyooeveryday rite. But Mi\xc3\xbcsov fancied that it was all done with intentionalyooimpressiveness. He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought\xe2\x80\x94he hadyooreflected upon it the evening before\xe2\x80\x94from simple politeness, since it wasyoothe custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, even ifyoohe did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing onyoothe part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignifiedyoogravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to ayoochair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Mi\xc3\xbcsov like an ape. Ivanyoobowed with great dignity and courtesy, but he too kept his hands at hisyoosides, while Kalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all. Theyooelder let fall the hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again,yooasked them all to sit down. The blood rushed to Alyosha\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks. He wasyooashamed. His forebodings were coming true.yooyooFather Zossima sat down on a very old-fa'
12
b'gany sofa, coveredyoowith leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along the oppositeyoowall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black leather. The monksyoosat, one at the door and the other at the window. The divinity student,yoothe novice, and Alyosha remained standing. The cell was not very large andyoohad a faded look. It contained nothing but the most necessary furniture,yooof coarse and poor quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window,yooand a number of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikonyooof the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures inyooshining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china eggs, a Catholicyoocross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it, and several foreignyooengravings from the great Italian artists of past centuries. Next to theseyoocostly and artistic engravings were several of the roughest Russian printsyooof saints and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all theyoofairs. '
12
b' walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past andyoopresent.yooyooMi\xc3\xbcsov took a cursory glance at all these \xe2\x80\x9cconventional\xe2\x80\x9d surroundings andyoobent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high opinion of his ownyooinsight, a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty, an age at which ayooclever man of the world of established position can hardly help takingyoohimself rather seriously. At the first moment he did not like Zossima.yooThere was, indeed, something in the elder\xe2\x80\x99s face which many people besidesyooMi\xc3\xbcsov might not have liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with veryyooweak legs, and though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten yearsyooolder. His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,yooparticularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored,yooquick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling of grayyoohair about his temples. His pointed beard was small and scanty, and hisyoolips, which smiled frequently, were as thin '
12
b'ds. His nose wasyoonot long, but sharp, like a bird\xe2\x80\x99s beak.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cTo all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,\xe2\x80\x9d thoughtyooMi\xc3\xbcsov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.yooyooA cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served toyoobegin the conversation.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely to our time,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \xe2\x80\x9cbut no sign of my son,yooDmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!\xe2\x80\x9d (Alyosha shuddered all over atyoo\xe2\x80\x9csacred elder.\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cI am always punctual myself, minute for minute,yooremembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings....\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not a king, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d Mi\xc3\xbcsov muttered, losing hisyooself-restraint at once.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that\xe2\x80\x99s true. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a king, and, would you believe it, PyotryooAlexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I always say theyoowrong thing. Your reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, with sudden pathos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou beholdyoobefore you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce myself as such. It\xe2\x80\x99s an oldy'
12
b's! And if I sometimes talk nonsense out of place it\xe2\x80\x99s with anyooobject, with the object of amusing people and making myself agreeable. Oneyoomust be agreeable, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t one? I was seven years ago in a little townyoowhere I had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. Weyoowent to the captain of police because we had to see him about something,yooand to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair, sulky man, theyoomost dangerous type in such cases. It\xe2\x80\x99s their liver. I went straight up toyoohim, and with the ease of a man of the world, you know, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Ispravnik,\xe2\x80\x99yoosaid I, \xe2\x80\x98be our Napravnik.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by Napravnik?\xe2\x80\x99 said he. Iyoosaw, at the first half-second, that it had missed fire. He stood there soyooglum. \xe2\x80\x98I wanted to make a joke,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98for the general diversion, asyooMr. Napravnik is our well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what weyooneed for the harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.\xe2\x80\x99 And Iyooexplained my comparison '
12
b'bly, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? \xe2\x80\x98Excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,yoo\xe2\x80\x98I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on my calling.\xe2\x80\x99 Heyooturned and walked away. I followed him, shouting, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, you are anyooIspravnik, not a Napravnik.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98since you called me ayooNapravnik I am one.\xe2\x80\x99 And would you believe it, it ruined our business! AndyooI\xe2\x80\x99m always like that, always like that. Always injuring myself with myyoopoliteness. Once, many years ago, I said to an influential person: \xe2\x80\x98Youryoowife is a ticklish lady,\xe2\x80\x99 in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities,yooso to speak. But he asked me, \xe2\x80\x98Why, have you tickled her?\xe2\x80\x99 I thought I\xe2\x80\x99dyoobe polite, so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help saying, \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 and he gave me a fineyootickling on the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not ashamed toyootell the story. I\xe2\x80\x99m always injuring myself like that.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re doing it now,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mi\xc3\xbcsov, with disgust.yooyooFather Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cAm I? '
12
b'lieve it, I was aware of that, too, PyotryooAlexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as soon asyooI began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that you\xe2\x80\x99d be the firstyooto remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming off, youryooreverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the loweryoojaw and there is almost a spasm in them. That\xe2\x80\x99s been so since I was young,yoowhen I had to make jokes for my living in noblemen\xe2\x80\x99s families. I am anyooinveterate buffoon, and have been from birth up, your reverence, it\xe2\x80\x99s asyoothough it were a craze in me. I dare say it\xe2\x80\x99s a devil within me. But onlyyooa little one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. Butyoonot your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you\xe2\x80\x99re not a lodging worth havingyooeither. But I do believe\xe2\x80\x94I believe in God, though I have had doubts ofyoolate. But now I sit and await words of wisdom. I\xe2\x80\x99m like the philosopher,yooDiderot, your reverence. Did you ever hear, most Holy Fat'
12
b'erotyoowent to see the Metropolitan Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine?yooHe went in and said straight out, \xe2\x80\x98There is no God.\xe2\x80\x99 To which the greatyoobishop lifted up his finger and answered, \xe2\x80\x98The fool hath said in his heartyoothere is no God.\xe2\x80\x99 And he fell down at his feet on the spot. \xe2\x80\x98I believe,\xe2\x80\x99yoohe cried, \xe2\x80\x98and will be christened.\xe2\x80\x99 And so he was. Princess Dashkov wasyoohis godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.\xe2\x80\x9dyooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cFyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you\xe2\x80\x99re telling lies andyoothat that stupid anecdote isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. Why are you playing the fool?\xe2\x80\x9d criedyooMi\xc3\xbcsov in a shaking voice.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cI suspected all my life that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true,\xe2\x80\x9d Fyodor Pavlovitch criedyoowith conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen. Greatyooelder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s christening I made upyoojust now. I never thought of it before. I made it up to add piquancy. Iyooplay the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable.'
12
b'really don\xe2\x80\x99t know myself, sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot,yooI heard as far as \xe2\x80\x98the fool hath said in his heart\xe2\x80\x99 twenty times from theyoogentry about here when I was young. I heard your aunt, PyotryooAlexandrovitch, tell the story. They all believe to this day that theyooinfidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the MetropolitanyooPlaton....\xe2\x80\x9dyooyooMi\xc3\xbcsov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was furious, andyooconscious of being ridiculous.yooyooWhat was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty oryoofifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had enteredyoothat cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration. Almost every oneyooadmitted to the cell felt that a great favor was being shown him. Manyyooremained kneeling during the whole visit. Of those visitors, many had beenyoomen of high rank and learning, some even freethinkers, attracted byyoocuriosity, but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverenceyoo'
12
b', for here there was no question of money, but only, on theyooone side love and kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire toyoodecide some spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazedyooand bewildered the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, withyoounchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear what theyooelder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up, like Mi\xc3\xbcsov.yooAlyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears. What seemed toyoohim strangest of all was that his brother Ivan, on whom alone he hadyoorested his hopes, and who alone had such influence on his father that heyoocould have stopped him, sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes,yooapparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he hadyoonothing to do with it. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, theyoodivinity student, whom he knew almost intimately. He alone in theyoomonastery knew Rakitin\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts.yooyoo\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mi\xc3\xbcso'
