The History Of A FamilyyooyooyooyooChapter I. Fyodor Pavlovitch KaramazovyooyooyooAlexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor PavlovitchyooKaramazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, andyoostill remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, whichyoohappened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its properyooplace. For the present I will only say that this “landowner”—for so weyooused to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his ownyooestate—was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, ayootype abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one ofyoothose senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after theiryooworldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,yoofor instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest;yoohe ran to dine at other men’s tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yetyooat his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hardyoocash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless,yoofantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was notyoostupidity—the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd andyoointelligent enough—but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form ofyooit.yooyooHe was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his firstyoowife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor Pavlovitch’s firstyoowife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished nobleyoofamily, also landowners in our district, the Miüsovs. How it came to passyoothat an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of thoseyoovigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimesyooalso to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, punyyooweakling, as we all called him, I won’t attempt to explain. I knew a youngyoolady of the last “romantic” generation who after some years of anyooenigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily haveyoomarried at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, andyooended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapidyooriver from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely toyoosatisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare’s Ophelia. Indeed, ifyoothis precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been lessyoopicturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, mostyoolikely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, andyooprobably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two oryoothree generations. Adelaïda Ivanovna Miüsov’s action was similarly, noyoodoubt, an echo of other people’s ideas, and was due to the irritationyoocaused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show heryoofeminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism ofyooher family. And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, foryooa brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasiticyooposition, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressiveyooepoch, though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.yooWhat gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement,yooand this greatly captivated Adelaïda Ivanovna’s fancy. Fyodor Pavlovitch’syooposition at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise, foryoohe was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another. Toyooattach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluringyooprospect. As for mutual love it did not exist apparently, either in theyoobride or in him, in spite of Adelaïda Ivanovna’s beauty. This was,yooperhaps, a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, whoyoowas always of a voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat onyoothe slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman whoyoomade no particular appeal to his senses.yooyooImmediately after the elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna discerned in a flashyoothat she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriageyooaccordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity.yooAlthough the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned theyoorunaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to lead a mostyoodisorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between them. It wasyoosaid that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignityyoothan Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money upyooto twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that thoseyoothousands were lost to her for ever. The little village and the ratheryoofine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his utmost for ayoolong time to transfer to his name, by means of some deed of conveyance. Heyoowould probably have succeeded, merely from her moral fatigue and desire toyooget rid of him, and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by hisyoopersistent and shameless importunity. But, fortunately, AdelaïdayooIvanovna’s family intervened and circumvented his greediness. It is knownyoofor a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife,yoobut rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but wasyoobeaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatientyoowoman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally, she left theyoohouse and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinityyoostudent, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old, in her husband’syoohands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into theyoohouse, and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness. In the intervals heyooused to drive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and allyooof Adelaïda Ivanovna’s having left him, going into details too disgracefulyoofor a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed toyoogratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous partyooof the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.yooyoo“One would think that you’d got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you seemyooso pleased in spite of your sorrow,” scoffers said to him. Many even addedyoothat he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon, andyoothat it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware ofyoohis ludicrous position. But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. Atyoolast he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The pooryoowoman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinityyoostudent, and where she had thrown herself into a life of completeyooemancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, makingyoopreparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himselfyoohave said. He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to doyooso he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by anotheryoobout of reckless drinking. And just at that time his wife’s familyyooreceived the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenlyyooin a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version hadyooit, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife’syoodeath, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shoutingyoowith joy, raising his hands to Heaven: “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servantyoodepart in peace,” but others say he wept without restraint like a littleyoochild, so much so that people were sorry for him, in spite of theyoorepulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions were true,yoothat he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her whoyooreleased him. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much moreyoonaïve and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.yooyooyooyooChapter II. He Gets Rid Of His Eldest SonyooyooyooYou can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he wouldyoobring up his children. His behavior as a father was exactly what might beyooexpected. He completely abandoned the child of his marriage with AdelaïdayooIvanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial grievances, butyoosimply because he forgot him. While he was wearying every one with hisyootears and complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, ayoofaithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mityayoointo his care. If he hadn’t looked after him there would have been no oneyooeven to change the baby’s little shirt.yooyooIt happened moreover that the child’s relations on his mother’s sideyooforgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living, his widow,yooMitya’s grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill, while hisyoodaughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a whole year inyooold Grigory’s charge and lived with him in the servant’s cottage. But ifyoohis father had remembered him (he could not, indeed, have been altogetheryoounaware of his existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, asyoothe child would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But ayoocousin of Mitya’s mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, happened to returnyoofrom Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at thatyootime quite a young man, and distinguished among the Miüsovs as a man ofyooenlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been in the capitalsyooand abroad. Towards the end of his life he became a Liberal of the typeyoocommon in the forties and fifties. In the course of his career he had comeyoointo contact with many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both inyooRussia and abroad. He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and inyoohis declining years was very fond of describing the three days of theyooParis Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had almostyootaken part in the fighting on the barricades. This was one of the mostyoograteful recollections of his youth. He had an independent property ofyooabout a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. His splendid estateyoolay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of ouryoofamous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endlessyoolawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate, concerning the rightsyooof fishing in the river or wood-cutting in the forest, I don’t knowyooexactly which. He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man ofyooculture to open an attack upon the “clericals.” Hearing all about AdelaïdayooIvanovna, whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one timeyoobeen interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened, inyoospite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch.yooHe made the latter’s acquaintance for the first time, and told himyoodirectly that he wished to undertake the child’s education. He used longyooafterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he began to speakyooof Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did notyoounderstand what child he was talking about, and even as though he wasyoosurprised to hear that he had a little son in the house. The story mayyoohave been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing anyoounexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even toyoohis own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case. Thisyoohabit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, someyooof them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitchyoocarried the business through vigorously, and was appointed, with FyodoryooPavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a houseyooand land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into thisyoocousin’s keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and afteryoosecuring the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once toyooParis, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady living inyooMoscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in Paris he, too,yooforgot the child, especially when the Revolution of February broke out,yoomaking an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of hisyoolife. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya passed into the care of one of heryoomarried daughters. I believe he changed his home a fourth time later on. Iyoowon’t enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of FyodoryooPavlovitch’s firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essentialyoofacts about him, without which I could not begin my story.yooyooIn the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was theyooonly one of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s three sons who grew up in the belief thatyoohe had property, and that he would be independent on coming of age. Heyoospent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his studies at theyoogymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, wasyoopromoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotionyooagain, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money. He did not beginyooto receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, andyoountil then got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch,yoofor the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood onyoopurpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to have likedyoohis father. He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away,yoohaving only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into anyooagreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and valueyooof which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to getyooa statement from his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first timeyoothen (this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggeratedyooidea of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this,yooas it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the young manyoowas frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, andyoothat if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied, althoughyooonly, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to takeyooadvantage of this fact, sending him from time to time small doles,yooinstallments. In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience,yoocame a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with hisyoofather, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it wasyoodifficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value ofyoohis property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps evenyooin debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of his ownyoodesire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right to expectyooanything more, and so on, and so on. The young man was overwhelmed,yoosuspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself. And, indeed,yoothis circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms theyoosubject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it.yooBut before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch’syooother two sons, and of their origin.yooyooyooyooChapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second FamilyyooyooyooVery shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands FyodoryooPavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight years.yooHe took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, fromyooanother province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business inyoocompany with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a viciousyoodebauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and managed hisyoobusiness affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, notyooover-scrupulously. Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon,yooand was left from childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up inyoothe house of a general’s widow, a wealthy old lady of good position, whoyoowas at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not know the details, butyooI have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and gentle creature, wasyooonce cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in theyooloft, so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlastingyoonagging of this old woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but hadyoobecome an insufferable tyrant through idleness.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about him and heyoowas refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed an elopementyooto the orphan girl. There is very little doubt that she would not on anyyooaccount have married him if she had known a little more about him in time.yooBut she lived in another province; besides, what could a little girl ofyoosixteen know about it, except that she would be better at the bottom ofyoothe river than remaining with her benefactress. So the poor childyooexchanged a benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get ayoopenny this time, for the general’s widow was furious. She gave themyoonothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on a dowry; whatyooallured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl, above all heryooinnocent appearance, which had a peculiar attraction for a viciousyooprofligate, who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of feminineyoobeauty.yooyoo“Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,” he used to sayyooafterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this might,yooof course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had received noyoodowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her “from the halter,” heyoodid not stand on ceremony with her. Making her feel that she had “wronged”yoohim, he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness toyootrample on the elementary decencies of marriage. He gathered loose womenyoointo his house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife’syoopresence. To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention thatyooGrigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who hadyooalways hated his first mistress, Adelaïda Ivanovna, took the side of hisyoonew mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in ayoomanner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion broke up the revelsyooand drove all the disorderly women out of the house. In the end thisyoounhappy young woman, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into thatyookind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant womenyoowho are said to be “possessed by devils.” At times after terrible fits ofyoohysterics she even lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch twoyoosons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and theyoosecond three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourthyooyear, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother allyoohis life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the sameyoothing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya.yooThey were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They wereyoolooked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they wereyoofound by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She wasyoostill alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult doneyooher. All that time she was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya’syoomanner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings sheyoodeclared aloud two or three times to her retainers:yooyoo“It serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.”yooyooExactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna’s death the general’s widowyoosuddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch’syoohouse. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal.yooIt was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had not seen for those eightyooyears, came in to her drunk. The story is that instantly upon seeing him,yoowithout any sort of explanation, she gave him two good, resounding slapsyooon the face, seized him by a tuft of hair, and shook him three times upyooand down. Then, without a word, she went straight to the cottage to theyootwo boys. Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and inyoodirty linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, andyooannouncing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped themyoojust as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove off to heryooown town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted slave, without a word,yooand when he escorted the old lady to her carriage he made her a low bowyooand pronounced impressively that, “God would repay her for the orphans.”yoo“You are a blockhead all the same,” the old lady shouted to him as sheyoodrove away.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing, andyoodid not refuse the general’s widow his formal consent to any propositionyooin regard to his children’s education. As for the slaps she had given him,yoohe drove all over the town telling the story.yooyooIt happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left the boysyooin her will a thousand roubles each “for their instruction, and so thatyooall be spent on them exclusively, with the condition that it be soyooportioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for it is more thanyooadequate provision for such children. If other people think fit to throwyooaway their money, let them.” I have not read the will myself, but I heardyoothere was something queer of the sort, very whimsically expressed. Theyooprincipal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of theyooprovince, turned out, however, to be an honest man. Writing to FyodoryooPavlovitch, and discerning at once that he could extract nothing from himyoofor his children’s education (though the latter never directly refused butyooonly procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was, indeed, atyootimes effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a personal interestyooin the orphans. He became especially fond of the younger, Alexey, whoyoolived for a long while as one of his family. I beg the reader to note thisyoofrom the beginning. And to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity andyoohumanity rarely to be met with, the young people were more indebted foryootheir education and bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousandyooroubles left to them by the general’s widow intact, so that by the timeyoothey came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation ofyoointerest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly spentyoofar more than a thousand roubles upon each of them. I won’t enter into ayoodetailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a fewyooof the most important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that heyoogrew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy. Atyooten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own homeyoobut on other people’s charity, and that their father was a man of whom ityoowas disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his infancyyoo(so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude foryoolearning. I don’t know precisely why, but he left the family of YefimyooPetrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a Moscow gymnasium, andyooboarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher, an old friend ofyooYefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due toyoothe “ardor for good works” of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by theyooidea that the boy’s genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. Butyooneither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young manyoofinished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As Yefim Petrovitchyoohad made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old lady’s legacy,yoowhich had grown from one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing toyooformalities inevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straitsyoofor the first two years at the university, as he was forced to keepyoohimself all the time he was studying. It must be noted that he did notyooeven attempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, fromyoocontempt for him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told himyoothat from such a father he would get no real assistance. However that mayyoohave been, the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded inyoogetting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards gettingyooparagraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature ofyoo“Eye-Witness.” These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting andyoopiquant that they were soon taken. This alone showed the young man’syoopractical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy andyoounfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of theyoonewspapers and journals, unable to think of anything better thanyooeverlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French.yooHaving once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always keptyooup his connection with them, and in his latter years at the university heyoopublished brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, soyoothat he became well known in literary circles. But only in his last yearyoohe suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle ofyooreaders, so that a great many people noticed and remembered him. It wasyoorather a curious incident. When he had just left the university and wasyoopreparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitchyoopublished in one of the more important journals a strange article, whichyooattracted general notice, on a subject of which he might have beenyoosupposed to know nothing, as he was a student of natural science. Theyooarticle dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at theyootime—the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing severalyooopinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was mostyoostriking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion.yooMany of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side.yooAnd yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in theiryooapplause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article wasyoonothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incidentyooparticularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery inyooour neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in theyooquestion of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it.yooLearning the author’s name, they were interested in his being a native ofyoothe town and the son of “that Fyodor Pavlovitch.” And just then it wasyoothat the author himself made his appearance among us.yooyooWhy Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at theyootime with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the firstyoostep leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself.yooIt seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud,yooand apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous houseyooand a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, neveryoothought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given himyoomoney, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey wouldyooalso come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in theyoohouse of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and theyyoowere on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause ofyoowonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, ofyoowhom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s first wife,yoohappened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He hadyoocome from Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was moreyoosurprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man, whoyoointerested him extremely, and with whom he sometimes argued and notyoowithout an inner pang compared himself in acquirements.yooyoo“He is proud,” he used to say, “he will never be in want of pence; he hasyoogot money enough to go abroad now. What does he want here? Every one canyoosee that he hasn’t come for money, for his father would never give himyooany. He has no taste for drink and dissipation, and yet his father can’tyoodo without him. They get on so well together!”yooyooThat was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence over hisyoofather, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and evenyooseemed at times ready to obey his son, though often extremely and evenyoospitefully perverse.yooyooIt was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at the requestyooof, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri, whom he saw foryoothe first time on this very visit, though he had before leaving Moscowyoobeen in correspondence with him about an important matter of more concernyooto Dmitri than himself. What that business was the reader will learn fullyyooin due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance I stillyoofelt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visityoorather mysterious.yooyooI may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediatoryoobetween his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open quarrelyoowith his father and even planning to bring an action against him.yooyooThe family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of itsyoomembers met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother,yooAlexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of theyoothree to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult toyoospeak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account ofyoohim, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduceyoomy hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had beenyoofor the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to be cloisteredyoothere for the rest of his life.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. The Third Son, AlyoshayooyooyooHe was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth year at theyootime, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven. First of all, Iyoomust explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in myyooopinion at least, was not even a mystic. I may as well give my fullyooopinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, andyoothat he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time ityoostruck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling fromyoothe darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reasonyoothis life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, asyoohe thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to whomyoohe became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart. But Iyoodo not dispute that he was very strange even at that time, and had been soyooindeed from his cradle. I have mentioned already, by the way, that thoughyoohe lost his mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his life—heryooface, her caresses, “as though she stood living before me.” Such memoriesyoomay persist, as every one knows, from an even earlier age, even from twoyooyears old, but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spotsyooof light out of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, whichyoohas all faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it wasyoowith him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, theyooslanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most vividly of all);yooin a corner of the room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp, and onyooher knees before the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with cries andyoomoans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close till it hurt,yooand praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out in both arms toyoothe image as though to put him under the Mother’s protection ... andyoosuddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her in terror. That was theyoopicture! And Alyosha remembered his mother’s face at that minute. He usedyooto say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he rarelyyoocared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood and youth heyoowas by no means expansive, and talked little indeed, but not from shynessyooor a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from something different,yoofrom a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned withyooother people, but so important to him that he seemed, as it were, toyooforget others on account of it. But he was fond of people: he seemedyoothroughout his life to put implicit trust in people: yet no one everyoolooked on him as a simpleton or naïve person. There was something aboutyoohim which made one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards)yoothat he did not care to be a judge of others—that he would never take ityooupon himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything. Heyooseemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation thoughyoooften grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one couldyoosurprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth. Coming at twenty toyoohis father’s house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he, chasteyooand pure as he was, simply withdrew in silence when to look on wasyoounbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation.yooHis father, who had once been in a dependent position, and so wasyoosensitive and ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust andyoosullenness. “He does not say much,” he used to say, “and thinks the more.”yooBut soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and kissingyoohim terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality, yetyoohe evidently felt a real and deep affection for him, such as he had neveryoobeen capable of feeling for any one before.yooyooEvery one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and it was soyoofrom his earliest childhood. When he entered the household of his patronyooand benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he gained the hearts of all theyoofamily, so that they looked on him quite as their own child. Yet heyooentered the house at such a tender age that he could not have acted fromyoodesign nor artfulness in winning affection. So that the gift of makingyoohimself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him, in his veryyoonature, so to speak. It was the same at school, though he seemed to beyoojust one of those children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, andyooeven disliked by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, andyoorather solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping intoyooa corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he wasyooat school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see at theyoofirst glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the contrary he wasyoobright and good-tempered. He never tried to show off among hisyooschoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never afraid of any one,yooyet the boys immediately understood that he was not proud of hisyoofearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was bold and courageous. Heyoonever resented an insult. It would happen that an hour after the offenseyoohe would address the offender or answer some question with as trustful andyoocandid an expression as though nothing had happened between them. And ityoowas not that he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven theyooaffront, but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and thisyoocompletely conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristicyoowhich made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want toyoomock at him, not from malice but because it amused them. Thisyoocharacteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity. He could notyoobear to hear certain words and certain conversations about women. Thereyooare “certain” words and conversations unhappily impossible to eradicate inyooschools. Boys pure in mind and heart, almost children, are fond of talkingyooin school among themselves, and even aloud, of things, pictures, andyooimages of which even soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More thanyoothat, much that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar toyooquite young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is noyoomoral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is theyooappearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as somethingyoorefined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing that AlyoshayooKaramazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of “that,” theyyooused sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands away, and shoutyoonastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped to the floor, triedyooto hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring their insultsyooin silence. But at last they left him alone and gave up taunting him withyoobeing a “regular girl,” and what’s more they looked upon it withyoocompassion as a weakness. He was always one of the best in the class butyoowas never first.yooyooAt the time of Yefim Petrovitch’s death Alyosha had two more years toyoocomplete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable widow went almostyooimmediately after his death for a long visit to Italy with her wholeyoofamily, which consisted only of women and girls. Alyosha went to live inyoothe house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he hadyoonever seen before. On what terms he lived with them he did not knowyoohimself. It was very characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared atyoowhose expense he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast toyoohis elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two yearsyooin the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and had fromyoochildhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of hisyoobenefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha’s character must not, Iyoothink, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance withyoohim any one would have perceived that Alyosha was one of those youths,yooalmost of the type of religious enthusiast, who, if they were suddenly toyoocome into possession of a large fortune, would not hesitate to give ityooaway for the asking, either for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue.yooIn general he seemed scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course,yooin a literal sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never askedyoofor, he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in ayoomoment, or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.yooyooIn later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, a man very sensitive on theyooscore of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following judgment,yooafter getting to know Alyosha:yooyoo“Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave aloneyoowithout a penny, in the center of an unknown town of a millionyooinhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not die of cold andyoohunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once; and if he were not, heyoowould find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him no effort oryoohumiliation. And to shelter him would be no burden, but, on the contrary,yoowould probably be looked on as a pleasure.”yooyooHe did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before the end ofyoothe course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he was going to seeyoohis father about a plan which had occurred to him. They were sorry andyoounwilling to let him go. The journey was not an expensive one, and theyooladies would not let him pawn his watch, a parting present from hisyoobenefactor’s family. They provided him liberally with money and evenyoofitted him out with new clothes and linen. But he returned half the moneyyoothey gave him, saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrivalyooin the town he made no answer to his father’s first inquiry why he hadyoocome before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusuallyyoothoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his mother’syootomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that was the onlyyooobject of his visit. But it can hardly have been the whole reason of it.yooIt is more probable that he himself did not understand and could notyooexplain what had suddenly arisen in his soul, and drawn him irresistiblyyoointo a new, unknown, but inevitable path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not showyoohim where his second wife was buried, for he had never visited her graveyoosince he had thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years hadyooentirely forgotten where she was buried.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not beenyooliving in our town. Three or four years after his wife’s death he had goneyooto the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa, where he spentyooseveral years. He made the acquaintance at first, in his own words, “of ayoolot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,” and ended by being received byyoo“Jews high and low alike.” It may be presumed that at this period heyoodeveloped a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding money. He finallyyooreturned to our town only three years before Alyosha’s arrival. His formeryooacquaintances found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no meansyooan old man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with moreyooeffrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for makingyoobuffoons of others. His depravity with women was not simply what it usedyooto be, but even more revolting. In a short time he opened a great numberyooof new taverns in the district. It was evident that he had perhaps ayoohundred thousand roubles or not much less. Many of the inhabitants of theyootown and district were soon in his debt, and, of course, had given goodyoosecurity. Of late, too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed moreyooirresponsible, more uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used toyoobegin one thing and go on with another, as though he were letting himselfyoogo altogether. He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had notyoobeen for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged considerablyyootoo, and used to look after him sometimes almost like a tutor, FyodoryooPavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes. Alyosha’s arrival seemedyooto affect even his moral side, as though something had awakened in thisyooprematurely old man which had long been dead in his soul.yooyoo“Do you know,” he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, “that you areyoolike her, ‘the crazy woman’ ”—that was what he used to call his dead wife,yooAlyosha’s mother. Grigory it was who pointed out the “crazy woman’s” graveyooto Alyosha. He took him to our town cemetery and showed him in a remoteyoocorner a cast-iron tombstone, cheap but decently kept, on which wereyooinscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date of her death, andyoobelow a four-lined verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashionedyoomiddle-class tombs. To Alyosha’s amazement this tomb turned out to beyooGrigory’s doing. He had put it up on the poor “crazy woman’s” grave at hisyooown expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had often pestered about theyoograve, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the grave and all his memories.yooAlyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his mother’s grave.yooHe only listened to Grigory’s minute and solemn account of the erection ofyoothe tomb; he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering ayooword. It was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But thisyoolittle episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch—and ayoovery original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery toyoopay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for the second,yooAlyosha’s mother, the “crazy woman,” but for the first, Adelaïda Ivanovna,yoowho used to thrash him. In the evening of the same day he got drunk andyooabused the monks to Alyosha. He himself was far from being religious; heyoohad probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strangeyooimpulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.yooyooI have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance at thisyootime bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life heyoohad led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his little, always insolent,yoosuspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles inyoohis little fat face, the Adam’s apple hung below his sharp chin like ayoogreat, fleshy goiter, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive, sensualyooappearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips, betweenyoowhich could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth. He slobberedyooevery time he began to speak. He was fond indeed of making fun of his ownyooface, though, I believe, he was well satisfied with it. He usedyooparticularly to point to his nose, which was not very large, but veryyoodelicate and conspicuously aquiline. “A regular Roman nose,” he used toyoosay, “with my goiter I’ve quite the countenance of an ancient Romanyoopatrician of the decadent period.” He seemed proud of it.yooyooNot long after visiting his mother’s grave Alyosha suddenly announced thatyoohe wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks were willing toyooreceive him as a novice. He explained that this was his strong desire, andyoothat he was solemnly asking his consent as his father. The old man knewyoothat the elder Zossima, who was living in the monastery hermitage, hadyoomade a special impression upon his “gentle boy.”yooyoo“That is the most honest monk among them, of course,” he observed, afteryoolistening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming scarcely surprisedyooat his request. “H’m!... So that’s where you want to be, my gentle boy?”yooyooHe was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken grin,yoowhich was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness. “H’m!... I hadyooa presentiment that you would end in something like this. Would youyoobelieve it? You were making straight for it. Well, to be sure you haveyooyour own two thousand. That’s a dowry for you. And I’ll never desert you,yoomy angel. And I’ll pay what’s wanted for you there, if they ask for it.yooBut, of course, if they don’t ask, why should we worry them? What do youyoosay? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week. H’m!...yooDo you know that near one monastery there’s a place outside the town whereyooevery baby knows there are none but ‘the monks’ wives’ living, as they areyoocalled. Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You know, it’syoointeresting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it isyooit’s awfully Russian. There are no French women there. Of course theyyoocould get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hearyooof it they’ll come along. Well, there’s nothing of that sort here, noyoo‘monks’ wives,’ and two hundred monks. They’re honest. They keep theyoofasts. I admit it.... H’m.... So you want to be a monk? And do you knowyooI’m sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would you believe it, I’ve really grownyoofond of you? Well, it’s a good opportunity. You’ll pray for us sinners; weyoohave sinned too much here. I’ve always been thinking who would pray foryoome, and whether there’s any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I’myooawfully stupid about that. You wouldn’t believe it. Awfully. You see,yoohowever stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep thinking—from timeyooto time, of course, not all the while. It’s impossible, I think, for theyoodevils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die. ThenyooI wonder—hooks? Where would they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where doyoothey forge them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in theyoomonastery probably believe that there’s a ceiling in hell, for instance.yooNow I’m ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling. It makes it moreyoorefined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is. And, after all, whatyoodoes it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn’t? But, do you know,yoothere’s a damnable question involved in it? If there’s no ceiling thereyoocan be no hooks, and if there are no hooks it all breaks down, which isyoounlikely again, for then there would be none to drag me down to hell, andyooif they don’t drag me down what justice is there in the world? _Ilyoofaudrait les inventer_, those hooks, on purpose for me alone, for, if youyooonly knew, Alyosha, what a blackguard I am.”yooyoo“But there are no hooks there,” said Alyosha, looking gently and seriouslyyooat his father.yooyoo“Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That’s how ayooFrenchman described hell: ‘_J’ai bu l’ombre d’un cocher qui avec l’ombreyood’une brosse frottait l’ombre d’une carrosse._’ How do you know there areyoono hooks, darling? When you’ve lived with the monks you’ll sing ayoodifferent tune. But go and get at the truth there, and then come and tellyoome. Anyway it’s easier going to the other world if one knows what there isyoothere. Besides, it will be more seemly for you with the monks than hereyoowith me, with a drunken old man and young harlots ... though you’re likeyooan angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing will touch youyoothere. That’s why I let you go, because I hope for that. You’ve got allyooyour wits about you. You will burn and you will burn out; you will beyoohealed and come back again. And I will wait for you. I feel that you’reyoothe only creature in the world who has not condemned me. My dear boy, Iyoofeel it, you know. I can’t help feeling it.”yooyooAnd he even began blubbering. He was sentimental. He was wicked andyoosentimental.yooyooyooyooChapter V. EldersyooyooyooSome of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly, ecstatic,yoopoorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive dreamer. On the contrary,yooAlyosha was at this time a well-grown, red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad ofyoonineteen, radiant with health. He was very handsome, too, graceful,yoomoderately tall, with hair of a dark brown, with a regular, rather long,yoooval-shaped face, and wide-set dark gray, shining eyes; he was veryyoothoughtful, and apparently very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that redyoocheeks are not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancyyoothat Alyosha was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in theyoomonastery he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles areyoonever a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that disposeyoorealists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, willyooalways find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and ifyoohe is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would ratheryoodisbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he admits it, heyooadmits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith doesyoonot, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith.yooIf the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism toyooadmit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would notyoobelieve till he saw, but when he did see he said, “My Lord and my God!”yooWas it the miracle forced him to believe? Most likely not, but he believedyoosolely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in hisyoosecret heart even when he said, “I do not believe till I see.”yooyooI shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had notyoofinished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies isyootrue, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.yooI’ll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon this path onlyyoobecause, at that time, it alone struck his imagination and presentedyooitself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for his soul fromyoodarkness to light. Add to that that he was to some extent a youth of ouryoolast epoch—that is, honest in nature, desiring the truth, seeking for ityooand believing in it, and seeking to serve it at once with all the strengthyooof his soul, seeking for immediate action, and ready to sacrificeyooeverything, life itself, for it. Though these young men unhappily fail toyoounderstand that the sacrifice of life is, in many cases, the easiest ofyooall sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance, five or six years ofyootheir seething youth to hard and tedious study, if only to multiplyyootenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have setyoobefore them as their goal—such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strengthyooof many of them. The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the oppositeyoodirection, but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. Asyoosoon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of Godyooand immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: “I want toyoolive for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.” In the same way,yooif he had decided that God and immortality did not exist, he would at onceyoohave become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism is not merely theyoolabor question, it is before all things the atheistic question, theyooquestion of the form taken by atheism to-day, the question of the tower ofyooBabel built without God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set upyooheaven on earth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to goyooon living as before. It is written: “Give all that thou hast to the pooryooand follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect.”yooyooAlyosha said to himself: “I can’t give two roubles instead of ‘all,’ andyooonly go to mass instead of ‘following Him.’ ” Perhaps his memories ofyoochildhood brought back our monastery, to which his mother may have takenyoohim to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which hisyoopoor “crazy” mother had held him up still acted upon his imagination.yooBrooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps only to seeyoowhether here he could sacrifice all or only “two roubles,” and in theyoomonastery he met this elder. I must digress to explain what an “elder” isyooin Russian monasteries, and I am sorry that I do not feel very competentyooto do so. I will try, however, to give a superficial account of it in ayoofew words. Authorities on the subject assert that the institution ofyoo“elders” is of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in ouryoomonasteries, though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos,yooit has existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed inyooancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtookyooRussia—the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations with the Eastyooafter the destruction of Constantinople—this institution fell intoyoooblivion. It was revived among us towards the end of last century by oneyooof the great “ascetics,” as they called him, Païssy Velitchkovsky, and hisyoodisciples. But to this day it exists in few monasteries only, and hasyoosometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia. It flourishedyooespecially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it wasyoointroduced into our monastery I cannot say. There had already been threeyoosuch elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost dying ofyooweakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The questionyoofor our monastery was an important one, for it had not been distinguishedyooby anything in particular till then: they had neither relics of saints,yoonor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious traditions, nor historicalyooexploits. It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through itsyooelders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of milesyoofrom all parts.yooyooWhat was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul, your will,yoointo his soul and his will. When you choose an elder, you renounce youryooown will and yield it to him in complete submission, completeyooself-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, isyooundertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest, of self-mastery, inyooorder, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, fromyooself; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life withoutyoofinding their true selves in themselves. This institution of elders is notyoofounded on theory, but was established in the East from the practice of ayoothousand years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinaryyoo“obedience” which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. Theyooobligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submittedyoothemselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him and them.yooyooThe story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianityyooone such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon him by hisyooelder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt. There, after greatyooexploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a martyr’syoodeath for the faith. When the Church, regarding him as a saint, wasyooburying him, suddenly, at the deacon’s exhortation, “Depart all yeyoounbaptized,” the coffin containing the martyr’s body left its place andyoowas cast forth from the church, and this took place three times. And onlyyooat last they learnt that this holy man had broken his vow of obedience andyooleft his elder, and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder’syooabsolution in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeralyootake place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recentyooinstance.yooyooA monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos, which he lovedyooas a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go first to Jerusalem toyoodo homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the north to Siberia:yoo“There is the place for thee and not here.” The monk, overwhelmed withyoosorrow, went to the Œcumenical Patriarch at Constantinople and besoughtyoohim to release him from his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that notyooonly was he unable to release him, but there was not and could not be onyooearth a power which could release him except the elder who had himselfyoolaid that duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certainyoocases with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many ofyooour monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost toyoopersecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly esteemedyooamong the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well as men ofyoodistinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our monastery toyooconfess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings, and ask foryoocounsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of the elders declaredyoothat the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily and frivolouslyyoodegraded, though the continual opening of the heart to the elder by theyoomonk or the layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament. In theyooend, however, the institution of elders has been retained and is becomingyooestablished in Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that thisyooinstrument which had stood the test of a thousand years for the moralyooregeneration of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibilityyoomay be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility andyoocomplete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to bondageyooand not to freedom.yooyooThe elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners, hadyoobeen in the army in early youth, and served in the Caucasus as an officer.yooHe had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar quality of his soul.yooAlyosha lived in the cell of the elder, who was very fond of him and letyoohim wait upon him. It must be noted that Alyosha was bound by noyooobligation and could go where he pleased and be absent for whole days.yooThough he wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be differentyoofrom others. No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imaginationyoowas deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that soyoomany people had for years past come to confess their sins to FatheryooZossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing, that he hadyooacquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an unknown face what ayoonew-comer wanted, and what was the suffering on his conscience. Heyoosometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge ofyootheir secrets before they had spoken a word.yooyooAlyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the firstyootime with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happyyoofaces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima wasyoonot at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monksyooused to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and theyoogreater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to theyooend of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but theyyoowere few in number and they were silent, though among them were some ofyoogreat dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monksyoodistinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But theyoomajority were on Father Zossima’s side and very many of them loved himyoowith all their hearts, warmly and sincerely. Some were almost fanaticallyyoodevoted to him, and declared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint,yoothat there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near,yoothey anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in theyooimmediate future from his relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in theyoomiraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in theyoostory of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came withyoosick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them andyooto pray over them, return shortly after—some the next day—and, falling inyootears at the elder’s feet, thank him for healing their sick.yooyooWhether they had really been healed or were simply better in the naturalyoocourse of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, foryoohe fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced inyoohis fame, in his glory, as though it were his own triumph. His heartyoothrobbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over when the elder came out toyoothe gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd of pilgrims of theyoohumbler class who had flocked from all parts of Russia on purpose to seeyoothe elder and obtain his blessing. They fell down before him, wept, kissedyoohis feet, kissed the earth on which he stood, and wailed, while the womenyooheld up their children to him and brought him the sick “possessed withyoodevils.” The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessedyoothem, and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks ofyooillness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and the pilgrimsyoowaited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha did not wonder whyyoothey loved him so, why they fell down before him and wept with emotionyoomerely at seeing his face. Oh! he understood that for the humble soul ofyoothe Russian peasant, worn out by grief and toil, and still more by theyooeverlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world’s, it wasyoothe greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to fallyoodown before and worship.yooyoo“Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere onyooearth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the truth; he knows theyootruth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it will come one day to us,yootoo, and rule over all the earth according to the promise.”yooyooAlyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned. Heyoounderstood it, but that the elder Zossima was this saint and custodian ofyooGod’s truth—of that he had no more doubt than the weeping peasants and theyoosick women who held out their children to the elder. The conviction thatyooafter his death the elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monasteryyoowas even stronger in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kindyooof deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart.yooHe was not at all troubled at this elder’s standing as a solitary exampleyoobefore him.yooyoo“No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of renewal foryooall: that power which will, at last, establish truth on the earth, and allyoomen will be holy and love one another, and there will be no more rich noryoopoor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will be as the children of God, andyoothe true Kingdom of Christ will come.” That was the dream in Alyosha’syooheart.yooyooThe arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till then, seemedyooto make a great impression on Alyosha. He more quickly made friends withyoohis half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived later) than with his ownyoobrother Ivan. He was extremely interested in his brother Ivan, but whenyoothe latter had been two months in the town, though they had met fairlyyoooften, they were still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and heyooseemed to be expecting something, ashamed about something, while hisyoobrother Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long andyoocuriously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him. Alyoshayoonoticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his brother’s indifferenceyooat first to the disparity of their age and education. But he also wonderedyoowhether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to someyooother cause entirely unknown to him. He kept fancying that Ivan wasyooabsorbed in something—something inward and important—that he was strivingyootowards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why heyoohad no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not someyoocontempt on the part of the learned atheist for him—a foolish novice. Heyooknew for certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not takeyoooffense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassmentyoowhich he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to comeyoonearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect andyoowith a peculiar earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details ofyoothe important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkableyoobond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri’s enthusiastic references toyooIvan were the more striking in Alyosha’s eyes since Dmitri was, comparedyoowith Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast inyoopersonality and character that it would be difficult to find two men moreyoounlike.yooyooIt was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the membersyooof this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who hadyoosuch an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The pretext for this gatheringyoowas a false one. It was at this time that the discord between Dmitri andyoohis father seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had becomeyooinsufferably strained. Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first toyoosuggest, apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima’syoocell, and that, without appealing to his direct intervention, they mightyoomore decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence ofyoothe elder’s presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder, naturallyyoosupposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but, as he secretlyyooblamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father on severalyoorecent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It must be noted that he wasyoonot, like Ivan, staying with his father, but living apart at the other endyooof the town. It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, who was stayingyooin the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of theyooforties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on byyooboredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized withyoothe desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with theyoomonastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing theyooSuperior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming withyoosuch laudable intentions might be received with more attention andyooconsideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences fromyoowithin the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late hadyooscarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even hisyooordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day wasyoofixed.yooyoo“Who has made me a judge over them?” was all he said, smilingly, toyooAlyosha.yooyooAlyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all theyoowrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard theyoointerview seriously. All the others would come from frivolous motives,yooperhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan andyooMiüsov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while hisyoofather might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he saidyoonothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, wasyoofar from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the day withyooa heavy heart. No doubt he was always pondering in his mind how the familyyoodiscord could be ended. But his chief anxiety concerned the elder. Heyootrembled for him, for his glory, and dreaded any affront to him,yooespecially the refined, courteous irony of Miüsov and the superciliousyoohalf-utterances of the highly educated Ivan. He even wanted to venture onyoowarning the elder, telling him something about them, but, on secondyoothoughts, said nothing. He only sent word the day before, through ayoofriend, to his brother Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keepyoohis promise. Dmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he hadyoopromised, but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to letyoohimself be provoked “by vileness,” but that, although he had a deepyoorespect for the elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that theyoomeeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.yooyoo“Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking in respectyooto the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,” he wrote in conclusion.yooAlyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.yooyooyooyooyooBook II. An Unfortunate GatheringyooyooyooyooChapter I. They Arrive At The MonasteryyooyooyooIt was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview with theyooelder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately after late mass.yooOur visitors did not take part in the service, but arrived just as it wasyooover. First an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses, droveyooup with Miüsov and a distant relative of his, a young man of twenty,yoocalled Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This young man was preparing to enter theyoouniversity. Miüsov, with whom he was staying for the time, was trying toyoopersuade him to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena. The youngyooman was still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He wasyoonice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange fixityyooin his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he wouldyoosometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was silent and ratheryooawkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with any one, he becameyootalkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything or nothing. But hisyooanimation vanished as quickly as it appeared. He was always well and evenyooelaborately dressed; he had already some independent fortune andyooexpectations of much more. He was a friend of Alyosha’s.yooyooIn an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of oldyoopinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Miüsov’s carriage, came FyodoryooPavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though he had beenyooinformed of the time the evening before. The visitors left their carriageyooat the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of theyoomonastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had everyooseen the monastery, and Miüsov had probably not even been to church foryoothirty years. He looked about him with curiosity, together with assumedyooease. But, except the church and the domestic buildings, though these tooyoowere ordinary enough, he found nothing of interest in the interior of theyoomonastery. The last of the worshippers were coming out of the church,yoobareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler people were a few ofyoohigher rank—two or three ladies and a very old general. They were allyoostaying at the hotel. Our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars, butyoonone of them gave them anything, except young Kalganov, who took ayooten-copeck piece out of his purse, and, nervous and embarrassed—God knowsyoowhy!—hurriedly gave it to an old woman, saying: “Divide it equally.” Noneyooof his companions made any remark upon it, so that he had no reason to beyooembarrassed; but, perceiving this, he was even more overcome.yooyooIt was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that theyyoowere not received with special honor, though one of them had recently madeyooa donation of a thousand roubles, while another was a very wealthy andyoohighly cultured landowner, upon whom all in the monastery were in a senseyoodependent, as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put theiryoofishing rights in his hands. Yet no official personage met them.yooyooMiüsov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the church, and wasyooon the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a prettyyoopenny for the right of lying in this “holy place,” but refrained. Hisyooliberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.yooyoo“Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must find out,yoofor time is passing,” he observed suddenly, as though speaking to himself.yooyooAll at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiatingyoolittle eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting his hat, heyoointroduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a landowner of Tula. Heyooat once entered into our visitors’ difficulty.yooyoo“Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces from theyoomonastery, the other side of the copse.”yooyoo“I know it’s the other side of the copse,” observed Fyodor Pavlovitch,yoo“but we don’t remember the way. It is a long time since we’ve been here.”yooyoo“This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the copse. Comeyoowith me, won’t you? I’ll show you. I have to go.... I am going myself.yooThis way, this way.”yooyooThey came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov, a man ofyoosixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare at them all, withyooan incredible degree of nervous curiosity. His eyes looked starting out ofyoohis head.yooyoo“You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,” observedyooMiüsov severely. “That personage has granted us an audience, so to speak,yooand so, though we thank you for showing us the way, we cannot ask you toyooaccompany us.”yooyoo“I’ve been there. I’ve been already; _un chevalier parfait_,” and Maximovyoosnapped his fingers in the air.yooyoo“Who is a _chevalier_?” asked Miüsov.yooyoo“The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory of theyoomonastery, Zossima. Such an elder!”yooyooBut his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking monk ofyoomedium height, wearing a monk’s cap, who overtook them. Fyodor Pavlovitchyooand Miüsov stopped.yooyooThe monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:yooyoo“The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him afteryooyour visit to the hermitage. At one o’clock, not later. And you also,” heyooadded, addressing Maximov.yooyoo“That I certainly will, without fail,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, hugelyyoodelighted at the invitation. “And, believe me, we’ve all given our word toyoobehave properly here.... And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?”yooyoo“Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the customs here?yooThe only obstacle to me is your company....”yooyoo“Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet.”yooyoo“It would be a capital thing if he didn’t turn up. Do you suppose I likeyooall this business, and in your company, too? So we will come to dinner.yooThank the Father Superior,” he said to the monk.yooyoo“No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,” answered the monk.yooyoo“If so I’ll go straight to the Father Superior—to the Father Superior,”yoobabbled Maximov.yooyoo“The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please—” the monkyoohesitated.yooyoo“Impertinent old man!” Miüsov observed aloud, while Maximov ran back toyoothe monastery.yooyoo“He’s like von Sohn,” Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.yooyoo“Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von Sohn? Haveyooyou ever seen von Sohn?”yooyoo“I’ve seen his portrait. It’s not the features, but something indefinable.yooHe’s a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the physiognomy.”yooyoo“Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, FyodoryooPavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to behaveyooproperly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you beginyooto play the fool I don’t intend to be associated with you here.... You seeyoowhat a man he is”—he turned to the monk—“I’m afraid to go among decentyoopeople with him.” A fine smile, not without a certain slyness, came on toyoothe pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he made no reply, and wasyooevidently silent from a sense of his own dignity. Miüsov frowned more thanyooever.yooyoo“Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through centuries, andyoonothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,” flashed throughyooMiüsov’s mind.yooyoo“Here’s the hermitage. We’ve arrived,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. “The gatesyooare shut.”yooyooAnd he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted aboveyooand on the sides of the gates.yooyoo“When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this hermitageyoothere are twenty-five saints being saved. They look at one another, andyooeat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate. That’s what isyooremarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that the elder receivesyooladies,” he remarked suddenly to the monk.yooyoo“Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there waiting.yooBut for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining theyooportico, but outside the precincts—you can see the windows—and the elderyoogoes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough. They areyooalways outside the precincts. There is a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov,yoowaiting there now with her sick daughter. Probably he has promised to comeyooout to her, though of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shownyoohimself even to the people.”yooyoo“So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage toyoothe ladies. Don’t suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm. But do youyooknow that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed, but noyoocreature of the female sex—no hens, nor turkey-hens, nor cows.”yooyoo“Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you here. They’llyooturn you out when I’m gone.”yooyoo“But I’m not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,” he criedyoosuddenly, stepping within the precincts, “what a vale of roses they liveyooin!”yooyooThough there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and beautifulyooautumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them, and evidentlyyootended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds round the church, andyoobetween the tombs; and the one-storied wooden house where the elder livedyoowas also surrounded with flowers.yooyoo“And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy? He didn’tyoocare for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and thrash even ladiesyoowith a stick,” observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he went up the steps.yooyoo“The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a great dealyoothat’s told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,” answered the monk.yoo“Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I will announce you.”yooyoo“Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you hear? Behaveyooproperly or I will pay you out!” Miüsov had time to mutter again.yooyoo“I can’t think why you are so agitated,” Fyodor Pavlovitch observedyoosarcastically. “Are you uneasy about your sins? They say he can tell byyooone’s eyes what one has come about. And what a lot you think of theiryooopinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I’m surprised at you.”yooyooBut Miüsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were asked to comeyooin. He walked in, somewhat irritated.yooyoo“Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and begin toyooquarrel—and lower myself and my ideas,” he reflected.yooyooyooyooChapter II. The Old BuffoonyooyooyooThey entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came inyoofrom his bedroom. There were already in the cell, awaiting the elder, twoyoomonks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian, and the other FatheryooPaïssy, a very learned man, so they said, in delicate health, though notyooold. There was also a tall young man, who looked about two and twenty,yoostanding in the corner throughout the interview. He had a broad, freshyooface, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinaryyoodress. He was a divinity student, living under the protection of theyoomonastery. His expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting,yooreverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so not on anyooequality with the guests, he did not greet them with a bow.yooyooFather Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two monksyoorose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground with theiryoofingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder replied with asyoodeep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony wasyooperformed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like anyooeveryday rite. But Miüsov fancied that it was all done with intentionalyooimpressiveness. He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought—he hadyooreflected upon it the evening before—from simple politeness, since it wasyoothe custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder’s blessing, even ifyoohe did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing onyoothe part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignifiedyoogravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to ayoochair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Miüsov like an ape. Ivanyoobowed with great dignity and courtesy, but he too kept his hands at hisyoosides, while Kalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all. Theyooelder let fall the hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again,yooasked them all to sit down. The blood rushed to Alyosha’s cheeks. He wasyooashamed. His forebodings were coming true.yooyooFather Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa, coveredyoowith leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along the oppositeyoowall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black leather. The monksyoosat, one at the door and the other at the window. The divinity student,yoothe novice, and Alyosha remained standing. The cell was not very large andyoohad a faded look. It contained nothing but the most necessary furniture,yooof coarse and poor quality. There were two pots of flowers in the window,yooand a number of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikonyooof the Virgin a lamp was burning. Near it were two other holy pictures inyooshining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china eggs, a Catholicyoocross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it, and several foreignyooengravings from the great Italian artists of past centuries. Next to theseyoocostly and artistic engravings were several of the roughest Russian printsyooof saints and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all theyoofairs. On the other walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past andyoopresent.yooyooMiüsov took a cursory glance at all these “conventional” surroundings andyoobent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high opinion of his ownyooinsight, a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty, an age at which ayooclever man of the world of established position can hardly help takingyoohimself rather seriously. At the first moment he did not like Zossima.yooThere was, indeed, something in the elder’s face which many people besidesyooMiüsov might not have liked. He was a short, bent, little man, with veryyooweak legs, and though he was only sixty-five, he looked at least ten yearsyooolder. His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles,yooparticularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light-colored,yooquick, and shining like two bright points. He had a sprinkling of grayyoohair about his temples. His pointed beard was small and scanty, and hisyoolips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as two threads. His nose wasyoonot long, but sharp, like a bird’s beak.yooyoo“To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,” thoughtyooMiüsov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.yooyooA cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served toyoobegin the conversation.yooyoo“Precisely to our time,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, “but no sign of my son,yooDmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!” (Alyosha shuddered all over atyoo“sacred elder.”) “I am always punctual myself, minute for minute,yooremembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings....”yooyoo“But you are not a king, anyway,” Miüsov muttered, losing hisyooself-restraint at once.yooyoo“Yes; that’s true. I’m not a king, and, would you believe it, PyotryooAlexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I always say theyoowrong thing. Your reverence,” he cried, with sudden pathos, “you beholdyoobefore you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce myself as such. It’s an oldyoohabit, alas! And if I sometimes talk nonsense out of place it’s with anyooobject, with the object of amusing people and making myself agreeable. Oneyoomust be agreeable, mustn’t one? I was seven years ago in a little townyoowhere I had business, and I made friends with some merchants there. Weyoowent to the captain of police because we had to see him about something,yooand to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall, fat, fair, sulky man, theyoomost dangerous type in such cases. It’s their liver. I went straight up toyoohim, and with the ease of a man of the world, you know, ‘Mr. Ispravnik,’yoosaid I, ‘be our Napravnik.’ ‘What do you mean by Napravnik?’ said he. Iyoosaw, at the first half-second, that it had missed fire. He stood there soyooglum. ‘I wanted to make a joke,’ said I, ‘for the general diversion, asyooMr. Napravnik is our well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what weyooneed for the harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.’ And Iyooexplained my comparison very reasonably, didn’t I? ‘Excuse me,’ said he,yoo‘I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on my calling.’ Heyooturned and walked away. I followed him, shouting, ‘Yes, yes, you are anyooIspravnik, not a Napravnik.’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘since you called me ayooNapravnik I am one.’ And would you believe it, it ruined our business! AndyooI’m always like that, always like that. Always injuring myself with myyoopoliteness. Once, many years ago, I said to an influential person: ‘Youryoowife is a ticklish lady,’ in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities,yooso to speak. But he asked me, ‘Why, have you tickled her?’ I thought I’dyoobe polite, so I couldn’t help saying, ‘Yes,’ and he gave me a fineyootickling on the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I’m not ashamed toyootell the story. I’m always injuring myself like that.”yooyoo“You’re doing it now,” muttered Miüsov, with disgust.yooyooFather Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.yooyoo“Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, PyotryooAlexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as soon asyooI began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that you’d be the firstyooto remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn’t coming off, youryooreverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the loweryoojaw and there is almost a spasm in them. That’s been so since I was young,yoowhen I had to make jokes for my living in noblemen’s families. I am anyooinveterate buffoon, and have been from birth up, your reverence, it’s asyoothough it were a craze in me. I dare say it’s a devil within me. But onlyyooa little one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. Butyoonot your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you’re not a lodging worth havingyooeither. But I do believe—I believe in God, though I have had doubts ofyoolate. But now I sit and await words of wisdom. I’m like the philosopher,yooDiderot, your reverence. Did you ever hear, most Holy Father, how Diderotyoowent to see the Metropolitan Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine?yooHe went in and said straight out, ‘There is no God.’ To which the greatyoobishop lifted up his finger and answered, ‘The fool hath said in his heartyoothere is no God.’ And he fell down at his feet on the spot. ‘I believe,’yoohe cried, ‘and will be christened.’ And so he was. Princess Dashkov wasyoohis godmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.”yooyoo“Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you’re telling lies andyoothat that stupid anecdote isn’t true. Why are you playing the fool?” criedyooMiüsov in a shaking voice.yooyoo“I suspected all my life that it wasn’t true,” Fyodor Pavlovitch criedyoowith conviction. “But I’ll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen. Greatyooelder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot’s christening I made upyoojust now. I never thought of it before. I made it up to add piquancy. Iyooplay the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable. Though Iyooreally don’t know myself, sometimes, what I do it for. And as for Diderot,yooI heard as far as ‘the fool hath said in his heart’ twenty times from theyoogentry about here when I was young. I heard your aunt, PyotryooAlexandrovitch, tell the story. They all believe to this day that theyooinfidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the MetropolitanyooPlaton....”yooyooMiüsov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was furious, andyooconscious of being ridiculous.yooyooWhat was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty oryoofifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had enteredyoothat cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration. Almost every oneyooadmitted to the cell felt that a great favor was being shown him. Manyyooremained kneeling during the whole visit. Of those visitors, many had beenyoomen of high rank and learning, some even freethinkers, attracted byyoocuriosity, but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverenceyooand delicacy, for here there was no question of money, but only, on theyooone side love and kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire toyoodecide some spiritual problem or crisis. So that such buffoonery amazedyooand bewildered the spectators, or at least some of them. The monks, withyoounchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear what theyooelder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up, like Miüsov.yooAlyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears. What seemed toyoohim strangest of all was that his brother Ivan, on whom alone he hadyoorested his hopes, and who alone had such influence on his father that heyoocould have stopped him, sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes,yooapparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he hadyoonothing to do with it. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, theyoodivinity student, whom he knew almost intimately. He alone in theyoomonastery knew Rakitin’s thoughts.yooyoo“Forgive me,” began Miüsov, addressing Father Zossima, “for perhaps I seemyooto be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made a mistake in believingyoothat even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would understand what was due on ayoovisit to so honored a personage. I did not suppose I should have toyooapologize simply for having come with him....”yooyooPyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave the room,yoooverwhelmed with confusion.yooyoo“Don’t distress yourself, I beg.” The elder got on to his feeble legs, andyootaking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit down again. “I begyooyou not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg you to be my guest.” Andyoowith a bow he went back and sat down again on his little sofa.yooyoo“Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?” Fyodor Pavlovitchyoocried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both hands, as thoughyooready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.yooyoo“I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be uneasy,”yoothe elder said impressively. “Do not trouble. Make yourself quite at home.yooAnd, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the rootyooof it all.”yooyoo“Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too much, but Iyooaccept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed Father, you’d better notyooinvite me to be my natural self. Don’t risk it.... I will not go so far asyoothat myself. I warn you for your own sake. Well, the rest is still plungedyooin the mists of uncertainty, though there are people who’d be pleased toyoodescribe me for you. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as foryooyou, holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.”yooyooHe got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, “Blessed be the womb thatyoobare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck—the paps especially. When youyoosaid just now, ‘Don’t be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the rootyooof it all,’ you pierced right through me by that remark, and read me toyoothe core. Indeed, I always feel when I meet people that I am lower thanyooall, and that they all take me for a buffoon. So I say, ‘Let me reallyyooplay the buffoon. I am not afraid of your opinion, for you are every oneyooof you worse than I am.’ That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame,yoogreat elder, from shame; it’s simply over-sensitiveness that makes meyoorowdy. If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as theyookindest and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have beenyoothen! Teacher!” he fell suddenly on his knees, “what must I do to gainyooeternal life?”yooyooIt was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really moved.yooyooFather Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a smile:yooyoo“You have known for a long time what you must do. You have sense enough:yoodon’t give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech; don’t give wayyooto sensual lust; and, above all, to the love of money. And close youryootaverns. If you can’t close all, at least two or three. And, aboveyooall—don’t lie.”yooyoo“You mean about Diderot?”yooyoo“No, not about Diderot. Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who liesyooto himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannotyoodistinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respectyoofor himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love, andyooin order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way toyoopassions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, allyoofrom continual lying to other men and to himself. The man who lies toyoohimself can be more easily offended than any one. You know it is sometimesyoovery pleasant to take offense, isn’t it? A man may know that nobody hasyooinsulted him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has liedyooand exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made ayoomountain out of a molehill—he knows that himself, yet he will be the firstyooto take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he feels greatyoopleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness. But get up, sityoodown, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing....”yooyoo“Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.”yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elder’syoothin hand. “It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said that so well,yooas I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life taking offense,yooto please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds, for it is not soyoomuch pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted—that you hadyooforgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I shall make a note of that.yooBut I have been lying, lying positively my whole life long, every day andyoohour of it. Of a truth, I am a lie, and the father of lies. Though Iyoobelieve I am not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say,yoothe son of lies, and that will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I mayyoosometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes ayooword will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I hadyoobeen meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and toyoofind out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me.yooHere is my question: Is it true, great Father, that the story is toldyoosomewhere in the _Lives of the Saints_ of a holy saint martyred for hisyoofaith who, when his head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up hisyoohead, and, ‘courteously kissing it,’ walked a long way, carrying it in hisyoohands. Is that true or not, honored Father?”yooyoo“No, it is untrue,” said the elder.yooyoo“There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What saintyoodo you say the story is told of?” asked the Father Librarian.yooyoo“I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can’t tell. I was deceived.yooI was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who told it? PyotryooAlexandrovitch Miüsov here, who was so angry just now about Diderot. He ityoowas who told the story.”yooyoo“I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.”yooyoo“It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. Ityoowas three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story youyooshook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew nothing of it, but I wentyoohome with my faith shaken, and I have been getting more and more shakenyooever since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you were the cause of a great fall.yooThat was not a Diderot!”yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly clearyooto every one by now that he was playing a part again. Yet Miüsov was stungyooby his words.yooyoo“What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,” he muttered. “I may really haveyootold it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was told it myself. Iyooheard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me it was read at our massyoofrom the _Lives of the Saints_ ... he was a very learned man who had madeyooa special study of Russian statistics and had lived a long time inyooRussia.... I have not read the _Lives of the Saints_ myself, and I am notyoogoing to read them ... all sorts of things are said at dinner—we wereyoodining then.”yooyoo“Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!” said FyodoryooPavlovitch, mimicking him.yooyoo“What do I care for your faith?” Miüsov was on the point of shouting, butyoohe suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt, “You defileyooeverything you touch.”yooyooThe elder suddenly rose from his seat. “Excuse me, gentlemen, for leavingyooyou a few minutes,” he said, addressing all his guests. “I have visitorsyooawaiting me who arrived before you. But don’t you tell lies all the same,”yoohe added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch with a good-humored face. He wentyooout of the cell. Alyosha and the novice flew to escort him down the steps.yooAlyosha was breathless: he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too,yoothat the elder was good-humored and not offended. Father Zossima was goingyootowards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But FyodoryooPavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell.yooyoo“Blessed man!” he cried, with feeling. “Allow me to kiss your hand onceyoomore. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you thinkyooI always lie and play the fool like this? Believe me, I have been actingyoolike this all the time on purpose to try you. I have been testing you allyoothe time to see whether I could get on with you. Is there room for myyoohumility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a testimonial that oneyoocan get on with you! But now, I’ll be quiet; I will keep quiet all theyootime. I’ll sit in a chair and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak,yooPyotr Alexandrovitch. You are the principal person left now—for tenyoominutes.”yooyooyooyooChapter III. Peasant Women Who Have FaithyooyooyooNear the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the precinct,yoothere was a crowd of about twenty peasant women. They had been told thatyoothe elder was at last coming out, and they had gathered together inyooanticipation. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and her daughter, had also comeyooout into the portico to wait for the elder, but in a separate part of ityooset aside for women of rank.yooyooMadame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive, and alwaysyoodressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had lively black eyes. Sheyoowas not more than thirty-three, and had been five years a widow. Heryoodaughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially paralyzed. The poor child hadyoonot been able to walk for the last six months, and was wheeled about in ayoolong reclining chair. She had a charming little face, rather thin fromyooillness, but full of gayety. There was a gleam of mischief in her big darkyooeyes with their long lashes. Her mother had been intending to take heryooabroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the summer byyoobusiness connected with their estate. They had been staying a week in ouryootown, where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion, butyoohad visited Father Zossima once already, three days before. Though theyyooknew that the elder scarcely saw any one, they had now suddenly turned upyooagain, and urgently entreated “the happiness of looking once again on theyoogreat healer.”yooyooThe mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter’s invalidyoocarriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one of ouryoomonastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north.yooHe too sought the elder’s blessing.yooyooBut Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight to theyoopeasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up intoyoothe portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his stole, andyoobegan blessing the women who thronged about him. One crazy woman was ledyooup to him. As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shriekingyooand writhing as though in the pains of childbirth. Laying the stole on heryooforehead, he read a short prayer over her, and she was at once soothed andyooquieted.yooyooI do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened toyoosee and hear these “possessed” women in the villages and monasteries. Theyyooused to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so thatyoothey were heard all over the church. But when the sacrament was carried inyooand they were led up to it, at once the “possession” ceased, and the sickyoowomen were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazedyooat this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from myyootown teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and thatyooit could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were toldyooto confirm this. But later on I learnt with astonishment from medicalyoospecialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terribleyooillness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us inyooRussia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women. It is ayoodisease, I was told, arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard,yooabnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery,yoofrom beatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure likeyooothers. The strange and instant healing of the frantic and strugglingyoowoman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament, which had beenyooexplained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the “clericals,”yooarose probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supportedyooher and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question thatyoothe evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out if the sick womanyoowere brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it. And so, withyooa nervous and psychically deranged woman, a sort of convulsion of theyoowhole organism always took place, and was bound to take place, at theyoomoment of bowing down to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of theyoomiracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; andyooit did come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same nowyooas soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole.yooyooMany of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by theyooeffect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment, othersyoocried out in sing-song voices.yooyooHe blessed them all and talked with some of them. The “possessed” woman heyooknew already. She came from a village only six versts from the monastery,yooand had been brought to him before.yooyoo“But here is one from afar.” He pointed to a woman by no means old butyoovery thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackenedyooby exposure. She was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder;yoothere was something almost frenzied in her eyes.yooyoo“From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles from here.yooFrom afar off, Father, from afar off!” the woman began in a sing-songyoovoice as though she were chanting a dirge, swaying her head from side toyooside with her cheek resting in her hand.yooyooThere is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among theyoopeasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a griefyoothat breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds ventyooin wailing. This is particularly common with women. But it is no lighter ayoogrief than the silent. Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heartyoostill more. Such grief does not desire consolation. It feeds on the senseyooof its hopelessness. Lamentations spring only from the constant craving toyooreopen the wound.yooyoo“You are of the tradesman class?” said Father Zossima, looking curiouslyyooat her.yooyoo“Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though we live inyoothe town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard of you, Father, weyooheard of you. I have buried my little son, and I have come on ayoopilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but they told me, ‘Go,yooNastasya, go to them’—that is to you. I have come; I was yesterday at theyooservice, and to-day I have come to you.”yooyoo“What are you weeping for?”yooyoo“It’s my little son I’m grieving for, Father. He was three years old—threeyooyears all but three months. For my little boy, Father, I’m in anguish, foryoomy little boy. He was the last one left. We had four, my Nikita and I, andyoonow we’ve no children, our dear ones have all gone. I buried the firstyoothree without grieving overmuch, and now I have buried the last I can’tyooforget him. He seems always standing before me. He never leaves me. He hasyoowithered my heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, hisyoolittle boots, and I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all hisyoolittle things. I look at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, ‘Letyoome go on a pilgrimage, master.’ He is a driver. We’re not poor people,yooFather, not poor; he drives our own horse. It’s all our own, the horse andyoothe carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My Nikita has begunyoodrinking while I am away. He’s sure to. It used to be so before. As soonyooas I turn my back he gives way to it. But now I don’t think about him.yooIt’s three months since I left home. I’ve forgotten him. I’ve forgottenyooeverything. I don’t want to remember. And what would our life be nowyootogether? I’ve done with him, I’ve done. I’ve done with them all. I don’tyoocare to look upon my house and my goods. I don’t care to see anything atyooall!”yooyoo“Listen, mother,” said the elder. “Once in olden times a holy saint saw inyoothe Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one, her only one,yoowhom God had taken. ‘Knowest thou not,’ said the saint to her, ‘how boldyoothese little ones are before the throne of God? Verily there are noneyoobolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven. “Thou didst give us life, OyooLord,” they say, “and scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou didst takeyooit back again.” And so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives themyooat once the rank of angels. Therefore,’ said the saint, ‘thou, too, Oyoomother, rejoice and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in theyoofellowship of the angels.’ That’s what the saint said to the weepingyoomother of old. He was a great saint and he could not have spoken falsely.yooTherefore you too, mother, know that your little one is surely before theyoothrone of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying to God for you, andyootherefore weep not, but rejoice.”yooyooThe woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her hand. Sheyoosighed deeply.yooyoo“My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you. ‘Foolish one,’yoohe said, ‘why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with the angels beforeyooGod.’ He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I see that he cries likeyoome. ‘I know, Nikita,’ said I. ‘Where could he be if not with the Lord God?yooOnly, here with us now he is not as he used to sit beside us before.’ Andyooif only I could look upon him one little time, if only I could peep at himyooone little time, without going up to him, without speaking, if I could beyoohidden in a corner and only see him for one little minute, hear himyooplaying in the yard, calling in his little voice, ‘Mammy, where are you?’yooIf only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the roomyoojust once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he used to runyooto me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his little feet I shouldyooknow him! But he’s gone, Father, he’s gone, and I shall never hear himyooagain. Here’s his little sash, but him I shall never see or hear now.”yooyooShe drew out of her bosom her boy’s little embroidered sash, and as soonyooas she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her eyes with heryoofingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream.yooyoo“It is Rachel of old,” said the elder, “weeping for her children, and willyoonot be comforted because they are not. Such is the lot set on earth foryooyou mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation is not what you need. Weep andyoobe not consoled, but weep. Only every time that you weep be sure toyooremember that your little son is one of the angels of God, that he looksyoodown from there at you and sees you, and rejoices at your tears, andyoopoints at them to the Lord God; and a long while yet will you keep thatyoogreat mother’s grief. But it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and youryoobitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heartyooand delivers it from sin. And I shall pray for the peace of your child’syoosoul. What was his name?”yooyoo“Alexey, Father.”yooyoo“A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?”yooyoo“Yes, Father.”yooyoo“What a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your grief in myyooprayers, and I will pray for your husband’s health. It is a sin for you toyooleave him. Your little one will see from heaven that you have forsaken hisyoofather, and will weep over you. Why do you trouble his happiness? He isyooliving, for the soul lives for ever, and though he is not in the house heyoois near you, unseen. How can he go into the house when you say that theyoohouse is hateful to you? To whom is he to go if he find you not together,yoohis father and mother? He comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. Butyoothen he will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother; go thisyoovery day.”yooyoo“I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You’ve gone straight to myyooheart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for me,” the woman began in ayoosing-song voice; but the elder had already turned away to a very oldyoowoman, dressed like a dweller in the town, not like a pilgrim. Her eyesyooshowed that she had come with an object, and in order to say something.yooShe said she was the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived closeyooby in the town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and hadyoogone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from there, but now ayooyear had passed since he had written. She did inquire about him, but sheyoodid not know the proper place to inquire.yooyoo“Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna—she’s a rich merchant’s wife—saidyooto me, ‘You go, Prohorovna, and put your son’s name down for prayer in theyoochurch, and pray for the peace of his soul as though he were dead. Hisyoosoul will be troubled,’ she said, ‘and he will write you a letter.’ AndyooStepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been manyyootimes tried. Only I am in doubt.... Oh, you light of ours! is it true oryoofalse, and would it be right?”yooyoo“Don’t think of it. It’s shameful to ask the question. How is it possibleyooto pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own mother too! It’s ayoogreat sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you.yooBetter pray to the Queen of Heaven, our swift defense and help, for hisyoogood health, and that she may forgive you for your error. And anotheryoothing I will tell you, Prohorovna. Either he will soon come back to you,yooyour son, or he will be sure to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be inyoopeace. Your son is alive, I tell you.”yooyoo“Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for all of us andyoofor our sins!”yooyooBut the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes fixed uponyoohim. An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young peasant woman wasyoogazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought him, but she seemed afraid toyooapproach.yooyoo“What is it, my child?”yooyoo“Absolve my soul, Father,” she articulated softly, and slowly sank on heryooknees and bowed down at his feet. “I have sinned, Father. I am afraid ofyoomy sin.”yooyooThe elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer to him, stillyooon her knees.yooyoo“I am a widow these three years,” she began in a half-whisper, with a sortyooof shudder. “I had a hard life with my husband. He was an old man. He usedyooto beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought looking at him, if he were toyooget well, if he were to get up again, what then? And then the thought cameyooto me—”yooyoo“Stay!” said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.yooyooThe woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible toyoocatch anything. She had soon done.yooyoo“Three years ago?” asked the elder.yooyoo“Three years. At first I didn’t think about it, but now I’ve begun to beyooill, and the thought never leaves me.”yooyoo“Have you come from far?”yooyoo“Over three hundred miles away.”yooyoo“Have you told it in confession?”yooyoo“I have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it.”yooyoo“Have you been admitted to Communion?”yooyoo“Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die.”yooyoo“Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don’t fret. If only your penitenceyoofail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there can be no sinyooon all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to the truly repentant!yooMan cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of God.yooCan there be a sin which could exceed the love of God? Think only ofyoorepentance, continual repentance, but dismiss fear altogether. Believeyoothat God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with youryoosin, in your sin. It has been said of old that over one repentant sinneryoothere is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not.yooBe not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive theyoodead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled with him inyootruth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God. Allyoothings are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I, a sinner, evenyooas you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more willyooGod. Love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole worldyooby it, and expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others.”yooyooHe signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck a littleyooikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth without speaking.yooyooHe got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with a tinyyoobaby in her arms.yooyoo“From Vyshegorye, dear Father.”yooyoo“Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do you want?”yooyoo“I’ve come to look at you. I have been to you before—or have youyooforgotten? You’ve no great memory if you’ve forgotten me. They told us youyoowere ill. Thinks I, I’ll go and see him for myself. Now I see you, andyooyou’re not ill! You’ll live another twenty years. God bless you! There areyooplenty to pray for you; how should you be ill?”yooyoo“I thank you for all, daughter.”yooyoo“By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are sixtyyoocopecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me. I thought asyooI came along, better give through him. He’ll know whom to give to.”yooyoo“Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I will do soyoocertainly. Is that your little girl?”yooyoo“My little girl, Father, Lizaveta.”yooyoo“May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta! You haveyoogladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children, farewell, dear ones.”yooyooHe blessed them all and bowed low to them.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. A Lady Of Little FaithyooyooyooA visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the peasants andyoohis blessing them shed silent tears and wiped them away with heryoohandkerchief. She was a sentimental society lady of genuinely goodyoodisposition in many respects. When the elder went up to her at last sheyoomet him enthusiastically.yooyoo“Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...” Sheyoocould not go on for emotion. “Oh, I understand the people’s love for you.yooI love the people myself. I want to love them. And who could help lovingyoothem, our splendid Russian people, so simple in their greatness!”yooyoo“How is your daughter’s health? You wanted to talk to me again?”yooyoo“Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it! I wasyooready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your windows untilyooyou let me in. We have come, great healer, to express our ardentyoogratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her completely, merely byyoopraying over her last Thursday and laying your hands upon her. We haveyoohastened here to kiss those hands, to pour out our feelings and ouryoohomage.”yooyoo“What do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in her chair.”yooyoo“But her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,” said theyoolady with nervous haste. “And that’s not all. Her legs are stronger. Thisyoomorning she got up well; she had slept all night. Look at her rosy cheeks,yooher bright eyes! She used to be always crying, but now she laughs and isyoogay and happy. This morning she insisted on my letting her stand up, andyooshe stood up for a whole minute without any support. She wagers that in ayoofortnight she’ll be dancing a quadrille. I’ve called in DoctoryooHerzenstube. He shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘I am amazed; I can makeyoonothing of it.’ And would you have us not come here to disturb you, notyoofly here to thank you? Lise, thank him—thank him!”yooyooLise’s pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She rose inyooher chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder, clasped her handsyoobefore him, but could not restrain herself and broke into laughter.yooyoo“It’s at him,” she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation atyooherself for not being able to repress her mirth.yooyooIf any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the elder, heyoowould have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in an instant. Hisyooeyes shone and he looked down.yooyoo“She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are you?” the motheryoowent on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand to Alyosha.yooyooThe elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at Alyosha. Theyoolatter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely awkward way, heldyooout his hand to her too. Lise assumed an important air.yooyoo“Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.” She handed him a littleyoonote. “She particularly begs you to go and see her as soon as possible;yoothat you will not fail her, but will be sure to come.”yooyoo“She asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?” Alyosha muttered in greatyooastonishment. His face at once looked anxious. “Oh, it’s all to do withyooDmitri Fyodorovitch and—what has happened lately,” the mother explainedyoohurriedly. “Katerina Ivanovna has made up her mind, but she must see youyooabout it.... Why, of course, I can’t say. But she wants to see you atyooonce. And you will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty.”yooyoo“I have only seen her once,” Alyosha protested with the same perplexity.yooyoo“Oh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for heryoosuffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is enduring now!yooThink what awaits her! It’s all terrible, terrible!”yooyoo“Very well, I will come,” Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning theyoobrief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he wouldyoocome, without any sort of explanation.yooyoo“Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!” cried Lise with suddenyooanimation. “I told mamma you’d be sure not to go. I said you were savingyooyour soul. How splendid you are! I’ve always thought you were splendid.yooHow glad I am to tell you so!”yooyoo“Lise!” said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she had saidyooit.yooyoo“You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she said; “you neveryoocome to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is never happy exceptyoowith you.”yooyooAlyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again smiledyoowithout knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching him. He hadyoobegun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before, had been awaiting hisyooentrance by Lise’s chair. He was evidently a monk of the humblest, that isyooof the peasant, class, of a narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, inyoohis own way, a stubborn one. He announced that he had come from the faryoonorth, from Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a pooryoomonastery, consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessingyooand invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.yooyoo“How can you presume to do such deeds?” the monk asked suddenly, pointingyoosolemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring to her “healing.”yooyoo“It’s too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete cure,yooand may proceed from different causes. But if there has been any healing,yooit is by no power but God’s will. It’s all from God. Visit me, Father,” heyooadded to the monk. “It’s not often I can see visitors. I am ill, and Iyooknow that my days are numbered.”yooyoo“Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a long, longyootime yet,” cried the lady. “And in what way are you ill? You look so well,yooso gay and happy.”yooyoo“I am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that it’s only for ayoomoment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem so happy to you,yooyou could never say anything that would please me so much. For men areyoomade for happiness, and any one who is completely happy has a right to sayyooto himself, ‘I am doing God’s will on earth.’ All the righteous, all theyoosaints, all the holy martyrs were happy.”yooyoo“Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!” cried the lady. “You seemyooto pierce with your words. And yet—happiness, happiness—where is it? Whoyoocan say of himself that he is happy? Oh, since you have been so good as toyoolet us see you once more to-day, let me tell you what I could not utteryoolast time, what I dared not say, all I am suffering and have been for soyoolong! I am suffering! Forgive me! I am suffering!”yooyooAnd in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him.yooyoo“From what specially?”yooyoo“I suffer ... from lack of faith.”yooyoo“Lack of faith in God?”yooyoo“Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future life—it is suchyooan enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen! You are a healer, youyooare deeply versed in the human soul, and of course I dare not expect youyooto believe me entirely, but I assure you on my word of honor that I am notyoospeaking lightly now. The thought of the life beyond the grave distractsyoome to anguish, to terror. And I don’t know to whom to appeal, and have notyoodared to all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you. Oh, God! Whatyoowill you think of me now?”yooyooShe clasped her hands.yooyoo“Don’t distress yourself about my opinion of you,” said the elder. “Iyooquite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.”yooyoo“Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and ask myself ifyooevery one has faith, where did it come from? And then they do say that ityooall comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature, and that noneyooof it’s real. And I say to myself, ‘What if I’ve been believing all myyoolife, and when I come to die there’s nothing but the burdocks growing onyoomy grave?’ as I read in some author. It’s awful! How—how can I get back myyoofaith? But I only believed when I was a little child, mechanically,yoowithout thinking of anything. How, how is one to prove it? I have come nowyooto lay my soul before you and to ask you about it. If I let this chanceyooslip, no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it? How can Iyooconvince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand and look about me and seeyoothat scarcely any one else cares; no one troubles his head about it, andyooI’m the only one who can’t stand it. It’s deadly—deadly!”yooyoo“No doubt. But there’s no proving it, though you can be convinced of it.”yooyoo“How?”yooyoo“By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor activelyyooand indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer ofyoothe reality of God and of the immortality of your soul. If you attain toyooperfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor, then you willyoobelieve without doubt, and no doubt can possibly enter your soul. This hasyoobeen tried. This is certain.”yooyoo“In active love? There’s another question—and such a question! You see, Iyooso love humanity that—would you believe it?—I often dream of forsaking allyoothat I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister of mercy. I close my eyesyooand think and dream, and at that moment I feel full of strength toyooovercome all obstacles. No wounds, no festering sores could at that momentyoofrighten me. I would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I wouldyoonurse the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds.”yooyoo“It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams and notyooothers. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in reality.”yooyoo“Yes. But could I endure such a life for long?” the lady went onyoofervently, almost frantically. “That’s the chief question—that’s my mostyooagonizing question. I shut my eyes and ask myself, ‘Would you persevereyoolong on that path? And if the patient whose wounds you are washing did notyoomeet you with gratitude, but worried you with his whims, without valuingyooor remarking your charitable services, began abusing you and rudelyyoocommanding you, and complaining to the superior authorities of you (whichyoooften happens when people are in great suffering)—what then? Would youyoopersevere in your love, or not?’ And do you know, I came with horror toyoothe conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love to humanity, ityoowould be ingratitude. In short, I am a hired servant, I expect my paymentyooat once—that is, praise, and the repayment of love with love. Otherwise Iyooam incapable of loving any one.”yooyooShe was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding, sheyoolooked with defiant resolution at the elder.yooyoo“It’s just the same story as a doctor once told me,” observed the elder.yoo“He was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly clever. He spoke asyoofrankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest. ‘I love humanity,’ heyoosaid, ‘but I wonder at myself. The more I love humanity in general, theyooless I love man in particular. In my dreams,’ he said, ‘I have often comeyooto making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps Iyoomight actually have faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary;yooand yet I am incapable of living in the same room with any one for twoyoodays together, as I know by experience. As soon as any one is near me, hisyoopersonality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom. Inyootwenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because he’s tooyoolong over his dinner; another because he has a cold and keeps on blowingyoohis nose. I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. Butyooit has always happened that the more I detest men individually the moreyooardent becomes my love for humanity.’ ”yooyoo“But what’s to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must one despair?”yooyoo“No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you can, and ityoowill be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you since you can soyoodeeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have been talking to me soyoosincerely, simply to gain approbation for your frankness, as you did fromyoome just now, then of course you will not attain to anything in theyooachievement of real love; it will all get no further than dreams, and youryoowhole life will slip away like a phantom. In that case you will naturallyyoocease to think of the future life too, and will of yourself grow calmeryooafter a fashion in the end.”yooyoo“You have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand that I wasyooreally only seeking your approbation for my sincerity when I told you Iyoocould not endure ingratitude. You have revealed me to myself. You haveyooseen through me and explained me to myself!”yooyoo“Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession, I believeyoothat you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not attain happiness,yooalways remember that you are on the right road, and try not to leave it.yooAbove all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falsenessyooto yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it everyyoohour, every minute. Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself.yooWhat seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact ofyooyour observing it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only theyooconsequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your ownyoofaint-heartedness in attaining love. Don’t be frightened overmuch even atyooyour evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling to you, foryoolove in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.yooLove in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and inyoothe sight of all. Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal doesyoonot last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding asyoothough on the stage. But active love is labor and fortitude, and for someyoopeople too, perhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just when youyoosee with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting fartheryoofrom your goal instead of nearer to it—at that very moment I predict thatyooyou will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord whoyoohas been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you. Forgive me foryoonot being able to stay longer with you. They are waiting for me. Good-by.”yooyooThe lady was weeping.yooyoo“Lise, Lise! Bless her—bless her!” she cried, starting up suddenly.yooyoo“She does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness all along,”yoothe elder said jestingly. “Why have you been laughing at Alexey?”yooyooLise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time. She hadyoonoticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at her, and sheyoofound this extremely amusing. She waited intently to catch his eye.yooAlyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare, was irresistibly andyoosuddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once she smiled triumphantly inyoohis face. Alyosha was even more disconcerted and vexed. At last he turnedyooaway from her altogether and hid behind the elder’s back. After a fewyoominutes, drawn by the same irresistible force, he turned again to seeyoowhether he was being looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging outyooof her chair to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for him to look.yooCatching his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not help saying,yoo“Why do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?”yooyooLise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed. Her eyes flashed and heryooface became quite serious. She began speaking quickly and nervously in ayoowarm and resentful voice:yooyoo“Why has he forgotten everything, then? He used to carry me about when Iyoowas little. We used to play together. He used to come to teach me to read,yoodo you know. Two years ago, when he went away, he said that he would neveryooforget me, that we were friends for ever, for ever, for ever! And now he’syooafraid of me all at once. Am I going to eat him? Why doesn’t he want toyoocome near me? Why doesn’t he talk? Why won’t he come and see us? It’s notyoothat you won’t let him. We know that he goes everywhere. It’s not goodyoomanners for me to invite him. He ought to have thought of it first, if heyoohasn’t forgotten me. No, now he’s saving his soul! Why have you put thatyoolong gown on him? If he runs he’ll fall.”yooyooAnd suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresistible,yooprolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened to her with ayoosmile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed his hand she suddenlyyoopressed it to her eyes and began crying.yooyoo“Don’t be angry with me. I’m silly and good for nothing ... and perhapsyooAlyosha’s right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such ayooridiculous girl.”yooyoo“I will certainly send him,” said the elder.yooyooyooyooChapter V. So Be It! So Be It!yooyooyooThe elder’s absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty-fiveyoominutes. It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose accountyoothey had all met there, had still not appeared. But he seemed almost to beyooforgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he found his guestsyooengaged in eager conversation. Ivan and the two monks took the leadingyooshare in it. Miüsov, too, was trying to take a part, and apparently veryyooeagerly, in the conversation. But he was unsuccessful in this also. He wasyooevidently in the background, and his remarks were treated with neglect,yoowhich increased his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters withyooIvan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan showedyoohim.yooyoo“Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that isyooprogressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores us,”yoohe thought.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be quiet, hadyooactually been quiet for some time, but he watched his neighbor Miüsov withyooan ironical little smile, obviously enjoying his discomfiture. He had beenyoowaiting for some time to pay off old scores, and now he could not let theyooopportunity slip. Bending over his shoulder he began teasing him again inyooa whisper.yooyoo“Why didn’t you go away just now, after the ‘courteously kissing’? Why didyooyou consent to remain in such unseemly company? It was because you feltyooinsulted and aggrieved, and you remained to vindicate yourself by showingyoooff your intelligence. Now you won’t go till you’ve displayed youryoointellect to them.”yooyoo“You again?... On the contrary, I’m just going.”yooyoo“You’ll be the last, the last of all to go!” Fyodor Pavlovitch deliveredyoohim another thrust, almost at the moment of Father Zossima’s return.yooyooThe discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating himself inyoohis former place, looked at them all as though cordially inviting them toyoogo on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his face, saw that he wasyoofearfully exhausted and making a great effort. Of late he had been liableyooto fainting fits from exhaustion. His face had the pallor that was commonyoobefore such attacks, and his lips were white. But he evidently did notyoowant to break up the party. He seemed to have some special object of hisyooown in keeping them. What object? Alyosha watched him intently.yooyoo“We are discussing this gentleman’s most interesting article,” said FatheryooIosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan. “Heyoobrings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways.yooIt is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiasticalyooauthority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope ofyooits jurisdiction.”yooyoo“I’m sorry I have not read your article, but I’ve heard of it,” said theyooelder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.yooyoo“He takes up a most interesting position,” continued the Father Librarian.yoo“As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently quite opposedyooto the separation of Church from State.”yooyoo“That’s interesting. But in what sense?” Father Zossima asked Ivan.yooyooThe latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha hadyoofeared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill and apparentlyyoowithout the slightest _arrière-pensée_.yooyoo“I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is, ofyoothe essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on foryooever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle, andyoothat the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent or evenyoonormal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation of it.yooCompromise between the Church and State in such questions as, foryooinstance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible in any real sense.yooMy clerical opponent maintains that the Church holds a precise and definedyooposition in the State. I maintain, on the contrary, that the Church oughtyooto include the whole State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it, and,yooif this is, for some reason, impossible at present, then it ought, inyooreality, to be set up as the direct and chief aim of the futureyoodevelopment of Christian society!”yooyoo“Perfectly true,” Father Païssy, the silent and learned monk, assentedyoowith fervor and decision.yooyoo“The purest Ultramontanism!” cried Miüsov impatiently, crossing andyoorecrossing his legs.yooyoo“Oh, well, we have no mountains,” cried Father Iosif, and turning to theyooelder he continued: “Observe the answer he makes to the followingyoo‘fundamental and essential’ propositions of his opponent, who is, you mustyoonote, an ecclesiastic. First, that ‘no social organization can or ought toyooarrogate to itself power to dispose of the civic and political rights ofyooits members.’ Secondly, that ‘criminal and civil jurisdiction ought not toyoobelong to the Church, and is inconsistent with its nature, both as ayoodivine institution and as an organization of men for religious objects,’yooand, finally, in the third place, ‘the Church is a kingdom not of thisyooworld.’ ”yooyoo“A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!” Father Païssy couldyoonot refrain from breaking in again. “I have read the book which you haveyooanswered,” he added, addressing Ivan, “and was astounded at the words ‘theyooChurch is a kingdom not of this world.’ If it is not of this world, thenyooit cannot exist on earth at all. In the Gospel, the words ‘not of thisyooworld’ are not used in that sense. To play with such words isyooindefensible. Our Lord Jesus Christ came to set up the Church upon earth.yooThe Kingdom of Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; butyooit is only entered through the Church which has been founded andyooestablished upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in such ayooconnection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in truth, ayookingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly become theyookingdom ruling over all the earth. For that we have the divine promise.”yooyooHe ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After listeningyooattentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the elder withyooperfect composure and as before with ready cordiality:yooyoo“The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the firstyoothree centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church and wasyoonothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire desired to becomeyooChristian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming Christian, it includedyoothe Church but remained a pagan State in very many of its departments. Inyooreality this was bound to happen. But Rome as a State retained too much ofyoothe pagan civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objectsyooand fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church enteringyoointo the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamentalyooprinciples—the rock on which it stands—and could pursue no other aims thanyoothose which have been ordained and revealed by God Himself, and among themyoothat of drawing the whole world, and therefore the ancient pagan Stateyooitself, into the Church. In that way (that is, with a view to the future)yooit is not the Church that should seek a definite position in the State,yoolike ‘every social organization,’ or as ‘an organization of men foryooreligious purposes’ (as my opponent calls the Church), but, on theyoocontrary, every earthly State should be, in the end, completelyyootransformed into the Church and should become nothing else but a Church,yoorejecting every purpose incongruous with the aims of the Church. All thisyoowill not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory as a greatyooState, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it from a false,yoostill pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful path, which aloneyooleads to the eternal goal. This is why the author of the book _On theyooFoundations of Church Jurisdiction_ would have judged correctly if, inyooseeking and laying down those foundations, he had looked upon them as ayootemporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and imperfect days. But asyoosoon as the author ventures to declare that the foundations which heyoopredicates now, part of which Father Iosif just enumerated, are theyoopermanent, essential, and eternal foundations, he is going directlyyooagainst the Church and its sacred and eternal vocation. That is the gistyooof my article.”yooyoo“That is, in brief,” Father Païssy began again, laying stress on eachyooword, “according to certain theories only too clearly formulated in theyoonineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into the State, asyoothough this would be an advance from a lower to a higher form, so as toyoodisappear into it, making way for science, for the spirit of the age, andyoocivilization. And if the Church resists and is unwilling, some corner willyoobe set apart for her in the State, and even that under control—and thisyoowill be so everywhere in all modern European countries. But Russian hopesyooand conceptions demand not that the Church should pass as from a loweryoointo a higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the Stateyooshould end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else. Soyoobe it! So be it!”yooyoo“Well, I confess you’ve reassured me somewhat,” Miüsov said smiling, againyoocrossing his legs. “So far as I understand, then, the realization of suchyooan ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming of Christ. That’s asyooyou please. It’s a beautiful Utopian dream of the abolition of war,yoodiplomacy, banks, and so on—something after the fashion of socialism,yooindeed. But I imagined that it was all meant seriously, and that theyooChurch might be _now_ going to try criminals, and sentence them toyoobeating, prison, and even death.”yooyoo“But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church would notyooeven now sentence a criminal to prison or to death. Crime and the way ofyooregarding it would inevitably change, not all at once of course, butyoofairly soon,” Ivan replied calmly, without flinching.yooyoo“Are you serious?” Miüsov glanced keenly at him.yooyoo“If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all theyoocriminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,” Ivan wentyooon. “I ask you, what would become of the excluded? He would be cut offyoothen not only from men, as now, but from Christ. By his crime he wouldyoohave transgressed not only against men but against the Church of Christ.yooThis is so even now, of course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearlyyooenunciated, and very, very often the criminal of to-day compromises withyoohis conscience: ‘I steal,’ he says, ‘but I don’t go against the Church.yooI’m not an enemy of Christ.’ That’s what the criminal of to-day isyoocontinually saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of theyooState it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all overyoothe world, to say: ‘All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind areyoothe false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true ChristianyooChurch.’ It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it requires ayoorare combination of unusual circumstances. Now, on the other side, takeyoothe Church’s own view of crime: is it not bound to renounce the presentyooalmost pagan attitude, and to change from a mechanical cutting off of itsyootainted member for the preservation of society, as at present, intoyoocompletely and honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man,yooof his reformation and salvation?”yooyoo“What do you mean? I fail to understand again,” Miüsov interrupted. “Someyoosort of dream again. Something shapeless and even incomprehensible. Whatyoois excommunication? What sort of exclusion? I suspect you are simplyyooamusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.”yooyoo“Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now,” said the elder suddenly, andyooall turned to him at once. “If it were not for the Church of Christ thereyoowould be nothing to restrain the criminal from evil-doing, no realyoochastisement for it afterwards; none, that is, but the mechanicalyoopunishment spoken of just now, which in the majority of cases onlyyooembitters the heart; and not the real punishment, the only effectual one,yoothe only deterrent and softening one, which lies in the recognition of sinyooby conscience.”yooyoo“How is that, may one inquire?” asked Miüsov, with lively curiosity.yooyoo“Why,” began the elder, “all these sentences to exile with hard labor, andyooformerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what’s more, deter hardlyyooa single criminal, and the number of crimes does not diminish but isyoocontinually on the increase. You must admit that. Consequently theyoosecurity of society is not preserved, for, although the obnoxious memberyoois mechanically cut off and sent far away out of sight, another criminalyooalways comes to take his place at once, and often two of them. If anythingyoodoes preserve society, even in our time, and does regenerate and transformyoothe criminal, it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience. Ityoois only by recognizing his wrong-doing as a son of a Christianyoosociety—that is, of the Church—that he recognizes his sin againstyoosociety—that is, against the Church. So that it is only against theyooChurch, and not against the State, that the criminal of to-day canyoorecognize that he has sinned. If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction,yoothen it would know when to bring back from exclusion and to reunite toyooitself. Now the Church having no real jurisdiction, but only the power ofyoomoral condemnation, withdraws of her own accord from punishing theyoocriminal actively. She does not excommunicate him but simply persists inyoomotherly exhortation of him. What is more, the Church even tries toyoopreserve all Christian communion with the criminal. She admits him toyoochurch services, to the holy sacrament, gives him alms, and treats himyoomore as a captive than as a convict. And what would become of theyoocriminal, O Lord, if even the Christian society—that is, the Church—wereyooto reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off? Whatyoowould become of him if the Church punished him with her excommunication asyoothe direct consequence of the secular law? There could be no more terribleyoodespair, at least for a Russian criminal, for Russian criminals still haveyoofaith. Though, who knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen,yooperhaps the despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and thenyoowhat would become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving mother,yooholds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner is too severelyyoopunished already by the civil law, and there must be at least some one toyoohave pity on him. The Church holds aloof, above all, because its judgmentyoois the only one that contains the truth, and therefore cannot practicallyyooand morally be united to any other judgment even as a temporaryyoocompromise. She can enter into no compact about that. The foreignyoocriminal, they say, rarely repents, for the very doctrines of to-dayyooconfirm him in the idea that his crime is not a crime, but only a reactionyooagainst an unjustly oppressive force. Society cuts him off completely by ayooforce that triumphs over him mechanically and (so at least they say ofyoothemselves in Europe) accompanies this exclusion with hatred,yooforgetfulness, and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fateyooof the erring brother. In this way, it all takes place without theyoocompassionate intervention of the Church, for in many cases there are noyoochurches there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid churchyoobuildings remain, the churches themselves have long ago striven to passyoofrom Church into State and to disappear in it completely. So it seems atyooleast in Lutheran countries. As for Rome, it was proclaimed a Stateyooinstead of a Church a thousand years ago. And so the criminal is no longeryooconscious of being a member of the Church and sinks into despair. If heyooreturns to society, often it is with such hatred that society itselfyooinstinctively cuts him off. You can judge for yourself how it must end. Inyoomany cases it would seem to be the same with us, but the difference isyoothat besides the established law courts we have the Church too, whichyooalways keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still preciousyooson. And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought,yoothe judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice isyoostill living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctivelyyoorecognized by the criminal in his soul. What was said here just now isyootrue too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the Church were introducedyooin practice in its full force, that is, if the whole of the society wereyoochanged into the Church, not only the judgment of the Church would haveyooinfluence on the reformation of the criminal such as it never has now, butyoopossibly also the crimes themselves would be incredibly diminished. Andyoothere can be no doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and theyoocrime of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed inyoorestoring the excluded, in restraining those who plan evil, and inyooregenerating the fallen. It is true,” said Father Zossima, with a smile,yoo“the Christian society now is not ready and is only resting on some sevenyoorighteous men, but as they are never lacking, it will continue stillyoounshaken in expectation of its complete transformation from a societyyooalmost heathen in character into a single universal and all-powerfulyooChurch. So be it, so be it! Even though at the end of the ages, for it isyooordained to come to pass! And there is no need to be troubled about timesyooand seasons, for the secret of the times and seasons is in the wisdom ofyooGod, in His foresight, and His love. And what in human reckoning seemsyoostill afar off, may by the Divine ordinance be close at hand, on the eveyooof its appearance. And so be it, so be it!”yooyoo“So be it, so be it!” Father Païssy repeated austerely and reverently.yooyoo“Strange, extremely strange!” Miüsov pronounced, not so much with heat asyoowith latent indignation.yooyoo“What strikes you as so strange?” Father Iosif inquired cautiously.yooyoo“Why, it’s beyond anything!” cried Miüsov, suddenly breaking out; “theyooState is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position of the State.yooIt’s not simply Ultramontanism, it’s arch-Ultramontanism! It’s beyond theyoodreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!”yooyoo“You are completely misunderstanding it,” said Father Païssy sternly.yoo“Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the State. That isyooRome and its dream. That is the third temptation of the devil. On theyoocontrary, the State is transformed into the Church, will ascend and becomeyooa Church over the whole world—which is the complete opposite ofyooUltramontanism and Rome, and your interpretation, and is only the gloriousyoodestiny ordained for the Orthodox Church. This star will arise in theyooeast!”yooyooMiüsov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed extraordinaryyoopersonal dignity. A supercilious and condescending smile played on hisyoolips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing heart. The wholeyooconversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced casually at Rakitin, whoyoowas standing immovable in his place by the door listening and watchingyoointently though with downcast eyes. But from the color in his cheeksyooAlyosha guessed that Rakitin was probably no less excited, and he knewyoowhat caused his excitement.yooyoo“Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,” Miüsov saidyooimpressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. “Some years ago, soon afteryoothe _coup d’état_ of December, I happened to be calling in Paris on anyooextremely influential personage in the Government, and I met a veryyoointeresting man in his house. This individual was not precisely ayoodetective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment ofyoopolitical detectives—a rather powerful position in its own way. I wasyooprompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with him.yooAnd as he had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official bringingyooa special report, and as he saw the reception given me by his chief, heyoodeigned to speak with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course.yooHe was rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous,yooespecially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The subjectyoowas the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted. I willyooquote only one most curious remark dropped by this person. ‘We are notyooparticularly afraid,’ said he, ‘of all these socialists, anarchists,yooinfidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them and know all theiryoogoings on. But there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in Godyooand are Christians, but at the same time are socialists. These are theyoopeople we are most afraid of. They are dreadful people! The socialist whoyoois a Christian is more to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.’yooThe words struck me at the time, and now they have suddenly come back toyoome here, gentlemen.”yooyoo“You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?” Father Païssyyooasked directly, without beating about the bush.yooyooBut before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer, the dooryooopened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, came in. Theyyoohad, in fact, given up expecting him, and his sudden appearance causedyoosome surprise for a moment.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive?yooyooyooDmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium height andyooagreeable countenance, looked older than his years. He was muscular, andyooshowed signs of considerable physical strength. Yet there was somethingyoonot healthy in his face. It was rather thin, his cheeks were hollow, andyoothere was an unhealthy sallowness in their color. His rather large,yooprominent, dark eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yetyoothere was a vague look in them, too. Even when he was excited and talkingyooirritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayedyoosomething else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing. “It’syoohard to tell what he’s thinking,” those who talked to him sometimesyoodeclared. People who saw something pensive and sullen in his eyes wereyoostartled by his sudden laugh, which bore witness to mirthful andyoolight-hearted thoughts at the very time when his eyes were so gloomy. Ayoocertain strained look in his face was easy to understand at this moment.yooEvery one knew, or had heard of, the extremely restless and dissipatedyoolife which he had been leading of late, as well as of the violent anger toyoowhich he had been roused in his quarrels with his father. There wereyooseveral stories current in the town about it. It is true that he wasyooirascible by nature, “of an unstable and unbalanced mind,” as our justiceyooof the peace, Katchalnikov, happily described him.yooyooHe was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttonedyoofrock-coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top-hat. Having only latelyyooleft the army, he still had mustaches and no beard. His dark brown hairyoowas cropped short, and combed forward on his temples. He had the long,yoodetermined stride of a military man. He stood still for a moment on theyoothreshold, and glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder,yooguessing him to be their host. He made him a low bow, and asked hisyooblessing. Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed him. Dmitri kissedyoohis hand respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he said:yooyoo“Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so long, butyooSmerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to my inquiries, toldyoome twice over that the appointment was for one. Now I suddenly learn—”yooyoo“Don’t disturb yourself,” interposed the elder. “No matter. You are ayoolittle late. It’s of no consequence....”yooyoo“I’m extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your goodness.”yooyooSaying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly towards hisyoofather, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful bow. He hadyooevidently considered it beforehand, and made this bow in all seriousness,yoothinking it his duty to show his respect and good intentions.yooyooAlthough Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal to theyoooccasion. In response to Dmitri’s bow he jumped up from his chair and madeyoohis son a bow as low in return. His face was suddenly solemn andyooimpressive, which gave him a positively malignant look. Dmitri bowedyoogenerally to all present, and without a word walked to the window with hisyoolong, resolute stride, sat down on the only empty chair, near FatheryooPaïssy, and, bending forward, prepared to listen to the conversation heyoohad interrupted.yooyooDmitri’s entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the conversationyoowas resumed. But this time Miüsov thought it unnecessary to reply toyooFather Païssy’s persistent and almost irritable question.yooyoo“Allow me to withdraw from this discussion,” he observed with a certainyoowell-bred nonchalance. “It’s a subtle question, too. Here IvanyooFyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something interesting to sayyooabout that also. Ask him.”yooyoo“Nothing special, except one little remark,” Ivan replied at once.yoo“European Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often mixyooup the final results of socialism with those of Christianity. This wildyoonotion is, of course, a characteristic feature. But it’s not only Liberalsyooand dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity, but, in many cases,yooit appears, the police—the foreign police, of course—do the same. YouryooParis anecdote is rather to the point, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.”yooyoo“I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,” Miüsov repeated.yoo“I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting and ratheryoocharacteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself. Only five days ago,yooin a gathering here, principally of ladies, he solemnly declared inyooargument that there was nothing in the whole world to make men love theiryooneighbors. That there was no law of nature that man should love mankind,yooand that, if there had been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owingyooto a natural law, but simply because men have believed in immortality.yooIvan Fyodorovitch added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies inyoothat faith, and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief inyooimmortality, not only love but every living force maintaining the life ofyoothe world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing then would beyooimmoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism. That’s not all. Heyooended by asserting that for every individual, like ourselves, who does notyoobelieve in God or immortality, the moral law of nature must immediately beyoochanged into the exact contrary of the former religious law, and thatyooegoism, even to crime, must become not only lawful but even recognized asyoothe inevitable, the most rational, even honorable outcome of his position.yooFrom this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our eccentricyooand paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch’s theories.”yooyoo“Excuse me,” Dmitri cried suddenly; “if I’ve heard aright, crime must notyooonly be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable and the mostyoorational outcome of his position for every infidel! Is that so or not?”yooyoo“Quite so,” said Father Païssy.yooyoo“I’ll remember it.”yooyooHaving uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly as he hadyoobegun. Every one looked at him with curiosity.yooyoo“Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of theyoodisappearance of the faith in immortality?” the elder asked Ivan suddenly.yooyoo“Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is noyooimmortality.”yooyoo“You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.”yooyoo“Why unhappy?” Ivan asked smiling.yooyoo“Because, in all probability you don’t believe yourself in the immortalityyooof your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in your article onyooChurch jurisdiction.”yooyoo“Perhaps you are right! ... But I wasn’t altogether joking,” Ivan suddenlyyooand strangely confessed, flushing quickly.yooyoo“You were not altogether joking. That’s true. The question is stillyoofretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes sometimes toyoodivert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it by despairyooitself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself withyoomagazine articles, and discussions in society, though you don’t believeyooyour own arguments, and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly....yooThat question you have not answered, and it is your great grief, for ityooclamors for an answer.”yooyoo“But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative?” Ivan went onyooasking strangely, still looking at the elder with the same inexplicableyoosmile.yooyoo“If it can’t be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided inyoothe negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your heart, and allyooits suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who has given you ayoolofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking and seeking higheryoothings, for our dwelling is in the heavens. God grant that your heart willyooattain the answer on earth, and may God bless your path.”yooyooThe elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the cross overyooIvan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his seat, went up toyoohim, received his blessing, and kissing his hand went back to his place inyoosilence. His face looked firm and earnest. This action and all theyoopreceding conversation, which was so surprising from Ivan, impressed everyyooone by its strangeness and a certain solemnity, so that all were silentyoofor a moment, and there was a look almost of apprehension in Alyosha’syooface. But Miüsov suddenly shrugged his shoulders. And at the same momentyooFyodor Pavlovitch jumped up from his seat.yooyoo“Most pious and holy elder,” he cried, pointing to Ivan, “that is my son,yooflesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most dutiful KarlyooMoor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in, Dmitri, againstyoowhom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful Franz Moor—they areyooboth out of Schiller’s _Robbers_, and so I am the reigning Count von Moor!yooJudge and save us! We need not only your prayers but your prophecies!”yooyoo“Speak without buffoonery, and don’t begin by insulting the members ofyooyour family,” answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted voice. He wasyooobviously getting more and more fatigued, and his strength was failing.yooyoo“An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!” cried Dmitriyooindignantly. He too leapt up. “Forgive it, reverend Father,” he added,yooaddressing the elder. “I am not a cultivated man, and I don’t even knowyoohow to address you properly, but you have been deceived and you have beenyootoo good-natured in letting us meet here. All my father wants is ayooscandal. Why he wants it only he can tell. He always has some motive. ButyooI believe I know why—”yooyoo“They all blame me, all of them!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his turn.yoo“Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been blaming me, PyotryooAlexandrovitch, you have!” he turned suddenly to Miüsov, although theyoolatter was not dreaming of interrupting him. “They all accuse me of havingyoohidden the children’s money in my boots, and cheated them, but isn’t thereyooa court of law? There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,yoofrom your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money youyoohad, how much you have spent, and how much you have left. Why does PyotryooAlexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri is not a stranger to him.yooBecause they are all against me, while Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt toyoome, and not a little, but some thousands of which I have documentaryyooproof. The whole town is echoing with his debaucheries. And where he wasyoostationed before, he several times spent a thousand or two for theyooseduction of some respectable girl; we know all about that, DmitriyooFyodorovitch, in its most secret details. I’ll prove it.... Would youyoobelieve it, holy Father, he has captivated the heart of the most honorableyooof young ladies of good family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel,yooformerly his superior officer, who had received many honors and had theyooAnna Order on his breast. He compromised the girl by his promise ofyoomarriage, now she is an orphan and here; she is betrothed to him, yetyoobefore her very eyes he is dancing attendance on a certain enchantress.yooAnd although this enchantress has lived in, so to speak, civil marriageyoowith a respectable man, yet she is of an independent character, anyoounapproachable fortress for everybody, just like a legal wife—for she isyoovirtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she is virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants toyooopen this fortress with a golden key, and that’s why he is insolent to meyoonow, trying to get money from me, though he has wasted thousands on thisyooenchantress already. He’s continually borrowing money for the purpose.yooFrom whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya?”yooyoo“Be silent!” cried Dmitri, “wait till I’m gone. Don’t dare in my presenceyooto asperse the good name of an honorable girl! That you should utter ayooword about her is an outrage, and I won’t permit it!”yooyooHe was breathless.yooyoo“Mitya! Mitya!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing out ayootear. “And is your father’s blessing nothing to you? If I curse you, whatyoothen?”yooyoo“Shameless hypocrite!” exclaimed Dmitri furiously.yooyoo“He says that to his father! his father! What would he be with others?yooGentlemen, only fancy; there’s a poor but honorable man living here,yooburdened with a numerous family, a captain who got into trouble and wasyoodischarged from the army, but not publicly, not by court-martial, with noyooslur on his honor. And three weeks ago, Dmitri seized him by the beard inyooa tavern, dragged him out into the street and beat him publicly, and allyoobecause he is an agent in a little business of mine.”yooyoo“It’s all a lie! Outwardly it’s the truth, but inwardly a lie!” Dmitri wasyootrembling with rage. “Father, I don’t justify my action. Yes, I confess ityoopublicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and I regret it now, andyooI’m disgusted with myself for my brutal rage. But this captain, this agentyooof yours, went to that lady whom you call an enchantress, and suggested toyooher from you, that she should take I.O.U.’s of mine which were in youryoopossession, and should sue me for the money so as to get me into prison byyoomeans of them, if I persisted in claiming an account from you of myyooproperty. Now you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when youyooyourself incited her to captivate me! She told me so to my face.... Sheyootold me the story and laughed at you.... You wanted to put me in prisonyoobecause you are jealous of me with her, because you’d begun to force youryooattentions upon her; and I know all about that, too; she laughed at youyoofor that as well—you hear—she laughed at you as she described it. So hereyooyou have this man, this father who reproaches his profligate son!yooGentlemen, forgive my anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man wouldyooonly bring you together to create a scandal. I had come to forgive him ifyoohe held out his hand; to forgive him, and ask forgiveness! But as he hasyoojust this minute insulted not only me, but an honorable young lady, foryoowhom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name in vain, I haveyoomade up my mind to show up his game, though he is my father....”yooyooHe could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed withyoodifficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred. All except FatheryooZossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked austere butyoowaited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale, not fromyooexcitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring smile lighted upyoohis face; from time to time he raised his hand, as though to check theyoostorm, and, of course, a gesture from him would have been enough to endyoothe scene; but he seemed to be waiting for something and watched themyoointently as though trying to make out something which was not perfectlyyooclear to him. At last Miüsov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.yooyoo“We are all to blame for this scandalous scene,” he said hotly. “But I didyoonot foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom I had to deal. Thisyoomust be stopped at once! Believe me, your reverence, I had no preciseyooknowledge of the details that have just come to light, I was unwilling toyoobelieve them, and I learn for the first time.... A father is jealous ofyoohis son’s relations with a woman of loose behavior and intrigues with theyoocreature to get his son into prison! This is the company in which I haveyoobeen forced to be present! I was deceived. I declare to you all that I wasyooas much deceived as any one.”yooyoo“Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in an unnaturalyoovoice, “if you were not my son I would challenge you this instant to ayooduel ... with pistols, at three paces ... across a handkerchief,” heyooended, stamping with both feet.yooyooWith old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments whenyoothey enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tearsyooof emotion in earnest, although at that very moment, or a second later,yoothey are able to whisper to themselves, “You know you are lying, youyooshameless old sinner! You’re acting now, in spite of your ‘holy’ wrath.”yooyooDmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt at hisyoofather.yooyoo“I thought ... I thought,” he said, in a soft and, as it were, controlledyoovoice, “that I was coming to my native place with the angel of my heart,yoomy betrothed, to cherish his old age, and I find nothing but a depravedyooprofligate, a despicable clown!”yooyoo“A duel!” yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering at eachyoosyllable. “And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, let me tell you thatyoothere has never been in all your family a loftier, and more honest—youyoohear—more honest woman than this ‘creature,’ as you have dared to callyooher! And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have abandoned your betrothed for thatyoo‘creature,’ so you must yourself have thought that your betrothed couldn’tyoohold a candle to her. That’s the woman called a ‘creature’!”yooyoo“Shameful!” broke from Father Iosif.yooyoo“Shameful and disgraceful!” Kalganov, flushing crimson, cried in a boyishyoovoice, trembling with emotion. He had been silent till that moment.yooyoo“Why is such a man alive?” Dmitri, beside himself with rage, growled in ayoohollow voice, hunching up his shoulders till he looked almost deformed.yoo“Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling the earth?” He looked roundyooat every one and pointed at the old man. He spoke evenly and deliberately.yooyoo“Listen, listen, monks, to the parricide!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,yoorushing up to Father Iosif. “That’s the answer to your ‘shameful!’ What isyooshameful? That ‘creature,’ that ‘woman of loose behavior’ is perhapsyooholier than you are yourselves, you monks who are seeking salvation! Sheyoofell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her environment. But she loved much,yooand Christ himself forgave the woman ‘who loved much.’ ”yooyoo“It was not for such love Christ forgave her,” broke impatiently from theyoogentle Father Iosif.yooyoo“Yes, it was for such, monks, it was! You save your souls here, eatingyoocabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon a day, and youyoothink you bribe God with gudgeon.”yooyoo“This is unendurable!” was heard on all sides in the cell.yooyooBut this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way. FatheryooZossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost distracted with anxiety foryoothe elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however, in supportingyoohim by the arm. Father Zossima moved towards Dmitri and reaching him sankyooon his knees before him. Alyosha thought that he had fallen from weakness,yoobut this was not so. The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down atyooDmitri’s feet till his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was soyooastounded that he failed to assist him when he got up again. There was ayoofaint smile on his lips.yooyoo“Good-by! Forgive me, all of you!” he said, bowing on all sides to hisyooguests.yooyooDmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to him—what didyooit mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, “Oh, God!” hid his face in his hands,yooand rushed out of the room. All the guests flocked out after him, in theiryooconfusion not saying good-by, or bowing to their host. Only the monks wentyooup to him again for a blessing.yooyoo“What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic oryoowhat?” said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to reopenyooconversation without venturing to address anybody in particular. They wereyooall passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment.yooyoo“I can’t answer for a madhouse and for madmen,” Miüsov answered at onceyooill-humoredly, “but I will spare myself your company, Fyodor Pavlovitch,yooand, trust me, for ever. Where’s that monk?”yooyoo“That monk,” that is, the monk who had invited them to dine with theyooSuperior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as soon as they came downyoothe steps from the elder’s cell, as though he had been waiting for themyooall the time.yooyoo“Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor. Convey my deepest respect to theyooFather Superior, apologize for me, personally, Miüsov, to his reverence,yootelling him that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen circumstances Iyooam unable to have the honor of being present at his table, greatly as Iyooshould desire to do so,” Miüsov said irritably to the monk.yooyoo“And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself,” FyodoryooPavlovitch cut in immediately. “Do you hear, Father; this gentlemanyoodoesn’t want to remain in my company or else he’d come at once. And youyooshall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the Father Superior and goodyooappetite to you. I will decline, and not you. Home, home, I’ll eat atyoohome, I don’t feel equal to it here, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, my amiableyoorelative.”yooyoo“I am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible man!”yooyoo“I said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim theyoorelationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your shuffling.yooI’ll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan, stay if you like.yooI’ll send the horses for you later. Propriety requires you to go to theyooFather Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to apologize for the disturbanceyoowe’ve been making....”yooyoo“Is it true that you are going home? Aren’t you lying?”yooyoo“Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what’s happened! Forgive me,yoogentlemen, I was carried away! And upset besides! And, indeed, I amyooashamed. Gentlemen, one man has the heart of Alexander of Macedon andyooanother the heart of the little dog Fido. Mine is that of the little dogyooFido. I am ashamed! After such an escapade how can I go to dinner, toyoogobble up the monastery’s sauces? I am ashamed, I can’t. You must excuseyoome!”yooyoo“The devil only knows, what if he deceives us?” thought Miüsov, stillyoohesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful eyes. Theyoolatter turned round, and noticing that Miüsov was watching him, waved himyooa kiss.yooyoo“Well, are you coming to the Superior?” Miüsov asked Ivan abruptly.yooyoo“Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.”yooyoo“Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded dinner,”yoosaid Miüsov with the same irritability, regardless of the fact that theyoomonk was listening. “We ought, at least, to apologize for the disturbance,yooand explain that it was not our doing. What do you think?”yooyoo“Yes, we must explain that it wasn’t our doing. Besides, father won’t beyoothere,” observed Ivan.yooyoo“Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!”yooyooThey all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On the roadyoothrough the copse he made one observation however—that the Father Superioryoohad been waiting a long time, and that they were more than half an houryoolate. He received no answer. Miüsov looked with hatred at Ivan.yooyoo“Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,” heyoothought. “A brazen face, and the conscience of a Karamazov!”yooyooyooyooChapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A CareeryooyooyooAlyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated him on his bed. Ityoowas a little room furnished with the bare necessities. There was a narrowyooiron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a mattress. In the corner, underyoothe ikons, was a reading-desk with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. Theyooelder sank exhausted on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard.yooHe looked intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.yooyoo“Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you are neededyoothere, go and wait at the Father Superior’s table.”yooyoo“Let me stay here,” Alyosha entreated.yooyoo“You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will wait, and beyooof service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And remember, myyooson”—the elder liked to call him that—“this is not the place for you inyoothe future. When it is God’s will to call me, leave the monastery. Go awayyoofor good.”yooyooAlyosha started.yooyoo“What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you for greatyooservice in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage. And you will haveyooto take a wife, too. You will have to bear _all_ before you come back.yooThere will be much to do. But I don’t doubt of you, and so I send youyooforth. Christ is with you. Do not abandon Him and He will not abandon you.yooYou will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy. This isyoomy last message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly.yooRemember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not only myyoodays but my hours are numbered.”yooyooAlyosha’s face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his mouthyooquivered.yooyoo“What is it again?” Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. “The worldly mayyoofollow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the father who isyoodeparting. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me, I must pray. Go, andyoomake haste. Be near your brothers. And not near one only, but near both.”yooyooFather Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make noyooprotest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed, moreover, toyooask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question was on the tipyooof his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He knew that the elder would haveyooexplained it unasked if he had thought fit. But evidently it was not hisyoowill. That action had made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he believedyooblindly in its mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful.yooyooAs he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery inyootime to serve at the Father Superior’s dinner, he felt a sudden pang atyoohis heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossima’syoowords, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactlyyoomust infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But howyoocould he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearingyoohim? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave theyoomonastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. Heyoohurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage,yooand unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancientyoopines beside the path. He had not far to go—about five hundred paces. Heyooexpected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path heyoonoticed Rakitin. He was waiting for some one.yooyoo“Are you waiting for me?” asked Alyosha, overtaking him.yooyoo“Yes,” grinned Rakitin. “You are hurrying to the Father Superior, I know;yoohe has a banquet. There’s not been such a banquet since the Superioryooentertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you remember? I shan’t beyoothere, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell me one thing, Alexey, whatyoodoes that vision mean? That’s what I want to ask you.”yooyoo“What vision?”yooyoo“That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn’t he tap the ground withyoohis forehead, too!”yooyoo“You speak of Father Zossima?”yooyoo“Yes, of Father Zossima.”yooyoo“Tapped the ground?”yooyoo“Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what does thatyoovision mean?”yooyoo“I don’t know what it means, Misha.”yooyoo“I knew he wouldn’t explain it to you! There’s nothing wonderful about it,yooof course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an object in theyooperformance. All the pious people in the town will talk about it andyoospread the story through the province, wondering what it meant. To myyoothinking the old man really has a keen nose; he sniffed a crime. Youryoohouse stinks of it.”yooyoo“What crime?”yooyooRakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.yooyoo“It’ll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and your richyooold father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready for what may turnyooup. If something happens later on, it’ll be: ‘Ah, the holy man foresaw it,yooprophesied it!’ though it’s a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that.yoo‘Ah, but it was symbolic,’ they’ll say, ‘an allegory,’ and the devil knowsyoowhat all! It’ll be remembered to his glory: ‘He predicted the crime andyoomarked the criminal!’ That’s always the way with these crazy fanatics;yoothey cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple. Likeyooyour elder, he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of ayoomurderer.”yooyoo“What crime? What murderer? What do you mean?”yooyooAlyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.yooyoo“What murderer? As though you didn’t know! I’ll bet you’ve thought of ityoobefore. That’s interesting, too, by the way. Listen, Alyosha, you alwaysyoospeak the truth, though you’re always between two stools. Have you thoughtyooof it or not? Answer.”yooyoo“I have,” answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was taken aback.yooyoo“What? Have you really?” he cried.yooyoo“I ... I’ve not exactly thought it,” muttered Alyosha, “but directly youyoobegan speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought of it myself.”yooyoo“You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your father and youryoobrother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime. Then I’m not mistaken?”yooyoo“But wait, wait a minute,” Alyosha broke in uneasily. “What has led you toyoosee all this? Why does it interest you? That’s the first question.”yooyoo“Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I’ll deal with them separately.yooWhat led me to see it? I shouldn’t have seen it, if I hadn’t suddenlyyoounderstood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the very heart of him allyooat once. I caught the whole man from one trait. These very honest butyoopassionate people have a line which mustn’t be crossed. If it were, he’dyoorun at your father with a knife. But your father’s a drunken and abandonedyooold sinner, who can never draw the line—if they both let themselves go,yoothey’ll both come to grief.”yooyoo“No, Misha, no. If that’s all, you’ve reassured me. It won’t come toyoothat.”yooyoo“But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest, our Mityayoo(he is stupid, but honest), but he’s—a sensualist. That’s the veryyoodefinition and inner essence of him. It’s your father has handed him onyoohis low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder at you, Alyosha, how youyoocan have kept your purity. You’re a Karamazov too, you know! In youryoofamily sensuality is carried to a disease. But now, these threeyoosensualists are watching one another, with their knives in their belts.yooThe three of them are knocking their heads together, and you may be theyoofourth.”yooyoo“You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri—despises her,” said Alyosha,yoowith a sort of shudder.yooyoo“Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn’t despise her. Since he has openlyyooabandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn’t despise her. There’s somethingyoohere, my dear boy, that you don’t understand yet. A man will fall in loveyoowith some beauty, with a woman’s body, or even with a part of a woman’syoobody (a sensualist can understand that), and he’ll abandon his ownyoochildren for her, sell his father and mother, and his country, Russia,yootoo. If he’s honest, he’ll steal; if he’s humane, he’ll murder; if he’syoofaithful, he’ll deceive. Pushkin, the poet of women’s feet, sung of theiryoofeet in his verse. Others don’t sing their praises, but they can’t look atyootheir feet without a thrill—and it’s not only their feet. Contempt’s noyoohelp here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but heyoocan’t tear himself away.”yooyoo“I understand that,” Alyosha jerked out suddenly.yooyoo“Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it out at theyoofirst word,” said Rakitin, malignantly. “That escaped you unawares, andyoothe confession’s the more precious. So it’s a familiar subject; you’veyoothought about it already, about sensuality, I mean! Oh, you virgin soul!yooYou’re a quiet one, Alyosha, you’re a saint, I know, but the devil onlyyooknows what you’ve thought about, and what you know already! You are pure,yoobut you’ve been down into the depths.... I’ve been watching you a longyootime. You’re a Karamazov yourself; you’re a thorough Karamazov—no doubtyoobirth and selection have something to answer for. You’re a sensualist fromyooyour father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why do you tremble? Is ityootrue, then? Do you know, Grushenka has been begging me to bring you along.yoo‘I’ll pull off his cassock,’ she says. You can’t think how she keepsyoobegging me to bring you. I wondered why she took such an interest in you.yooDo you know, she’s an extraordinary woman, too!”yooyoo“Thank her and say I’m not coming,” said Alyosha, with a strained smile.yoo“Finish what you were saying, Misha. I’ll tell you my idea after.”yooyoo“There’s nothing to finish. It’s all clear. It’s the same old tune,yoobrother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,yooIvan? He’s a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you Karamazovs isyoothat you’re all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your brother Ivan writesyootheological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown motive of his own,yoothough he’s an atheist, and he admits it’s a fraud himself—that’s youryoobrother Ivan. He’s trying to get Mitya’s betrothed for himself, and Iyoofancy he’ll succeed, too. And what’s more, it’s with Mitya’s consent. ForyooMitya will surrender his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape toyooGrushenka. And he’s ready to do that in spite of all his nobility andyoodisinterestedness. Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who theyoodevil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on with it!yooLet me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing in Mitya’s wayyoonow. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka. His mouth waters at theyoosight of her. It’s simply on her account he made that scene in the cellyoojust now, simply because Miüsov called her an ‘abandoned creature.’ He’syooworse than a tom-cat in love. At first she was only employed by him inyooconnection with his taverns and in some other shady business, but now heyoohas suddenly realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keepsyoopestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And they’llyoocome into collision, the precious father and son, on that path! ButyooGrushenka favors neither of them, she’s still playing with them, andyooteasing them both, considering which she can get most out of. For thoughyooshe could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn’t marry her, andyoomaybe he’ll turn stingy in the end, and keep his purse shut. That’s whereyooMitya’s value comes in; he has no money, but he’s ready to marry her. Yes,yooready to marry her! to abandon his betrothed, a rare beauty, KaterinayooIvanovna, who’s rich, and the daughter of a colonel, and to marryyooGrushenka, who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant,yooSamsonov, a coarse, uneducated, provincial mayor. Some murderous conflictyoomay well come to pass from all this, and that’s what your brother Ivan isyoowaiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He’ll carry offyooKaterina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her dowry ofyoosixty thousand. That’s very alluring to start with, for a man of noyooconsequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won’t be wronging Mitya, butyoodoing him the greatest service. For I know as a fact that Mitya only lastyooweek, when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloudyoothat he was unworthy of his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan,yoohe was the man who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the endyoorefuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She’s hesitating between the two ofyoothem already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worshipyoohim? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.”yooyoo“How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?” Alyosha askedyoosharply, frowning.yooyoo“Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you knowyooI’m speaking the truth.”yooyoo“You don’t like Ivan. Ivan wouldn’t be tempted by money.”yooyoo“Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It’s not only the money,yoothough a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.”yooyoo“Ivan is above that. He wouldn’t make up to any one for thousands. It isyoonot money, it’s not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it’s suffering he isyooseeking.”yooyoo“What wild dream now? Oh, you—aristocrats!”yooyoo“Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He is hauntedyooby a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who don’t want millions,yoobut an answer to their questions.”yooyoo“That’s plagiarism, Alyosha. You’re quoting your elder’s phrases. Ah, Ivanyoohas set you a problem!” cried Rakitin, with undisguised malice. His faceyoochanged, and his lips twitched. “And the problem’s a stupid one. It is noyoogood guessing it. Rack your brains—you’ll understand it. His article isyooabsurd and ridiculous. And did you hear his stupid theory just now: ifyoothere’s no immortality of the soul, then there’s no virtue, and everythingyoois lawful. (And by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya criedyooout: ‘I will remember!’) An attractive theory for scoundrels!—(I’m beingyooabusive, that’s stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic _poseurs_,yoo‘haunted by profound, unsolved doubts.’ He’s showing off, and what it allyoocomes to is, ‘on the one hand we cannot but admit’ and ‘on the other ityoomust be confessed!’ His whole theory is a fraud! Humanity will find inyooitself the power to live for virtue even without believing in immortality.yooIt will find it in love for freedom, for equality, for fraternity.”yooyooRakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, asyoothough remembering something, he stopped short.yooyoo“Well, that’s enough,” he said, with a still more crooked smile. “Why areyooyou laughing? Do you think I’m a vulgar fool?”yooyoo“No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are clever but ...yoonever mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your getting hot about it,yooMisha. I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to KaterinayooIvanovna yourself; I’ve suspected that for a long time, brother, that’syoowhy you don’t like my brother Ivan. Are you jealous of him?”yooyoo“And jealous of her money, too? Won’t you add that?”yooyoo“I’ll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.”yooyoo“I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother Ivanyoowith you. Don’t you understand that one might very well dislike him, apartyoofrom Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil should I like him? Heyoocondescends to abuse me, you know. Why haven’t I a right to abuse him?”yooyoo“I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad. He doesn’tyoospeak of you at all.”yooyoo“But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna’s he wasyooabusing me for all he was worth—you see what an interest he takes in youryoohumble servant. And which is the jealous one after that, brother, I can’tyoosay. He was so good as to express the opinion that, if I don’t go in foryoothe career of an archimandrite in the immediate future and don’t become ayoomonk, I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and get on to some solidyoomagazine as a reviewer, that I shall write for the next ten years, and inyoothe end become the owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberalyooand atheistic side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss ofyoosocialism, but keeping a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping inyoowith both sides and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother’syooaccount, the tinge of socialism won’t hinder me from laying by theyooproceeds and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at theyooend of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move myyoopublishing offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He hasyooeven chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the Neva,yoowhich they say is to be built in Petersburg.”yooyoo“Ah, Misha, that’s just what will really happen, every word of it,” criedyooAlyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.yooyoo“You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.”yooyoo“No, no, I’m joking, forgive me. I’ve something quite different in myyoomind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You can’t have beenyooat Katerina Ivanovna’s yourself when he was talking about you?”yooyoo“I wasn’t there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him tell it withyoomy own ears; if you want to know, he didn’t tell me, but I overheard him,yoounintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in Grushenka’s bedroom and Iyoocouldn’t go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch was in the next room.”yooyoo“Oh, yes, I’d forgotten she was a relation of yours.”yooyoo“A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!” cried Rakitin, turningyoocrimson. “Are you mad? You’re out of your mind!”yooyoo“Why, isn’t she a relation of yours? I heard so.”yooyoo“Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being an ancient,yoonoble family, though your father used to run about playing the buffoon atyooother men’s tables, and was only admitted to the kitchen as a favor. I mayyoobe only a priest’s son, and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like you, butyoodon’t insult me so lightly and wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too,yooAlexey Fyodorovitch, I couldn’t be a relation of Grushenka, a commonyooharlot. I beg you to understand that!”yooyooRakitin was intensely irritated.yooyoo“Forgive me, for goodness’ sake, I had no idea ... besides ... how can youyoocall her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?” Alyosha flushedyoosuddenly. “I tell you again, I heard that she was a relation of yours. Youyoooften go to see her, and you told me yourself you’re not her lover. Iyoonever dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does sheyooreally deserve it?”yooyoo“I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That’s not your business.yooBut as for relationship, your brother, or even your father, is more likelyyooto make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. You’d better go to theyookitchen. Hullo! what’s wrong, what is it? Are we late? They can’t haveyoofinished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? Noyoodoubt they have. Here’s your father and your brother Ivan after him.yooThey’ve broken out from the Father Superior’s. And look, Father Isidor’syooshouting out something after them from the steps. And your father’syooshouting and waving his arms. I expect he’s swearing. Bah, and there goesyooMiüsov driving away in his carriage. You see, he’s going. And there’s oldyooMaximov running!—there must have been a row. There can’t have been anyyoodinner. Surely they’ve not been beating the Father Superior! Or have they,yooperhaps, been beaten? It would serve them right!”yooyooThere was reason for Rakitin’s exclamations. There had been a scandalous,yooan unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse of a moment.yooyooyooyooChapter VIII. The Scandalous SceneyooyooyooMiüsov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel some inwardyooqualms, when he reached the Father Superior’s with Ivan: he felt ashamedyooof having lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdained thatyoodespicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by himyooin Father Zossima’s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. “The monksyoowere not to blame, in any case,” he reflected, on the steps. “And ifyoothey’re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is ayoonobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won’t argue, I’llyoofall in with everything, I’ll win them by politeness, and ... and ... showyoothem that I’ve nothing to do with that Æsop, that buffoon, that Pierrot,yooand have merely been taken in over this affair, just as they have.”yooyooHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and relinquishyoohis claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once. He was the moreyooready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable, and heyoohad indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were.yooyooThese excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the FatheryooSuperior’s dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not ayoodining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether; theyyoowere, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima’s. Butyoothere was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either. Theyoofurniture was of mahogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionedyoostyle of 1820; the floor was not even stained, but everything was shiningyoowith cleanliness, and there were many choice flowers in the windows; theyoomost sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, theyoobeautifully decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; thereyoowere three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two ofyooexcellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas—both the latter made in theyoomonastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitinyoorelated afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup made ofyoosterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish served in ayoospecial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally,yooblanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he couldyoonot resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. Heyoohad a footing everywhere, and got information about everything. He was ofyooan uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerableyooabilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew heyoowould play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached toyoohim, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable, andyooquite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, thatyoobecause he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of theyoohighest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have influencedyoohim in that.yooyooRakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be invitedyooto the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Païssy, and one other monkyoowere the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were already waitingyoowhen Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood ayoolittle aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle ofyoothe room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorousyooold man, with black hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, asceticyooface. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approached toyooreceive his blessing. Miüsov even tried to kiss his hand, but the FatheryooSuperior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganovyoowent through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner,yookissing his hand as peasants do.yooyoo“We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,” began Miüsov, simperingyooaffably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone. “Pardon us foryoohaving come alone without the gentleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. Heyoofelt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitality, and not withoutyooreason. In the reverend Father Zossima’s cell he was carried away by theyoounhappy dissension with his son, and let fall words which were quite outyooof keeping ... in fact, quite unseemly ... as”—he glanced at theyoomonks—“your reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore,yoorecognizing that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame,yooand begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you hisyooapologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amendsyoolater. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has takenyooplace.”yooyooAs he uttered the last word of his tirade, Miüsov completely recovered hisyooself-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation disappeared. Heyoofully and sincerely loved humanity again.yooyooThe Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a slight bendyooof the head, replied:yooyoo“I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might haveyoolearnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.”yooyooHe stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bentyootheir heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, withyoopeculiar fervor.yooyooIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. Ityoomust be noted that he really had meant to go home, and really had felt theyooimpossibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothingyoohad happened, after his disgraceful behavior in the elder’s cell. Not thatyoohe was so very much ashamed of himself—quite the contrary perhaps. Butyoostill he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creakingyoocarriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he hadyoohardly got into it, when he suddenly stopped short. He remembered his ownyoowords at the elder’s: “I always feel when I meet people that I am loweryoothan all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me playyoothe buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.” Heyoolonged to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness. Heyoosuddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, “Why do you hateyooso and so, so much?” And he had answered them, with his shamelessyooimpudence, “I’ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him ayoodirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.”yooyooRemembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating for ayoomoment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered. “Well, since Iyoohave begun, I may as well go on,” he decided. His predominant sensation atyoothat moment might be expressed in the following words, “Well, there is noyoorehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worth. I willyooshow them I don’t care what they think—that’s all!”yooyooHe told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned to theyoomonastery and straight to the Father Superior’s. He had no clear idea whatyoohe would do, but he knew that he could not control himself, and that ayootouch might drive him to the utmost limits of obscenity, but only toyooobscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he could be legallyyoopunished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and hadyoomarveled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeared in theyooFather Superior’s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, andyooall were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned theyoocompany, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, lookedyoothem all boldly in the face. “They thought I had gone, and here I amyooagain,” he cried to the whole room.yooyooFor one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at once everyyooone felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively scandalous, wasyooabout to happen. Miüsov passed immediately from the most benevolent frameyooof mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and diedyoodown in his heart revived instantly.yooyoo“No! this I cannot endure!” he cried. “I absolutely cannot! and ... Iyoocertainly cannot!”yooyooThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyondyoothinking of style, and he seized his hat.yooyoo“What is it he cannot?” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, “that he absolutelyyoocannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Willyooyou receive me as your guest?”yooyoo“You are welcome with all my heart,” answered the Superior. “Gentlemen!”yoohe added, “I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside youryoodissensions, and to be united in love and family harmony—with prayer toyoothe Lord at our humble table.”yooyoo“No, no, it is impossible!” cried Miüsov, beside himself.yooyoo“Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible foryoome, and I won’t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with PyotryooAlexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch,yooI will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by whatyooyou said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is myyoorelation. That’s right, isn’t it, von Sohn? Here’s von Sohn. How are you,yoovon Sohn?”yooyoo“Do you mean me?” muttered Maximov, puzzled.yooyoo“Of course I mean you,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. “Who else? The FatheryooSuperior could not be von Sohn.”yooyoo“But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.”yooyoo“No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? Ityoowas a famous murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry—I believeyoothat is what such places are called among you—he was killed and robbed,yooand in spite of his venerable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent fromyooPetersburg to Moscow in the luggage van, and while they were nailing himyooup, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano.yooSo this is that very von Sohn. He has risen from the dead, hasn’t he, vonyooSohn?”yooyoo“What is happening? What’s this?” voices were heard in the group of monks.yooyoo“Let us go,” cried Miüsov, addressing Kalganov.yooyoo“No, excuse me,” Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepyoointo the room. “Allow me to finish. There in the cell you blamed me foryoobehaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, PyotryooAlexandrovitch. Miüsov, my relation, prefers to have _plus de noblesse queyoode sincérité_ in his words, but I prefer in mine _plus de sincérité que deyoonoblesse_, and—damn the _noblesse_! That’s right, isn’t it, von Sohn?yooAllow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yetyooI am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am the soul ofyoohonor, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothingyooelse. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son,yooAlexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, andyooit is my duty to care. While I’ve been playing the fool, I have beenyoolistening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give you theyoolast act of the performance. You know how things are with us? As a thingyoofalls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so it must lie for ever.yooNot a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignant withyooyou. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow downyooreverently; but there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud.yooCan it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers toyooconfess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so ityoowas of old. But how can I explain to him before every one that I did thisyooand that ... well, you understand what—sometimes it would not be proper toyootalk about it—so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carriedyooalong with you to the Flagellants, I dare say ... at the first opportunityyooI shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.”yooyooWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the weakyoospot. There had been at one time malicious rumors which had even reachedyoothe Archbishop (not only regarding our monastery, but in others where theyooinstitution of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to theyooelders, even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior, that theyooelders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on—absurdyoocharges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit ofyoofolly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him on theyoocurrent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy,yooprompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand ayooword of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion noyooone had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder’s cell, so that heyoocould not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking fromyooconfused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolishyootirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed toyooprove to his audience, and above all to himself, that he had not beenyootalking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectly well that with each wordyoohe would be adding more and more absurdity, he could not restrain himself,yooand plunged forward blindly.yooyoo“How disgraceful!” cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.yooyoo“Pardon me!” said the Father Superior. “It was said of old, ‘Many haveyoobegun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me. Andyoohearing it I have said to myself: it is the correction of the Lord and Heyoohas sent it to heal my vain soul.’ And so we humbly thank you, honoredyooguest!” and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.yooyoo“Tut—tut—tut—sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and oldyoogestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We know all about them. Ayookiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller’s _Robbers_. Iyoodon’t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the truth is not toyoobe found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why doyooyou fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for rewardyoolike that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try beingyoovirtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up inyooa monastery at other people’s expense, and without expecting a reward upyooaloft for it—you’ll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, FatheryooSuperior. What have they got here?” He went up to the table. “Old portyoowine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That isyoosomething beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have broughtyooout, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, theyoolaborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing ityoofrom his family and the tax-gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holyyoofathers.”yooyoo“This is too disgraceful!” said Father Iosif.yooyooFather Païssy kept obstinately silent. Miüsov rushed from the room, andyooKalganov after him.yooyoo“Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to seeyooyou again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan’t come. I sent you ayoothousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No,yooI’ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all theyoohumiliation I endured.” He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysmyooof simulated feeling. “This monastery has played a great part in my life!yooIt has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one,yooagainst me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about meyooall over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalism, theyooage of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred roubles,yoono, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!”yooyooIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great partyooin his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he wasyooso carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momentyooalmost believing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. Butyooat that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.yooyooThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spokeyooimpressively:yooyoo“It is written again, ‘Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that comethyooupon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him whoyoohath dishonored thee.’ And so will we.”yooyoo“Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethinkyooyourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away fromyoohere for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my mostyoodutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have youyooto stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is onlyyooone short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig andyookasha. We will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I’veyoocloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don’t lose your chance.” He went out,yooshouting and gesticulating.yooyooIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.yooyoo“Alexey!” his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him. “Youyoocome home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow and mattress, andyooleave no trace behind.”yooyooAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.yooMeanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan was aboutyooto follow him in grim silence without even turning to say good-by toyooAlyosha. But at this point another almost incredible scene of grotesqueyoobuffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode. Maximov suddenlyyooappeared by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of beingyootoo late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running. He was in such a hurry thatyooin his impatience he put his foot on the step on which Ivan’s left footyoowas still resting, and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in.yoo“I am going with you!” he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laughyoowith a look of reckless glee in his face. “Take me, too.”yooyoo“There!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. “Did I not say he was vonyooSohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tearyooyourself away? What did you _vonsohn_ there? And how could you get awayyoofrom the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, butyooI am surprised at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. Ityoowill be fun. He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet,yoovon Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the box, vonyooSohn!”yooyooBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov ayooviolent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chance heyoodid not fall.yooyoo“Drive on!” Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.yooyoo“Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you do that?” FyodoryooPavlovitch protested.yooyooBut the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.yooyoo“Well, you are a fellow,” Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.yooyooAfter a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, “Why, it was youyoogot up all this monastery business. You urged it, you approved of it. Whyyooare you angry now?”yooyoo“You’ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,” Ivan snappedyoosullenly.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.yooyoo“A drop of brandy would be nice now,” he observed sententiously, but Ivanyoomade no response.yooyoo“You shall have some, too, when we get home.”yooyooIvan was still silent.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.yooyoo“But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislikeyooit so much, most honored Karl von Moor.”yooyooIvan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at theyooroad. And they did not speak again all the way home.yooyooyooyooyooBook III. The SensualistsyooyooyooyooChapter I. In The Servants’ QuartersyooyooyooThe Karamazovs’ house was far from being in the center of the town, but ityoowas not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking old house of twoyoostories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was roomy and snug, andyoomight still last many years. There were all sorts of unexpected littleyoocupboards and closets and staircases. There were rats in it, but FyodoryooPavlovitch did not altogether dislike them. “One doesn’t feel so solitaryyoowhen one’s left alone in the evening,” he used to say. It was his habit toyoosend the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself upyooalone. The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. FyodoryooPavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although there was ayookitchen in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking, and, winteryooand summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard. Theyoohouse was built for a large family; there was room for five times as many,yoowith their servants. But at the time of our story there was no one livingyooin the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son Ivan. And in the lodgeyoothere were only three servants: old Grigory, and his old wife Marfa, and ayooyoung man called Smerdyakov. Of these three we must say a few words. Ofyooold Grigory we have said something already. He was firm and determined andyoowent blindly and obstinately for his object, if once he had been broughtyooby any reasons (and they were often very illogical ones) to believe thatyooit was immutably right. He was honest and incorruptible. His wife, MarfayooIgnatyevna, had obeyed her husband’s will implicitly all her life, yet sheyoohad pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs. She was setyooon leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow withyootheir small savings. But Grigory decided then, once for all, that “theyoowoman’s talking nonsense, for every woman is dishonest,” and that theyyooought not to leave their old master, whatever he might be, for “that wasyoonow their duty.”yooyoo“Do you understand what duty is?” he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.yooyoo“I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why it’s ouryooduty to stay here I never shall understand,” Marfa answered firmly.yooyoo“Well, don’t understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold youryootongue.”yooyooAnd so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch promised them ayoosmall sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory knew, too, that he hadyooan indisputable influence over his master. It was true, and he was awareyooof it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, thoughyoohis will was strong enough “in some of the affairs of life,” as heyooexpressed it, he found himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble inyoofacing certain other emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid ofyoothem. There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. Andyoothat’s not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a mostyootrustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor Pavlovitchyoohad only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory’s intervention,yooand on each occasion the old servant gave him a good lecture. But ityoowasn’t only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch was afraid of. There wereyoograver occasions, and very subtle and complicated ones, when FyodoryooPavlovitch could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some oneyoofaithful and devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in ayoomoment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often cruel in hisyoolust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes, inyoomoments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious terror and a moralyooconvulsion which took an almost physical form. “My soul’s simply quakingyooin my throat at those times,” he used to say. At such moments he liked toyoofeel that there was near at hand, in the lodge if not in the room, ayoostrong, faithful man, virtuous and unlike himself, who had seen all hisyoodebauchery and knew all his secrets, but was ready in his devotion toyoooverlook all that, not to oppose him, above all, not to reproach him oryoothreaten him with anything, either in this world or in the next, and, inyoocase of need, to defend him—from whom? From somebody unknown, but terribleyooand dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there was _another_ man, anyooold and tried friend, that he might call him in his sick moments merely toyoolook at his face, or, perhaps, exchange some quite irrelevant words withyoohim. And if the old servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if heyoowere angry, he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however)yoothat Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory andyoofetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch wouldyoobegin talking about the most trivial matters, and would soon let him goyooagain, sometimes even with a jest. And after he had gone, FyodoryooPavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of theyoojust. Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch onyooAlyosha’s arrival. Alyosha “pierced his heart” by “living with him, seeingyooeverything and blaming nothing.” Moreover, Alyosha brought with himyoosomething his father had never known before: a complete absence ofyoocontempt for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly naturalyoounaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this wasyooa complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all familyyooties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till thenyooloved nothing but “evil.” When Alyosha had left him, he confessed toyoohimself that he had learnt something he had not till then been willing toyoolearn.yooyooI have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaïda Ivanovna, theyoofirst wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of Dmitri, and that he had,yooon the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna, the poor “crazy woman,” againstyoohis master and any one who chanced to speak ill or lightly of her. Hisyoosympathy for the unhappy wife had become something sacred to him, so thatyooeven now, twenty years after, he could not bear a slighting allusion toyooher from any one, and would at once check the offender. Externally,yooGrigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his words,yoowithout frivolity. It was impossible to tell at first sight whether heyooloved his meek, obedient wife; but he really did love her, and she knewyooit.yooyooMarfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,yoocleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he in worldlyyooaffairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything without question oryoocomplaint ever since her marriage, and respected him for his spiritualyoosuperiority. It was remarkable how little they spoke to one another in theyoocourse of their lives, and only of the most necessary daily affairs. Theyoograve and dignified Grigory thought over all his cares and duties alone,yooso that Marfa Ignatyevna had long grown used to knowing that he did notyooneed her advice. She felt that her husband respected her silence, and tookyooit as a sign of her good sense. He had never beaten her but once, and thenyooonly slightly. Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch’s marriageyoowith Adelaïda Ivanovna, the village girls and women—at that timeyooserfs—were called together before the house to sing and dance. They wereyoobeginning “In the Green Meadows,” when Marfa, at that time a young woman,yooskipped forward and danced “the Russian Dance,” not in the villageyoofashion, but as she had danced it when she was a servant in the service ofyoothe rich Miüsov family, in their private theater, where the actors wereyootaught to dance by a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his wifeyoodanced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he gave her a lesson,yoopulling her hair a little. But there it ended: the beating was neveryoorepeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.yooyooGod had not blessed them with children. One child was born but it died.yooGrigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of showing it. WhenyooAdelaïda Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took Dmitri, then a child of threeyooyears old, combed his hair and washed him in a tub with his own hands, andyoolooked after him for almost a year. Afterwards he had looked after Ivanyooand Alyosha, for which the general’s widow had rewarded him with a slap inyoothe face; but I have already related all that. The only happiness his ownyoochild had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth. When ityoowas born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror. The baby had sixyoofingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was not only silent tillyoothe day of the christening, but kept away in the garden. It was spring,yooand he spent three days digging the kitchen garden. The third day wasyoofixed for christening the baby: mean-time Grigory had reached ayooconclusion. Going into the cottage where the clergy were assembled and theyoovisitors had arrived, including Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to standyoogod-father, he suddenly announced that the baby “ought not to beyoochristened at all.” He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out hisyoowords, and gazing with dull intentness at the priest.yooyoo“Why not?” asked the priest with good-humored surprise.yooyoo“Because it’s a dragon,” muttered Grigory.yooyoo“A dragon? What dragon?”yooyooGrigory did not speak for some time. “It’s a confusion of nature,” heyoomuttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to say more.yooyooThey laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory prayedyooearnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new-born child remainedyoounchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long as the sicklyyooinfant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to notice it, andyoofor the most part kept out of the cottage. But when, at the end of ayoofortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid the child in itsyoolittle coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when they were fillingyooup the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and bowed down to theyooearth. He did not for years afterwards mention his child, nor did Marfayoospeak of the baby before him, and, even if Grigory were not present, sheyoonever spoke of it above a whisper. Marfa observed that, from the day ofyoothe burial, he devoted himself to “religion,” and took to reading theyoo_Lives of the Saints_, for the most part sitting alone and in silence, andyooalways putting on his big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles. He rarely readyooaloud, only perhaps in Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and hadyoosomehow got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of “the God-fearingyooFather Isaac the Syrian,” which he read persistently for years together,yoounderstanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing and loving it theyoomore for that. Of late he had begun to listen to the doctrines of the sectyooof Flagellants settled in the neighborhood. He was evidently shaken byyoothem, but judged it unfitting to go over to the new faith. His habit ofyootheological reading gave him an expression of still greater gravity.yooyooHe was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his deformedyoochild, and its death, had, as though by special design, been accompaniedyooby another strange and marvelous event, which, as he said later, had leftyooa “stamp” upon his soul. It happened that, on the very night after theyooburial of his child, Marfa was awakened by the wail of a new-born baby.yooShe was frightened and waked her husband. He listened and said he thoughtyooit was more like some one groaning, “it might be a woman.” He got up andyoodressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, heyoodistinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from the yardyoointo the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way ofyooentering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Goingyooback into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, andyootaking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was stillyoopersuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her own babyyoocrying and calling for her, went into the garden in silence. There heyooheard at once that the groans came from the bath-house that stood near theyoogarden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman. Opening the door ofyoothe bath-house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, whoyoowandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nicknameyooof Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into theyoobath-house and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with theyoobaby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak.yooBut her story needs a chapter to itself.yooyooyooyooChapter II. LizavetayooyooyooThere was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, andyooconfirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This Lizaveta was ayoodwarfish creature, “not five foot within a wee bit,” as many of the piousyooold women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her broad,yoohealthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in heryooeyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She wanderedyooabout, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempenyoosmock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb’s wool, and formed ayoosort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and hadyooleaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept onyoothe ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard,yoocalled Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman withyoosome well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead. Spiteful andyoodiseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned toyoohim. But she rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to lookyooafter her as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God. Ilya’syooemployers, and many others in the town, especially of the tradespeople,yootried to clothe her better, and always rigged her out with high boots andyoosheepskin coat for the winter. But, although she allowed them to dress heryooup without resisting, she usually went away, preferably to the cathedralyooporch, and taking off all that had been given her—kerchief, sheepskin,yooskirt or boots—she left them there and walked away barefoot in her smockyooas before. It happened on one occasion that a new governor of theyooprovince, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw Lizaveta, and wasyoowounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And though he was told she wasyooan idiot, he pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander aboutyooin nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties, and must not occuryooagain. But the governor went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. Atyoolast her father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes ofyoothe religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one seemedyooto like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of our town,yooespecially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She would walk intoyoostrange houses, and no one drove her away. Every one was kind to her andyoogave her something. If she were given a copper, she would take it, and atyooonce drop it in the alms-jug of the church or prison. If she were given ayooroll or bun in the market, she would hand it to the first child she met.yooSometimes she would stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give ityooto her, and the lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tastedyooanything but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop,yoowhere there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept watch onyooher, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked byyoothem, she would not have touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went toyoochurch. She slept either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdleyoo(there are many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town) into ayookitchen garden. She used at least once a week to turn up “at home,” thatyoois at the house of her father’s former employers, and in the winter wentyoothere every night, and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse. Peopleyoowere amazed that she could stand such a life, but she was accustomed toyooit, and, although she was so tiny, she was of a robust constitution. Someyooof the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride, butyoothat is hardly credible. She could hardly speak, and only from time toyootime uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she have been proud?yooyooIt happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September (many years ago)yoofive or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a very lateyoohour, according to our provincial notions. They passed through theyoo“back-way,” which led between the back gardens of the houses, with hurdlesyooon either side. This way leads out on to the bridge over the long,yoostinking pool which we were accustomed to call a river. Among the nettlesyooand burdocks under the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. Theyyoostopped to look at her, laughing, and began jesting with unbridledyoolicentiousness. It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsicalyooinquiry whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as ayoowoman, and so forth.... They all pronounced with lofty repugnance that ityoowas impossible. But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was among them, sprang forwardyooand declared that it was by no means impossible, and that, indeed, thereyoowas a certain piquancy about it, and so on.... It is true that at thatyootime he was overdoing his part as a buffoon. He liked to put himselfyooforward and entertain the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course,yoothough in reality he was on a servile footing with them. It was just atyoothe time when he had received the news of his first wife’s death inyooPetersburg, and, with crape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving soyooshamelessly that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sightyooof him. The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; andyooone of them even began challenging him to act upon it. The others repelledyoothe idea even more emphatically, although still with the utmost hilarity,yooand at last they went on their way. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch swore thatyoohe had gone with them, and perhaps it was so, no one knows for certain,yooand no one ever knew. But five or six months later, all the town wasyootalking, with intense and sincere indignation, of Lizaveta’s condition,yooand trying to find out who was the miscreant who had wronged her. Thenyoosuddenly a terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was noyooother than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going? Of that drunkenyooband five had left the town and the only one still among us was an elderlyyooand much respected civil councilor, the father of grown-up daughters, whoyoocould hardly have spread the tale, even if there had been any foundationyoofor it. But rumor pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted inyoopointing at him. Of course this was no great grievance to him: he wouldyoonot have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople. In those days heyoowas proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle of theyooofficials and nobles, whom he entertained so well.yooyooAt the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He provokedyooquarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded in bringing someyoopeople round to his side. “It’s the wench’s own fault,” he asserted, andyoothe culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict, who had escaped from prison andyoowhose name was well known to us, as he had hidden in our town. Thisyooconjecture sounded plausible, for it was remembered that Karp had been inyoothe neighborhood just at that time in the autumn, and had robbed threeyoopeople. But this affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popularyoosympathy from the poor idiot. She was better looked after than ever. Ayoowell-to-do merchant’s widow named Kondratyev arranged to take her into heryoohouse at the end of April, meaning not to let her go out until after theyooconfinement. They kept a constant watch over her, but in spite of theiryoovigilance she escaped on the very last day, and made her way into FyodoryooPavlovitch’s garden. How, in her condition, she managed to climb over theyoohigh, strong fence remained a mystery. Some maintained that she must haveyoobeen lifted over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. Theyoomost likely explanation is that it happened naturally—that Lizaveta,yooaccustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehowyoomanaged to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had leaptyoodown, injuring herself.yooyooGrigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch anyooold midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died atyoodawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sityoodown, put it on her lap. “A child of God—an orphan is akin to all,” heyoosaid, “and to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, whoyoohas come from the devil’s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep noyoomore.”yooyooSo Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which peopleyoowere not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitchyoodid not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persistedyoovigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased atyoohis adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surnameyoofor the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother’s nickname.yooyooSo this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch’s second servant, and wasyooliving in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins.yooHe was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, butyooI am ashamed of keeping my readers’ attention so long occupied with theseyoocommon menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more ofyooSmerdyakov in the course of it.yooyooyooyooChapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart—In VerseyooyooyooAlyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command hisyoofather shouted to him from the carriage. But in spite of his uneasiness heyoodid not stand still. That was not his way. He went at once to the kitchenyooto find out what his father had been doing above. Then he set off,yootrusting that on the way he would find some answer to the doubt tormentingyoohim. I hasten to add that his father’s shouts, commanding him to returnyoohome “with his mattress and pillow” did not frighten him in the least. Heyoounderstood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely “a flourish”yooto produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in our town who wasyoocelebrating his name-day with a party of friends, getting angry at beingyoorefused more vodka, smashed up his own crockery and furniture and tore hisyooown and his wife’s clothes, and finally broke his windows, all for theyoosake of effect. Next day, of course, when he was sober, he regretted theyoobroken cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him goyooback to the monastery next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, heyoowas fully persuaded that his father might hurt any one else, but would notyoohurt him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever wouldyoowant to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him.yooThis was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and heyoowent his way without hesitation, relying on it.yooyooBut at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him, andyooworried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was the fear ofyooa woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him in theyoonote handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to come and see her about something.yooThis request and the necessity of going had at once aroused an uneasyyoofeeling in his heart, and this feeling had grown more and more painful allyoothe morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage and at the FatheryooSuperior’s. He was not uneasy because he did not know what she would speakyooof and what he must answer. And he was not afraid of her simply as ayoowoman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent his life, from earlyyoochildhood till he entered the monastery, entirely with women. He wasyooafraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He had been afraid of her fromyoothe first time he saw her. He had only seen her two or three times, andyoohad only chanced to say a few words to her. He thought of her as ayoobeautiful, proud, imperious girl. It was not her beauty which troubledyoohim, but something else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increasedyoothe apprehension itself. The girl’s aims were of the noblest, he knewyoothat. She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity,yoothough he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyoshayoorecognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, ayooshiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house.yooyooHe reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a friend,yoowith her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father. Dmitri he was evenyoomore certain not to find there, and he had a foreboding of the reason. Andyooso his conversation would be with her alone. He had a great longing to runyooand see his brother Dmitri before that fateful interview. Without showingyoohim the letter, he could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long wayyoooff, and he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for ayoominute, he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with a rapid andyooaccustomed gesture, and at once smiling, he turned resolutely in theyoodirection of his terrible lady.yooyooHe knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then across theyoomarket-place, it was a long way round. Though our town is small, it isyooscattered, and the houses are far apart. And meanwhile his father wasyooexpecting him, and perhaps had not yet forgotten his command. He might beyoounreasonable, and so he had to make haste to get there and back. So heyoodecided to take a short cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of theyooground. This meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossingyooother people’s back-yards, where every one he met knew him and greetedyoohim. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the time.yooyooHe had to pass the garden adjoining his father’s, and belonging to ayoolittle tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of this house, asyooAlyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with her daughter, who hadyoobeen a genteel maid-servant in generals’ families in Petersburg. Now sheyoohad been at home a year, looking after her sick mother. She always dressedyooup in fine clothes, though her old mother and she had sunk into suchyoopoverty that they went every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s kitchen for soupyooand bread, which Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the young woman came upyoofor soup, she had never sold any of her dresses, and one of these even hadyooa long train—a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin, who alwaysyooknew everything that was going on in the town. He had forgotten it as soonyooas he heard it, but now, on reaching the garden, he remembered the dressyoowith the train, raised his head, which had been bowed in thought, and cameyooupon something quite unexpected.yooyooOver the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something, was leaningyooforward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously afraid toyooutter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha ran up to the hurdle.yooyoo“It’s a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,” Mityayoosaid in a joyful, hurried whisper. “Climb in here quickly! How splendidyoothat you’ve come! I was just thinking of you!”yooyooAlyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over the hurdle.yooMitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help him jump. Tucking upyoohis cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle with the agility of ayoobare-legged street urchin.yooyoo“Well done! Now come along,” said Mitya in an enthusiastic whisper.yooyoo“Where?” whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself in ayoodeserted garden with no one near but themselves. The garden was small, butyoothe house was at least fifty paces away.yooyoo“There’s no one here. Why do you whisper?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!” cried Dmitri at the top of his voice.yoo“You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here in secret, and onyoothe watch. I’ll explain later on, but, knowing it’s a secret, I beganyoowhispering like a fool, when there’s no need. Let us go. Over there. Tillyoothen be quiet. I want to kiss you.yooyooyoo    Glory to God in the world,yoo    Glory to God in me ...yooyooyooI was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.”yooyooThe garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees onlyyooalong the fence at the four sides. There were apple-trees, maples, limesyooand birch-trees. The middle of the garden was an empty grass space, fromyoowhich several hundredweight of hay was carried in the summer. The gardenyoowas let out for a few roubles for the summer. There were also plantationsyooof raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides; ayookitchen garden had been planted lately near the house.yooyooDmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden. There,yooin a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant, elder,yoosnowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green summer-house,yooblackened with age. Its walls were of lattice-work, but there was still ayooroof which could give shelter. God knows when this summer-house was built.yooThere was a tradition that it had been put up some fifty years before by ayooretired colonel called von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time. Ityoowas all in decay, the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, theyoowoodwork smelled musty. In the summer-house there was a green wooden tableyoofixed in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which ityoowas still possible to sit. Alyosha had at once observed his brother’syooexhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he saw half a bottle ofyoobrandy and a wineglass on the table.yooyoo“That’s brandy,” Mitya laughed. “I see your look: ‘He’s drinking again!’yooDistrust the apparition.yooyooyoo    Distrust the worthless, lying crowd,yoo    And lay aside thy doubts.yooyooyooI’m not drinking, I’m only ‘indulging,’ as that pig, your Rakitin, says.yooHe’ll be a civil councilor one day, but he’ll always talk aboutyoo‘indulging.’ Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press youyooto my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world—in reality—inyoore-al-i-ty—(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!”yooyooHe uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.yooyoo“No one but you and one ‘jade’ I have fallen in love with, to my ruin. Butyoobeing in love doesn’t mean loving. You may be in love with a woman and yetyoohate her. Remember that! I can talk about it gayly still. Sit down here byyoothe table and I’ll sit beside you and look at you, and go on talking. Youyooshall keep quiet and I’ll go on talking, for the time has come. But onyooreflection, you know, I’d better speak quietly, for here—here—you canyoonever tell what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as theyyoosay, ‘the story will be continued.’ Why have I been longing for you? Whyyoohave I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? (It’s fiveyoodays since I’ve cast anchor here.) Because it’s only to you I can tellyooeverything; because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow I shallyoofly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending and beginning. Haveyooyou ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling down a precipice into ayoopit? That’s just how I’m falling, but not in a dream. And I’m not afraid,yooand don’t you be afraid. At least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it. It’s notyooenjoyment though, but ecstasy. Damn it all, whatever it is! A strongyoospirit, a weak spirit, a womanish spirit—whatever it is! Let us praiseyoonature: you see what sunshine, how clear the sky is, the leaves are allyoogreen, it’s still summer; four o’clock in the afternoon and the stillness!yooWhere were you going?”yooyoo“I was going to father’s, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna’s first.”yooyoo“To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I waiting for you?yooHungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in myyooribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as toyoohave done with her and with father. To send an angel. I might have sentyooany one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way toyoosee father and her.”yooyoo“Did you really mean to send me?” cried Alyosha with a distressedyooexpression.yooyoo“Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be quiet,yoobe quiet for a time. Don’t be sorry, and don’t cry.”yooyooDmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead.yooyoo“She’s asked you, written to you a letter or something, that’s why you’reyoogoing to her? You wouldn’t be going except for that?”yooyoo“Here is her note.” Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya lookedyoothrough it quickly.yooyoo“And you were going the back-way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him byyoothe back-way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly oldyoofishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I mean toyootell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in heaven I’veyootold already; but I want to tell an angel on earth. You are an angel onyooearth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And that’s what I need, thatyoosome one above me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away fromyooeverything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them,yooand before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and says,yoo‘Do this for me’—some favor never asked before that could only be asked onyooone’s deathbed—would that other refuse, if he were a friend or a brother?”yooyoo“I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“Make haste! H’m!... Don’t be in a hurry, Alyosha, you hurry and worryyooyourself. There’s no need to hurry now. Now the world has taken a newyooturning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can’t understand ecstasy. But whatyooam I saying to him? As though you didn’t understand it. What an ass I am!yooWhat am I saying? ‘Be noble, O man!’—who says that?”yooyooAlyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed, his workyoolay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment, with his elbow on theyootable and his head in his hand. Both were silent.yooyoo“Alyosha,” said Mitya, “you’re the only one who won’t laugh. I should likeyooto begin—my confession—with Schiller’s _Hymn to Joy_, _An die Freude_! Iyoodon’t know German, I only know it’s called that. Don’t think I’m talkingyoononsense because I’m drunk. I’m not a bit drunk. Brandy’s all very well,yoobut I need two bottles to make me drunk:yooyooyoo    Silenus with his rosy phizyoo    Upon his stumbling ass.yooyooyooBut I’ve not drunk a quarter of a bottle, and I’m not Silenus. I’m notyooSilenus, though I am strong,(1) for I’ve made a decision once for all.yooForgive me the pun; you’ll have to forgive me a lot more than puns to-day.yooDon’t be uneasy. I’m not spinning it out. I’m talking sense, and I’ll comeyooto the point in a minute. I won’t keep you in suspense. Stay, how does ityoogo?”yooyooHe raised his head, thought a minute, and began with enthusiasm:yooyooyoo    “Wild and fearful in his cavernyoo     Hid the naked troglodyte,yoo     And the homeless nomad wanderedyoo     Laying waste the fertile plain.yoo     Menacing with spear and arrowyoo     In the woods the hunter strayed....yoo     Woe to all poor wretches strandedyoo     On those cruel and hostile shores!yooyoo    “From the peak of high Olympusyoo     Came the mother Ceres down,yoo     Seeking in those savage regionsyoo     Her lost daughter Proserpine.yoo     But the Goddess found no refuge,yoo     Found no kindly welcome there,yoo     And no temple bearing witnessyoo     To the worship of the gods.yooyoo    “From the fields and from the vineyardsyoo     Came no fruits to deck the feasts,yoo     Only flesh of bloodstained victimsyoo     Smoldered on the altar-fires,yoo     And where’er the grieving goddessyoo     Turns her melancholy gaze,yoo     Sunk in vilest degradationyoo     Man his loathsomeness displays.”yooyooyooMitya broke into sobs and seized Alyosha’s hand.yooyoo“My dear, my dear, in degradation, in degradation now, too. There’s ayooterrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible lot of trouble.yooDon’t think I’m only a brute in an officer’s uniform, wallowing in dirtyooand drink. I hardly think of anything but of that degraded man—if only I’myoonot lying. I pray God I’m not lying and showing off. I think about thatyooman because I am that man myself.yooyooyoo    Would he purge his soul from vilenessyoo    And attain to light and worth,yoo    He must turn and cling for everyoo    To his ancient Mother Earth.yooyooyooBut the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I don’tyookiss her. I don’t cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a peasant or ayooshepherd? I go on and I don’t know whether I’m going to shame or to lightyooand joy. That’s the trouble, for everything in the world is a riddle! Andyoowhenever I’ve happened to sink into the vilest degradation (and it’syooalways been happening) I always read that poem about Ceres and man. Has ityooreformed me? Never! For I’m a Karamazov. For when I do leap into the pit,yooI go headlong with my heels up, and am pleased to be falling in thatyoodegrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in the very depths ofyoothat degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be accursed. Let me beyoovile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my God isyooshrouded. Though I may be following the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and Iyoolove Thee, and I feel the joy without which the world cannot stand.yooyooyoo    Joy everlasting fosterethyoo    The soul of all creation,yoo    It is her secret ferment firesyoo    The cup of life with flame.yoo    ’Tis at her beck the grass hath turnedyoo    Each blade towards the lightyoo    And solar systems have evolvedyoo    From chaos and dark night,yoo    Filling the realms of boundless spaceyoo    Beyond the sage’s sight.yoo    At bounteous Nature’s kindly breast,yoo    All things that breathe drink Joy,yoo    And birds and beasts and creeping thingsyoo    All follow where She leads.yoo    Her gifts to man are friends in need,yoo    The wreath, the foaming must,yoo    To angels—vision of God’s throne,yoo    To insects—sensual lust.yooyooyooBut enough poetry! I am in tears; let me cry. It may be foolishness thatyooevery one would laugh at. But you won’t laugh. Your eyes are shining, too.yooEnough poetry. I want to tell you now about the insects to whom God gaveyoo“sensual lust.”yooyooyoo    To insects—sensual lust.yooyooyooI am that insect, brother, and it is said of me specially. All weyooKaramazovs are such insects, and, angel as you are, that insect lives inyooyou, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood. Tempests, becauseyoosensual lust is a tempest—worse than a tempest! Beauty is a terrible andyooawful thing! It is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never canyoobe fathomed, for God sets us nothing but riddles. Here the boundaries meetyooand all contradictions exist side by side. I am not a cultivated man,yoobrother, but I’ve thought a lot about this. It’s terrible what mysteriesyoothere are! Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them asyoowe can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can’t endureyoothe thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal ofyoothe Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What’s still more awful isyoothat a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the idealyooof the Madonna, and his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely onyoofire, just as in his days of youth and innocence. Yes, man is broad, tooyoobroad, indeed. I’d have him narrower. The devil only knows what to make ofyooit! What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart.yooIs there beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankindyoobeauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The awful thing isyoothat beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil areyoofighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man. But a man alwaysyootalks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to facts.”yooyooyooyooChapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart—In Anecdoteyooyooyoo“I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I spent severalyoothousand roubles in seducing young girls. That’s a swinish invention, andyoothere was nothing of the sort. And if there was, I didn’t need moneyyoosimply for _that_. With me money is an accessory, the overflow of myyooheart, the framework. To-day she would be my lady, to-morrow a wench outyooof the streets in her place. I entertained them both. I threw away moneyyooby the handful on music, rioting, and gypsies. Sometimes I gave it to theyooladies, too, for they’ll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and beyoopleased and thankful for it. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all ofyoothem, but it happened, it happened. But I always liked side-paths, littleyoodark back-alleys behind the main road—there one finds adventures andyoosurprises, and precious metal in the dirt. I am speaking figuratively,yoobrother. In the town I was in, there were no such back-alleys in theyooliteral sense, but morally there were. If you were like me, you’d knowyoowhat that means. I loved vice, I loved the ignominy of vice. I lovedyoocruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a noxious insect? In fact a Karamazov!yooOnce we went, a whole lot of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It wasyoodark, it was winter, and I began squeezing a girl’s hand, and forced heryooto kiss me. She was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle,yoosubmissive creature. She allowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. Sheyoothought, poor thing, that I should come next day to make her an offer (Iyoowas looked upon as a good match, too). But I didn’t say a word to her foryoofive months. I used to see her in a corner at dances (we were alwaysyoohaving dances), her eyes watching me. I saw how they glowed with fire—ayoofire of gentle indignation. This game only tickled that insect lust Iyoocherished in my soul. Five months later she married an official and leftyoothe town, still angry, and still, perhaps, in love with me. Now they liveyoohappily. Observe that I told no one. I didn’t boast of it. Though I’m fullyooof low desires, and love what’s low, I’m not dishonorable. You’reyooblushing; your eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all thisyoowas nothing much—wayside blossoms _à la_ Paul de Kock—though the cruelyooinsect had already grown strong in my soul. I’ve a perfect album ofyooreminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I tried to break ityoooff without quarreling. And I never gave them away. I never bragged of oneyooof them. But that’s enough. You can’t suppose I brought you here simply toyootalk of such nonsense. No, I’m going to tell you something more curious;yooand don’t be surprised that I’m glad to tell you, instead of beingyooashamed.”yooyoo“You say that because I blushed,” Alyosha said suddenly. “I wasn’tyooblushing at what you were saying or at what you’ve done. I blushed becauseyooI am the same as you are.”yooyoo“You? Come, that’s going a little too far!”yooyoo“No, it’s not too far,” said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea was not ayoonew one). “The ladder’s the same. I’m at the bottom step, and you’reyooabove, somewhere about the thirteenth. That’s how I see it. But it’s allyoothe same. Absolutely the same in kind. Any one on the bottom step is boundyooto go up to the top one.”yooyoo“Then one ought not to step on at all.”yooyoo“Any one who can help it had better not.”yooyoo“But can you?”yooyoo“I think not.”yooyoo“Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you touch me so.yooThat rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told me once that she’dyoodevour you one day. There, there, I won’t! From this field of corruptionyoofouled by flies, let’s pass to my tragedy, also befouled by flies, that isyooby every sort of vileness. Although the old man told lies about myyooseducing innocence, there really was something of the sort in my tragedy,yoothough it was only once, and then it did not come off. The old man who hasyooreproached me with what never happened does not even know of this fact; Iyoonever told any one about it. You’re the first, except Ivan, of course—Ivanyooknows everything. He knew about it long before you. But Ivan’s a tomb.”yooyoo“Ivan’s a tomb?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyooAlyosha listened with great attention.yooyoo“I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision,yoolike a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in the littleyootown. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be rich; I thought soyoomyself. But I must have pleased them in other ways as well. Although theyyooshook their heads over me, they liked me. My colonel, who was an old man,yootook a sudden dislike to me. He was always down upon me, but I hadyoopowerful friends, and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so heyoocouldn’t do me much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat himyoowith proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who wasyooreally a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two wives,yooboth dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left a daughter asyoounpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of four and twenty when Iyoowas there, and was living with her father and an aunt, her mother’syoosister. The aunt was simple and illiterate; the niece was simple butyoolively. I like to say nice things about people. I never knew a woman ofyoomore charming character than Agafya—fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna!yooAnd she wasn’t bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, withyooa full figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She hadyoonot married, although she had had two suitors. She refused them, but wasyooas cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her, not in ‘that’ way, it wasyoopure friendship. I have often been friendly with women quite innocently. Iyooused to talk to her with shocking frankness, and she only laughed. Manyyoowomen like such freedom, and she was a girl too, which made it veryyooamusing. Another thing, one could never think of her as a young lady. Sheyooand her aunt lived in her father’s house with a sort of voluntaryyoohumility, not putting themselves on an equality with other people. She wasyooa general favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a cleveryoodressmaker. She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely withoutyooasking for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she didn’t refuse.yooThe colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He was one of theyoochief personages in the district. He kept open house, entertained theyoowhole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I arrived and joined theyoobattalion, all the town was talking of the expected return of theyoocolonel’s second daughter, a great beauty, who had just left a fashionableyooschool in the capital. This second daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and sheyoowas the child of the second wife, who belonged to a distinguishedyoogeneral’s family; although, as I learnt on good authority, she too broughtyoothe colonel no money. She had connections, and that was all. There mayyoohave been expectations, but they had come to nothing.yooyoo“Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit, the wholeyootown revived. Our most distinguished ladies—two ‘Excellencies’ and ayoocolonel’s wife—and all the rest following their lead, at once took her upyooand gave entertainments in her honor. She was the belle of the balls andyoopicnics, and they got up _tableaux vivants_ in aid of distressedyoogovernesses. I took no notice, I went on as wildly as before, and one ofyoomy exploits at the time set all the town talking. I saw her eyes taking myyoomeasure one evening at the battery commander’s, but I didn’t go up to her,yooas though I disdained her acquaintance. I did go up and speak to her at anyooevening party not long after. She scarcely looked at me, and compressedyooher lips scornfully. ‘Wait a bit. I’ll have my revenge,’ thought I. Iyoobehaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I wasyooconscious of it myself. What made it worse was that I felt that ‘Katenka’yoowas not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a person of character, proudyooand really high-principled; above all, she had education and intellect,yooand I had neither. You think I meant to make her an offer? No, I simplyyoowanted to revenge myself, because I was such a hero and she didn’t seem toyoofeel it.yooyoo“Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonelyooput me under arrest for three days. Just at that time father sent me sixyoothousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed giving up all claimsyooupon him—settling our accounts, so to speak, and saying that I wouldn’tyooexpect anything more. I didn’t understand a word of it at the time. UntilyooI came here, Alyosha, till the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, Iyoohaven’t been able to make head or tail of my money affairs with father.yooBut never mind that, we’ll talk of it later.yooyoo“Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling meyoosomething that interested me immensely. The authorities, I learnt, wereyoodissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He was suspected ofyooirregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise for him.yooAnd then the commander of the division arrived, and kicked up the devil ofyooa shindy. Shortly afterwards he was ordered to retire. I won’t tell youyoohow it all happened. He had enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a markedyoocoolness in the town towards him and all his family. His friends allyooturned their backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met AgafyayooIvanovna, with whom I’d always kept up a friendship, and said, ‘Do youyooknow there’s a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in youryoofather’s accounts?’yooyoo“ ‘What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general was here not longyooago, and everything was all right.’yooyoo“ ‘Then it was, but now it isn’t.’yooyoo“She was terribly scared.yooyoo“ ‘Don’t frighten me!’ she said. ‘Who told you so?’yooyoo“ ‘Don’t be uneasy,’ I said, ‘I won’t tell any one. You know I’m as silentyooas the tomb. I only wanted, in view of “possibilities,” to add, that whenyoothey demand that 4,500 roubles from your father, and he can’t produce it,yoohe’ll be tried, and made to serve as a common soldier in his old age,yoounless you like to send me your young lady secretly. I’ve just had moneyyoopaid me. I’ll give her four thousand, if you like, and keep the secretyooreligiously.’yooyoo“ ‘Ah, you scoundrel!’—that’s what she said. ‘You wicked scoundrel! Howyoodare you!’yooyoo“She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her once moreyoothat the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple creatures, Agafyayooand her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved like perfect angels allyoothrough this business. They genuinely adored their ‘Katya,’ thought heryoofar above them, and waited on her, hand and foot. But Agafya told her ofyooour conversation. I found that out afterwards. She didn’t keep it back,yooand of course that was all I wanted.yooyoo“Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion. The oldyoolieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn’t leave his room for twoyoodays, and didn’t hand over the government money. Dr. Kravchenko declaredyoothat he really was ill. But I knew for a fact, and had known for a longyootime, that for the last four years the money had never been in his handsyooexcept when the Commander made his visits of inspection. He used to lendyooit to a trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an oldyoowidower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. He used to go to theyoofair, do a profitable business with the money, and return the whole sum toyoothe colonel, bringing with it a present from the fair, as well as interestyooon the loan. But this time (I heard all about it quite by chance fromyooTrifonov’s son and heir, a driveling youth and one of the most vicious inyoothe world)—this time, I say, Trifonov brought nothing back from the fair.yooThe lieutenant-colonel flew to him. ‘I’ve never received any money fromyooyou, and couldn’t possibly have received any.’ That was all the answer heyoogot. So now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towelyooround his head, while they’re all three busy putting ice on it. All atyooonce an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order to ‘handyooover the battalion money immediately, within two hours.’ He signed theyoobook (I saw the signature in the book afterwards), stood up, saying heyoowould put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom, loaded his double-barreledyoogun with a service bullet, took the boot off his right foot, fixed the gunyooagainst his chest, and began feeling for the trigger with his foot. ButyooAgafya, remembering what I had told her, had her suspicions. She stole upyooand peeped into the room just in time. She rushed in, flung herself uponyoohim from behind, threw her arms round him, and the gun went off, hit theyooceiling, but hurt no one. The others ran in, took away the gun, and heldyoohim by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home, it wasyoogetting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out. I had dressed, brushedyoomy hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up my cap, when suddenly theyoodoor opened, and facing me in the room stood Katerina Ivanovna.yooyoo“It’s strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen her in theyoostreet, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged with two decrepityooold ladies, who looked after me. They were most obliging old things, readyyooto do anything for me, and at my request were as silent afterwards as twoyoocast-iron posts. Of course I grasped the position at once. She walked inyooand looked straight at me, her dark eyes determined, even defiant, but onyooher lips and round her mouth I saw uncertainty.yooyoo“ ‘My sister told me,’ she began, ‘that you would give me 4,500 roubles ifyooI came to you for it—myself. I have come ... give me the money!’yooyoo“She couldn’t keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her voice failedyooher, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it quivered.yooAlyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?”yooyoo“Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,” said Alyosha in agitation.yooyoo“I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened I shan’tyoospare myself. My first idea was a—Karamazov one. Once I was bitten by ayoocentipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with fever from it. Well, Iyoofelt a centipede biting at my heart then—a noxious insect, you understand?yooI looked her up and down. You’ve seen her? She’s a beauty. But she wasyoobeautiful in another way then. At that moment she was beautiful becauseyooshe was noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all the grandeur of heryoogenerosity and sacrifice for her father, and I—a bug! And, scoundrel as Iyoowas, she was altogether at my mercy, body and soul. She was hemmed in. Iyootell you frankly, that thought, that venomous thought, so possessed myyooheart that it almost swooned with suspense. It seemed as if there could beyoono resisting it; as though I should act like a bug, like a venomousyoospider, without a spark of pity. I could scarcely breathe. Understand, Iyooshould have gone next day to ask for her hand, so that it might endyoohonorably, so to speak, and that nobody would or could know. For thoughyooI’m a man of base desires, I’m honest. And at that very second some voiceyooseemed to whisper in my ear, ‘But when you come to-morrow to make youryooproposal, that girl won’t even see you; she’ll order her coachman to kickyooyou out of the yard. “Publish it through all the town,” she would say,yoo“I’m not afraid of you.” ’ I looked at the young lady, my voice had notyoodeceived me. That is how it would be, not a doubt of it. I could see fromyooher face now that I should be turned out of the house. My spite wasyooroused. I longed to play her the nastiest swinish cad’s trick: to look atyooher with a sneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun heryoowith a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.yooyoo“ ‘Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You’ve been countingyooyour chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred, if you like, with all myyooheart. But four thousand is not a sum to throw away on such frivolity.yooYou’ve put yourself out to no purpose.’yooyoo“I should have lost the game, of course. She’d have run away. But it wouldyoohave been an infernal revenge. It would have been worth it all. I’d haveyoohowled with regret all the rest of my life, only to have played thatyootrick. Would you believe it, it has never happened to me with any otheryoowoman, not one, to look at her at such a moment with hatred. But, on myyoooath, I looked at her for three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearfulyoohatred—that hate which is only a hair’s-breadth from love, from theyoomaddest love!yooyoo“I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane, and Iyooremember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep her long,yoodon’t be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table, opened the draweryooand took out a banknote for five thousand roubles (it was lying in ayooFrench dictionary). Then I showed it her in silence, folded it, handed ityooto her, opened the door into the passage, and, stepping back, made her ayoodeep bow, a most respectful, a most impressive bow, believe me! Sheyooshuddered all over, gazed at me for a second, turned horribly pale—whiteyooas a sheet, in fact—and all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently,yoobowed down to my feet—not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow,yoowith her forehead to the floor. She jumped up and ran away. I was wearingyoomy sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot; why, Iyoodon’t know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose ityoowas from delight. Can you understand that one might kill oneself fromyoodelight? But I didn’t stab myself. I only kissed my sword and put it backyooin the scabbard—which there was no need to have told you, by the way. AndyooI fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it onyoorather thick to glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all whoyoopry into the human heart! Well, so much for that ‘adventure’ with KaterinayooIvanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you—no one else.”yooyooDmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out hisyoohandkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not in the sameyooplace as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to turnyooquite round to face him.yooyooyooyooChapter V. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart—"Heels Up"yooyooyoo“Now,” said Alyosha, “I understand the first half.”yooyoo“You understand the first half. That half is a drama, and it was playedyooout there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is being acted here.”yooyoo“And I understand nothing of that second half so far,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“And I? Do you suppose I understand it?”yooyoo“Stop, Dmitri. There’s one important question. Tell me, you wereyoobetrothed, you are betrothed still?”yooyoo“We weren’t betrothed at once, not for three months after that adventure.yooThe next day I told myself that the incident was closed, concluded, thatyoothere would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish to make her an offer. Onyooher side she gave no sign of life for the six weeks that she remained inyoothe town; except, indeed, for one action. The day after her visit theyoomaid-servant slipped round with an envelope addressed to me. I tore ityooopen: it contained the change out of the banknote. Only four thousand fiveyoohundred roubles was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundredyooon changing it. She only sent me about two hundred and sixty. I don’tyooremember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation. I searchedyoothe packet for a pencil mark—n-nothing! Well, I spent the rest of theyoomoney on such an orgy that the new major was obliged to reprimand me.yooyoo“Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to theyooastonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the moneyyoountouched. He’d no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to his bed, and,yoothree weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he died five daysyooafterwards. He was buried with military honors, for he had not had time toyooreceive his discharge. Ten days after his funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, withyooher aunt and sister, went to Moscow. And, behold, on the very day theyyoowent away (I hadn’t seen them, didn’t see them off or take leave) Iyooreceived a tiny note, a sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one lineyooin pencil: ‘I will write to you. Wait. K.’ And that was all.yooyoo“I’ll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes changedyoowith the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness of an Arabianyoofairy-tale. That general’s widow, their nearest relation, suddenly lostyoothe two nieces who were her heiresses and next-of-kin—both died in theyoosame week of small-pox. The old lady, prostrated with grief, welcomedyooKatya as a daughter, as her one hope, clutched at her, altered her will inyooKatya’s favor. But that concerned the future. Meanwhile she gave her, foryoopresent use, eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do whatyooshe liked with. She was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her inyooMoscow, later.yooyoo“Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred roubles. Iyoowas speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three days later cameyoothe promised letter. I have it with me now. You must read it. She offersyooto be my wife, offers herself to me. ‘I love you madly,’ she says, ‘evenyooif you don’t love me, never mind. Be my husband. Don’t be afraid. I won’tyoohamper you in any way. I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet underyooyour feet. I want to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.’yooAlyosha, I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and inyoomy vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure myselfyooof. That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don’t mind—that I don’tyoomind still? I wrote her an answer at once, as it was impossible for me toyoogo to Moscow. I wrote to her with tears. One thing I shall be ashamed ofyoofor ever. I referred to her being rich and having a dowry while I was onlyyooa stuck-up beggar! I mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence,yoobut it slipped from my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him allyooI could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her. Why do youyoolook like that? Why are you staring at me? Yes, Ivan fell in love withyooher; he’s in love with her still. I know that. I did a stupid thing, inyoothe world’s opinion; but perhaps that one stupid thing may be the savingyooof us all now. Oo! Don’t you see what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how sheyoorespects him? When she compares us, do you suppose she can love a man likeyoome, especially after all that has happened here?”yooyoo“But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not a man likeyoohim.”yooyoo“She loves her own _virtue_, not me.” The words broke involuntarily, andyooalmost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a minute later his eyesyoogleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the table violently with his fist.yooyoo“I swear, Alyosha,” he cried, with intense and genuine anger at himself;yoo“you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ is God, I swearyoothat though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just now, I know that I am ayoomillion times baser in soul than she, and that these lofty sentiments ofyoohers are as sincere as a heavenly angel’s. That’s the tragedy of it—that Iyooknow that for certain. What if any one does show off a bit? Don’t I do ityoomyself? And yet I’m sincere, I’m sincere. As for Ivan, I can understandyoohow he must be cursing nature now—with his intellect, too! To see theyoopreference given—to whom, to what? To a monster who, though he isyoobetrothed and all eyes are fixed on him, can’t restrain hisyoodebaucheries—and before the very eyes of his betrothed! And a man like meyoois preferred, while he is rejected. And why? Because a girl wants toyoosacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude. It’s ridiculous! I’veyoonever said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of course has never dropped ayoohint of the sort to me. But destiny will be accomplished, and the best manyoowill hold his ground while the undeserving one will vanish into hisyooback-alley for ever—his filthy back-alley, his beloved back-alley, whereyoohe is at home and where he will sink in filth and stench at his own freeyoowill and with enjoyment. I’ve been talking foolishly. I’ve no words left.yooI use them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in theyooback-alley, and she will marry Ivan.”yooyoo“Stop, Dmitri,” Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety. “There’s oneyoothing you haven’t made clear yet: you are still betrothed all the same,yooaren’t you? How can you break off the engagement if she, your betrothed,yoodoesn’t want to?”yooyoo“Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my arrival inyooMoscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine style. The general’syoowife blessed us, and—would you believe it?—congratulated Katya. ‘You’veyoomade a good choice,’ she said, ‘I see right through him.’ And—would youyoobelieve it?—she didn’t like Ivan, and hardly greeted him. I had a lot ofyootalk with Katya in Moscow. I told her about myself—sincerely, honorably.yooShe listened to everything.yooyooyoo    There was sweet confusion,yoo    There were tender words.yooyooyooThough there were proud words, too. She wrung out of me a mighty promiseyooto reform. I gave my promise, and here—”yooyoo“What?”yooyoo“Why, I called to you and brought you out here to-day, this veryyooday—remember it—to send you—this very day again—to Katerina Ivanovna,yooand—”yooyoo“What?”yooyoo“To tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, ‘He sends youyoohis compliments.’ ”yooyoo“But is that possible?”yooyoo“That’s just the reason I’m sending you, in my place, because it’syooimpossible. And, how could I tell her myself?”yooyoo“And where are you going?”yooyoo“To the back-alley.”yooyoo“To Grushenka, then!” Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping his hands.yoo“Can Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought that you had justyoovisited her, and that was all.”yooyoo“Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible and withyoosuch a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world? Confound it, Iyoohave some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka, I ceased to beyoobetrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand that. Why do you look atyoome? You see, I went in the first place to beat her. I had heard, and Iyooknow for a fact now, that that captain, father’s agent, had givenyooGrushenka an I.O.U. of mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put anyooend to me. They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had ayooglimpse of her before. She doesn’t strike one at first sight. I knew aboutyooher old merchant, who’s lying ill now, paralyzed; but he’s leaving her ayoodecent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of money, that sheyoohoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that she’s ayoomerciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I stayed. The stormyoobroke—it struck me down like the plague. I’m plague-stricken still, and Iyooknow that everything is over, that there will never be anything more foryoome. The cycle of the ages is accomplished. That’s my position. And thoughyooI’m a beggar, as fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in myyoopocket. I drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts fromyoohere. I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants thereyoodrunk on it, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands flying. Inyoothree days’ time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you suppose the heroyoohad gained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I tell you that rogue,yooGrushenka, has a supple curve all over her body. You can see it in heryoolittle foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and kissed it, but that wasyooall, I swear! ‘I’ll marry you if you like,’ she said, ‘you’re a beggar,yooyou know. Say that you won’t beat me, and will let me do anything Iyoochoose, and perhaps I will marry you.’ She laughed, and she’s laughingyoostill!”yooyooDmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as though heyoowere drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.yooyoo“And do you really mean to marry her?”yooyoo“At once, if she will. And if she won’t, I shall stay all the same. I’llyoobe the porter at her gate. Alyosha!” he cried. He stopped short beforeyoohim, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking him violently. “Do youyooknow, you innocent boy, that this is all delirium, senseless delirium, foryoothere’s a tragedy here. Let me tell you, Alexey, that I may be a low man,yoowith low and degraded passions, but a thief and a pickpocket DmitriyooKaramazov never can be. Well, then; let me tell you that I am a thief andyooa pickpocket. That very morning, just before I went to beat Grushenka,yooKaterina Ivanovna sent for me, and in strict secrecy (why I don’t know, Iyoosuppose she had some reason) asked me to go to the chief town of theyooprovince and to post three thousand roubles to Agafya Ivanovna in Moscow,yooso that nothing should be known of it in the town here. So I had thatyoothree thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to see Grushenka, and ityoowas that money we spent at Mokroe. Afterwards I pretended I had been toyoothe town, but did not show her the post office receipt. I said I had sentyoothe money and would bring the receipt, and so far I haven’t brought it.yooI’ve forgotten it. Now what do you think you’re going to her to-day toyoosay? ‘He sends his compliments,’ and she’ll ask you, ‘What about theyoomoney?’ You might still have said to her, ‘He’s a degraded sensualist, andyooa low creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn’t send your moneyyoothen, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn’t controlyoohimself.’ But still you might have added, ‘He isn’t a thief though. Hereyoois your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to AgafyayooIvanovna. But he told me to say “he sends his compliments.” ’ But, as ityoois, she will ask, ‘But where is the money?’ ”yooyoo“Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think. Don’t worryyooyourself to death with despair.”yooyoo“What, do you suppose I’d shoot myself because I can’t get three thousandyooto pay back? That’s just it. I shan’t shoot myself. I haven’t the strengthyoonow. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I’m going to Grushenka. I don’t careyoowhat happens.”yooyoo“And what then?”yooyoo“I’ll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers come, I’llyoogo into the next room. I’ll clean her friends’ goloshes, blow up theiryoosamovar, run their errands.”yooyoo“Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all,” Alyosha said solemnly. “She’llyoounderstand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She has a loftyyoomind, and no one could be more unhappy than you. She’ll see that foryooherself.”yooyoo“She won’t forgive everything,” said Dmitri, with a grin. “There’syoosomething in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do you know whatyoowould be the best thing to do?”yooyoo“What?”yooyoo“Pay back the three thousand.”yooyoo“Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will give youyooanother thousand—that makes three. Take it and pay it back.”yooyoo“And when would you get it, your three thousand? You’re not of age,yoobesides, and you must—you absolutely must—take my farewell to her to-day,yoowith the money or without it, for I can’t drag on any longer, things haveyoocome to such a pass. To-morrow is too late. I shall send you to father.”yooyoo“To father?”yooyoo“Yes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand.”yooyoo“But, Mitya, he won’t give it.”yooyoo“As though he would! I know he won’t. Do you know the meaning of despair,yooAlexey?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Listen. Legally he owes me nothing. I’ve had it all from him, I knowyoothat. But morally he owes me something, doesn’t he? You know he startedyoowith twenty-eight thousand of my mother’s money and made a hundredyoothousand with it. Let him give me back only three out of the twenty-eightyoothousand, and he’ll draw my soul out of hell, and it will atone for manyyooof his sins. For that three thousand—I give you my solemn word—I’ll makeyooan end of everything, and he shall hear nothing more of me. For the lastyootime I give him the chance to be a father. Tell him God Himself sends himyoothis chance.”yooyoo“Mitya, he won’t give it for anything.”yooyoo“I know he won’t. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially. That’s notyooall. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago, perhaps onlyyooyesterday he found out for the first time _in earnest_ (underline _inyooearnest_) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking, and really means toyoomarry me. He knows her nature; he knows the cat. And do you suppose he’syoogoing to give me money to help to bring that about when he’s crazy aboutyooher himself? And that’s not all, either. I can tell you more than that. Iyooknow that for the last five days he has had three thousand drawn out ofyoothe bank, changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a largeyooenvelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape. You seeyoohow well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: ‘To my angel,yooGrushenka, when she will come to me.’ He scrawled it himself in silenceyooand in secret, and no one knows that the money’s there except the valet,yooSmerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now he has been expectingyooGrushenka for the last three or four days; he hopes she’ll come for theyoomoney. He has sent her word of it, and she has sent him word that perhapsyooshe’ll come. And if she does go to the old man, can I marry her afteryoothat? You understand now why I’m here in secret and what I’m on the watchyoofor.”yooyoo“For her?”yooyoo“Yes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here. Fomayoocomes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He does jobs foryoothem. He’s watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting in the day-time; andyoothat’s how he lives. I’ve established myself in his room. Neither he noryoothe women of the house know the secret—that is, that I am on the watchyoohere.”yooyoo“No one but Smerdyakov knows, then?”yooyoo“No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.”yooyoo“It was he told you about the money, then?”yooyoo“Yes. It’s a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn’t know about the money, oryooanything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on a two or threeyoodays’ journey. A purchaser has turned up for the copse: he’ll give eightyoothousand for the timber. So the old man keeps asking Ivan to help him byyoogoing to arrange it. It will take him two or three days. That’s what theyooold man wants, so that Grushenka can come while he’s away.”yooyoo“Then he’s expecting Grushenka to-day?”yooyoo“No, she won’t come to-day; there are signs. She’s certain not to come,”yoocried Mitya suddenly. “Smerdyakov thinks so, too. Father’s drinking now.yooHe’s sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him, Alyosha, and ask for the threeyoothousand.”yooyoo“Mitya, dear, what’s the matter with you?” cried Alyosha, jumping up fromyoohis place, and looking keenly at his brother’s frenzied face. For oneyoomoment the thought struck him that Dmitri was mad.yooyoo“What is it? I’m not insane,” said Dmitri, looking intently and earnestlyyooat him. “No fear. I am sending you to father, and I know what I’m saying.yooI believe in miracles.”yooyoo“In miracles?”yooyoo“In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He sees myyoodespair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won’t let something awfulyoohappen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!”yooyoo“I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?”yooyoo“Yes. I know it will take some time. You can’t go at him point blank. He’syoodrunk now. I’ll wait three hours—four, five, six, seven. Only remember youyoomust go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day, if it has to be at midnight, _withyoothe money or without the money_, and say, ‘He sends his compliments toyooyou.’ I want you to say that verse to her: ‘He sends his compliments toyooyou.’ ”yooyoo“Mitya! And what if Grushenka comes to-day—if not to-day, to-morrow, oryoothe next day?”yooyoo“Grushenka? I shall see her. I shall rush out and prevent it.”yooyoo“And if—”yooyoo“If there’s an if, it will be murder. I couldn’t endure it.”yooyoo“Who will be murdered?”yooyoo“The old man. I shan’t kill her.”yooyoo“Brother, what are you saying?”yooyoo“Oh, I don’t know.... I don’t know. Perhaps I shan’t kill, and perhaps Iyooshall. I’m afraid that he will suddenly become so loathsome to me with hisyooface at that moment. I hate his ugly throat, his nose, his eyes, hisyooshameless snigger. I feel a physical repulsion. That’s what I’m afraid of.yooThat’s what may be too much for me.”yooyoo“I’ll go, Mitya. I believe that God will order things for the best, thatyoonothing awful may happen.”yooyoo“And I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesn’t come to pass—”yooyooAlyosha went thoughtfully towards his father’s house.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. SmerdyakovyooyooyooHe did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was ayoodining-room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the drawing-room,yoowhich was the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned ostentation.yooThe furniture was white and very old, upholstered in old, red, silkyyoomaterial. In the spaces between the windows there were mirrors inyooelaborate white and gilt frames, of old-fashioned carving. On the walls,yoocovered with white paper, which was torn in many places, there hung twoyoolarge portraits—one of some prince who had been governor of the districtyoothirty years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead.yooIn the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which ayoolamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional purposes asyooto light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to bed very late, at threeyooor four o’clock in the morning, and would wander about the room at nightyooor sit in an arm-chair, thinking. This had become a habit with him. Heyoooften slept quite alone in the house, sending his servants to the lodge;yoobut usually Smerdyakov remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.yooyooWhen Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves had beenyooserved. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after dinner.yooIvan was also at table, sipping coffee. The servants, Grigory andyooSmerdyakov, were standing by. Both the gentlemen and the servants seemedyooin singularly good spirits. Fyodor Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter.yooBefore he entered the room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he knew soyoowell, and could tell from the sound of it that his father had only reachedyoothe good-humored stage, and was far from being completely drunk.yooyoo“Here he is! Here he is!” yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted atyooseeing Alyosha. “Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten dish, but it’s hotyooand good. I don’t offer you brandy, you’re keeping the fast. But would youyoolike some? No; I’d better give you some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov,yoogo to the cupboard, the second shelf on the right. Here are the keys. Lookyoosharp!”yooyooAlyosha began refusing the liqueur.yooyoo“Never mind. If you won’t have it, we will,” said Fyodor Pavlovitch,yoobeaming. “But stay—have you dined?”yooyoo“Yes,” answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece of bread andyoodrunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior’s kitchen. “Though I shouldyoobe pleased to have some hot coffee.”yooyoo“Bravo, my darling! He’ll have some coffee. Does it want warming? No, it’syooboiling. It’s capital coffee: Smerdyakov’s making. My Smerdyakov’s anyooartist at coffee and at fish patties, and at fish soup, too. You must comeyooone day and have some fish soup. Let me know beforehand.... But, stay;yoodidn’t I tell you this morning to come home with your mattress and pillowyooand all? Have you brought your mattress? He he he!”yooyoo“No, I haven’t,” said Alyosha, smiling, too.yooyoo“Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning, weren’tyooyou? There, my darling, I couldn’t do anything to vex you. Do you know,yooIvan, I can’t resist the way he looks one straight in the face and laughs?yooIt makes me laugh all over. I’m so fond of him. Alyosha, let me give youyoomy blessing—a father’s blessing.”yooyooAlyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his mind.yooyoo“No, no,” he said. “I’ll just make the sign of the cross over you, foryoonow. Sit still. Now we’ve a treat for you, in your own line, too. It’llyoomake you laugh. Balaam’s ass has begun talking to us here—and how heyootalks! How he talks!”yooyooBalaam’s ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a young manyooof about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and taciturn. Not that heyoowas shy or bashful. On the contrary, he was conceited and seemed toyoodespise everybody.yooyooBut we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was brought up byyooGrigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up “with no sense of gratitude,” asyooGrigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly boy, and seemed to look at theyooworld mistrustfully. In his childhood he was very fond of hanging cats,yooand burying them with great ceremony. He used to dress up in a sheet asyoothough it were a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the deadyoocat as though it were a censer. All this he did on the sly, with theyoogreatest secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this diversion and gave him ayoosound beating. He shrank into a corner and sulked there for a week. “Heyoodoesn’t care for you or me, the monster,” Grigory used to say to Marfa,yoo“and he doesn’t care for any one. Are you a human being?” he said,yooaddressing the boy directly. “You’re not a human being. You grew from theyoomildew in the bath-house.(2) That’s what you are.” Smerdyakov, it appearedyooafterwards, could never forgive him those words. Grigory taught him toyooread and write, and when he was twelve years old, began teaching him theyooScriptures. But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or thirdyoolesson the boy suddenly grinned.yooyoo“What’s that for?” asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly from underyoohis spectacles.yooyoo“Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun, moon, andyoostars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from on the first day?”yooyooGrigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his teacher.yooThere was something positively condescending in his expression. Grigoryyoocould not restrain himself. “I’ll show you where!” he cried, and gave theyooboy a violent slap on the cheek. The boy took the slap without a word, butyoowithdrew into his corner again for some days. A week later he had hisyoofirst attack of the disease to which he was subject all the rest of hisyoolife—epilepsy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boyyooseemed changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though heyoonever scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met him.yooSometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the boy somethingyoosweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his illness, he showed anyooactive interest in him, sent for a doctor, and tried remedies, but theyoodisease turned out to be incurable. The fits occurred, on an average, onceyooa month, but at various intervals. The fits varied too, in violence: someyoowere light and some were very severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbadeyooGrigory to use corporal punishment to the boy, and began allowing him toyoocome upstairs to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for ayootime, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitchyoonoticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles through theyooglass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books—over a hundred—but noyooone ever saw him reading. He at once gave Smerdyakov the key of theyoobookcase. “Come, read. You shall be my librarian. You’ll be better sittingyooreading than hanging about the courtyard. Come, read this,” and FyodoryooPavlovitch gave him _Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka_.yooyooHe read a little but didn’t like it. He did not once smile, and ended byyoofrowning.yooyoo“Why? Isn’t it funny?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.yooyooSmerdyakov did not speak.yooyoo“Answer, stupid!”yooyoo“It’s all untrue,” mumbled the boy, with a grin.yooyoo“Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay, here’syooSmaragdov’s _Universal History_. That’s all true. Read that.”yooyooBut Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov. He thought ityoodull. So the bookcase was closed again.yooyooShortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch thatyooSmerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinaryyoofastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his spoon and lookyoointo the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a spoonful and hold it toyoothe light.yooyoo“What is it? A beetle?” Grigory would ask.yooyoo“A fly, perhaps,” observed Marfa.yooyooThe squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with his bread,yoohis meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece on his fork to theyoolight, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after long deliberationyoodecide to put it in his mouth.yooyoo“Ach! What fine gentlemen’s airs!” Grigory muttered, looking at him.yooyooWhen Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov heyoodetermined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow to be trained. Heyoospent some years there and came back remarkably changed in appearance. Heyoolooked extraordinarily old for his age. His face had grown wrinkled,yooyellow, and strangely emasculate. In character he seemed almost exactlyyoothe same as before he went away. He was just as unsociable, and showed notyoothe slightest inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as weyooheard afterwards, he had always been silent. Moscow itself had littleyoointerest for him; he saw very little there, and took scarcely any noticeyooof anything. He went once to the theater, but returned silent andyoodispleased with it. On the other hand, he came back to us from Moscow wellyoodressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He brushed his clothes mostyooscrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very fond of cleaning hisyoosmart calf boots with a special English polish, so that they shone likeyoomirrors. He turned out a first-rate cook. Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him ayoosalary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade,yooperfumes, and such things. But he seemed to have as much contempt for theyoofemale sex as for men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them.yooFyodor Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits wereyoobecoming more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which didyoonot suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.yooyoo“Why are your fits getting worse?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, lookingyooaskance at his new cook. “Would you like to get married? Shall I find youyooa wife?”yooyooBut Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. FyodoryooPavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great thing was that heyoohad absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened once, when FyodoryooPavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in the muddy courtyard threeyoohundred-rouble notes which he had only just received. He only missed themyoonext day, and was just hastening to search his pockets when he saw theyoonotes lying on the table. Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had pickedyoothem up and brought them in the day before.yooyoo“Well, my lad, I’ve never met any one like you,” Fyodor Pavlovitch saidyooshortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he not only believed inyoohis honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking for him, although theyooyoung man looked as morosely at him as at every one and was always silent.yooHe rarely spoke. If it had occurred to any one to wonder at the time whatyoothe young man was interested in, and what was in his mind, it would haveyoobeen impossible to tell by looking at him. Yet he used sometimes to stopyoosuddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would standyoostill for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist studying his faceyoowould have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection, but only ayoosort of contemplation. There is a remarkable picture by the painteryooKramskoy, called “Contemplation.” There is a forest in winter, and on ayooroadway through the forest, in absolute solitude, stands a peasant in ayootorn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands, as it were, lost in thought. Yet heyoois not thinking; he is “contemplating.” If any one touched him he wouldyoostart and look at one as though awakening and bewildered. It’s true heyoowould come to himself immediately; but if he were asked what he had beenyoothinking about, he would remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hiddenyoowithin himself, the impression which had dominated him during the periodyooof contemplation. Those impressions are dear to him and no doubt he hoardsyoothem imperceptibly, and even unconsciously. How and why, of course, heyoodoes not know either. He may suddenly, after hoarding impressions for manyyooyears, abandon everything and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for hisyoosoul’s salvation, or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his nativeyoovillage, and perhaps do both. There are a good many “contemplatives” amongyoothe peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he probablyyoowas greedily hoarding up his impressions, hardly knowing why.yooyooyooyooChapter VII. The ControversyyooyooyooBut Balaam’s ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a strange one.yooGrigory had gone in the morning to make purchases, and had heard from theyooshopkeeper Lukyanov the story of a Russian soldier which had appeared inyoothe newspaper of that day. This soldier had been taken prisoner in someyooremote part of Asia, and was threatened with an immediate agonizing deathyooif he did not renounce Christianity and follow Islam. He refused to denyyoohis faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising andyooglorifying Christ. Grigory had related the story at table. FyodoryooPavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and talk,yooif only with Grigory. This afternoon he was in a particularly good-humoredyooand expansive mood. Sipping his brandy and listening to the story, heyooobserved that they ought to make a saint of a soldier like that, and toyootake his skin to some monastery. “That would make the people flock, andyoobring the money in.”yooyooGrigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means touched,yoobut, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment Smerdyakov, who wasyoostanding by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov often waited at table towards theyooend of dinner, and since Ivan’s arrival in our town he had done so everyyooday.yooyoo“What are you grinning at?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching the smileyooinstantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.yooyoo“Well, my opinion is,” Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly in ayooloud voice, “that if that laudable soldier’s exploit was so very greatyoothere would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it if he had on such anyooemergency renounced, so to speak, the name of Christ and his ownyoochristening, to save by that same his life, for good deeds, by which, inyoothe course of years to expiate his cowardice.”yooyoo“How could it not be a sin? You’re talking nonsense. For that you’ll goyoostraight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,” put in FyodoryooPavlovitch.yooyooIt was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch, as weyoohave seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.yooyoo“We’re on your subject, your subject,” he chuckled gleefully, makingyooAlyosha sit down to listen.yooyoo“As for mutton, that’s not so, and there’ll be nothing there for this, andyoothere shouldn’t be either, if it’s according to justice,” Smerdyakovyoomaintained stoutly.yooyoo“How do you mean ‘according to justice’?” Fyodor Pavlovitch cried stillyoomore gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.yooyoo“He’s a rascal, that’s what he is!” burst from Grigory. He lookedyooSmerdyakov wrathfully in the face.yooyoo“As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,” answeredyooSmerdyakov with perfect composure. “You’d better consider yourself that,yooonce I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the Christian race, and theyyoodemand from me to curse the name of God and to renounce my holyyoochristening, I am fully entitled to act by my own reason, since thereyoowould be no sin in it.”yooyoo“But you’ve said that before. Don’t waste words. Prove it,” cried FyodoryooPavlovitch.yooyoo“Soup-maker!” muttered Grigory contemptuously.yooyoo“As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for yourself,yooGrigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as I say to thoseyooenemies, ‘No, I’m not a Christian, and I curse my true God,’ then at once,yooby God’s high judgment, I become immediately and specially anathemayooaccursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as though I were ayooheathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, butyoowhen I think of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I amyoocut off. Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?”yooyooHe addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was reallyyooanswering Fyodor Pavlovitch’s questions, and was well aware of it, andyoointentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions.yooyoo“Ivan,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, “stoop down for me to whisper.yooHe’s got this all up for your benefit. He wants you to praise him. Praiseyoohim.”yooyooIvan listened with perfect seriousness to his father’s excited whisper.yooyoo“Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch once more.yoo“Ivan, your ear again.”yooyooIvan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.yooyoo“I love you as I do Alyosha. Don’t think I don’t love you. Some brandy?”yooyoo“Yes.—But you’re rather drunk yourself,” thought Ivan, looking steadily atyoohis father.yooyooHe was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.yooyoo“You’re anathema accursed, as it is,” Grigory suddenly burst out, “and howyoodare you argue, you rascal, after that, if—”yooyoo“Don’t scold him, Grigory, don’t scold him,” Fyodor Pavlovitch cut himyooshort.yooyoo“You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time, and listen,yoofor I haven’t finished all I had to say. For at the very moment I becomeyooaccursed, at that same highest moment, I become exactly like a heathen,yooand my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail. Isn’t thatyooso?”yooyoo“Make haste and finish, my boy,” Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him, sipping fromyoohis wine-glass with relish.yooyoo“And if I’ve ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the enemyyoowhen they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian, seeing I hadyooalready been relieved by God Himself of my Christianity by reason of theyoothought alone, before I had time to utter a word to the enemy. And if Iyoohave already been discharged, in what manner and with what sort of justiceyoocan I be held responsible as a Christian in the other world for havingyoodenied Christ, when, through the very thought alone, before denying Him Iyoohad been relieved from my christening? If I’m no longer a Christian, thenyooI can’t renounce Christ, for I’ve nothing then to renounce. Who will holdyooan unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even in heaven, foryoonot having been born a Christian? And who would punish him for that,yooconsidering that you can’t take two skins off one ox? For God AlmightyyooHimself, even if He did make the Tatar responsible, when he dies wouldyoogive him the smallest possible punishment, I imagine (since he must beyoopunished), judging that he is not to blame if he has come into the worldyooan unclean heathen, from heathen parents. The Lord God can’t surely take ayooTatar and say he was a Christian? That would mean that the Almighty wouldyootell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth tell a lie, evenyooin one word?”yooyooGrigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes nearlyyoostarting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand what wasyoosaid, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and stood, looking like ayooman who has just hit his head against a wall. Fyodor Pavlovitch emptiedyoohis glass and went off into his shrill laugh.yooyoo“Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He must haveyoobeen with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking Jesuit, whoyootaught you? But you’re talking nonsense, you casuist, nonsense, nonsense,yoononsense. Don’t cry, Grigory, we’ll reduce him to smoke and ashes in ayoomoment. Tell me this, O ass; you may be right before your enemies, but youyoohave renounced your faith all the same in your own heart, and you sayyooyourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed. And if onceyooyou’re anathema they won’t pat you on the head for it in hell. What do youyoosay to that, my fine Jesuit?”yooyoo“There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but there wasyoono special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the most ordinary.”yooyoo“How’s that the most ordinary?”yooyoo“You lie, accursed one!” hissed Grigory.yooyoo“Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,” Smerdyakov went on, staid andyoounruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous to theyoovanquished foe. “Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch; it is said inyoothe Scripture that if you have faith, even as a mustard seed, and bid ayoomountain move into the sea, it will move without the least delay at youryoobidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I’m without faith and you have soyoogreat a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourselfyootelling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that’s a long way off,yoobut even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of theyoogarden. You’ll see for yourself that it won’t budge, but will remain justyoowhere it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, GrigoryyooVassilyevitch, that you haven’t faith in the proper manner, and only abuseyooothers about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day,yoonot only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowestyoopeasant, can shove mountains into the sea—except perhaps some one man inyoothe world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their soulsyooin secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn’t find them—ifyooso it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? thatyoois, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in theyoodesert, and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them? Andyooso I’m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgivenyooif I shed tears of repentance.”yooyoo“Stay!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. “So you doyoosuppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it,yoowrite it down. There you have the Russian all over!”yooyoo“You’re quite right in saying it’s characteristic of the people’s faith,”yooIvan assented, with an approving smile.yooyoo“You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It’s true, isn’t it,yooAlyosha? That’s the Russian faith all over, isn’t it?”yooyoo“No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,” said Alyosha firmly andyoogravely.yooyoo“I’m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, onlyyoothat idea. Surely that’s Russian, isn’t it?”yooyoo“Yes, that’s purely Russian,” said Alyosha smiling.yooyoo“Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I’ll give it to you to-day.yooBut as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you,yoostupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness,yoobecause we haven’t time; things are too much for us, and, in the secondyooplace, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty-four hours inyoothe day, so that one hasn’t even time to get sleep enough, much less toyoorepent of one’s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemiesyoowhen you’d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So Iyooconsider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.”yooyoo“Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,yoothat it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed thenyooin very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have beenyoosinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to theyoopagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn’t have come to tortureyoothen, because I should only have had to say at that instant to theyoomountain, ‘Move and crush the tormentor,’ and it would have moved and atyoothe very instant have crushed him like a black-beetle, and I should haveyoowalked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.yooBut, suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to thatyoomountain, ‘Crush these tormentors,’ and it hadn’t crushed them, how couldyooI have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such a dread hour ofyoomortal terror? And apart from that, I should know already that I could notyooattain to the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven (for since the mountainyoohad not moved at my word, they could not think very much of my faith upyooaloft, and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world toyoocome). So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to noyoogood purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my back,yooeven then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my cry. Andyooat such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one might loseyooone’s reason from fear, so that one would not be able to think at all.yooAnd, therefore, how should I be particularly to blame if not seeing myyooadvantage or reward there or here, I should, at least, save my skin. Andyooso trusting fully in the grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope thatyooI might be altogether forgiven.”yooyooyooyooChapter VIII. Over The BrandyyooyooyooThe controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch, who hadyoobeen so gay, suddenly began frowning. He frowned and gulped brandy, and ityoowas already a glass too much.yooyoo“Get along with you, Jesuits!” he cried to the servants. “Go away,yooSmerdyakov. I’ll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day, but beyoooff! Don’t cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She’ll comfort you and put you toyoobed. The rascals won’t let us sit in peace after dinner,” he snappedyoopeevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew at his word.yooyoo“Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It’s you he’s soyoointerested in. What have you done to fascinate him?” he added to Ivan.yooyoo“Nothing whatever,” answered Ivan. “He’s pleased to have a high opinion ofyoome; he’s a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material for revolution, however,yoowhen the time comes.”yooyoo“For revolution?”yooyoo“There will be others and better ones. But there will be some like him asyoowell. His kind will come first, and better ones after.”yooyoo“And when will the time come?”yooyoo“The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants are not veryyoofond of listening to these soup-makers, so far.”yooyoo“Ah, brother, but a Balaam’s ass like that thinks and thinks, and theyoodevil knows where he gets to.”yooyoo“He’s storing up ideas,” said Ivan, smiling.yooyoo“You see, I know he can’t bear me, nor any one else, even you, though youyoofancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still with Alyosha, heyoodespises Alyosha. But he doesn’t steal, that’s one thing, and he’s not ayoogossip, he holds his tongue, and doesn’t wash our dirty linen in public.yooHe makes capital fish pasties too. But, damn him, is he worth talkingyooabout so much?”yooyoo“Of course he isn’t.”yooyoo“And as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant, generallyyoospeaking, needs thrashing. That I’ve always maintained. Our peasants areyooswindlers, and don’t deserve to be pitied, and it’s a good thing they’reyoostill flogged sometimes. Russia is rich in birches. If they destroyed theyooforests, it would be the ruin of Russia. I stand up for the clever people.yooWe’ve left off thrashing the peasants, we’ve grown so clever, but they goyooon thrashing themselves. And a good thing too. ‘For with what measure yeyoomete it shall be measured to you again,’ or how does it go? Anyhow, ityoowill be measured. But Russia’s all swinishness. My dear, if you only knewyoohow I hate Russia.... That is, not Russia, but all this vice! But maybe Iyoomean Russia. _Tout cela c’est de la cochonnerie_.... Do you know what Iyoolike? I like wit.”yooyoo“You’ve had another glass. That’s enough.”yooyoo“Wait a bit. I’ll have one more, and then another, and then I’ll stop. No,yoostay, you interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to an old man, and heyootold me: ‘There’s nothing we like so much as sentencing girls to beyoothrashed, and we always give the lads the job of thrashing them. And theyoogirl he has thrashed to-day, the young man will ask in marriage to-morrow.yooSo it quite suits the girls, too,’ he said. There’s a set of de Sades foryooyou! But it’s clever, anyway. Shall we go over and have a look at it, eh?yooAlyosha, are you blushing? Don’t be bashful, child. I’m sorry I didn’tyoostay to dinner at the Superior’s and tell the monks about the girls atyooMokroe. Alyosha, don’t be angry that I offended your Superior thisyoomorning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He exists, then, ofyoocourse, I’m to blame, and I shall have to answer for it. But if thereyooisn’t a God at all, what do they deserve, your fathers? It’s not enough toyoocut their heads off, for they keep back progress. Would you believe it,yooIvan, that that lacerates my sentiments? No, you don’t believe it as I seeyoofrom your eyes. You believe what people say, that I’m nothing but ayoobuffoon. Alyosha, do you believe that I’m nothing but a buffoon?”yooyoo“No, I don’t believe it.”yooyoo“And I believe you don’t, and that you speak the truth. You look sincereyooand you speak sincerely. But not Ivan. Ivan’s supercilious.... I’d make anyooend of your monks, though, all the same. I’d take all that mystic stuffyooand suppress it, once for all, all over Russia, so as to bring all theyoofools to reason. And the gold and the silver that would flow into theyoomint!”yooyoo“But why suppress it?” asked Ivan.yooyoo“That Truth may prevail. That’s why.”yooyoo“Well, if Truth were to prevail, you know, you’d be the first to be robbedyooand suppressed.”yooyoo“Ah! I dare say you’re right. Ah, I’m an ass!” burst out FyodoryooPavlovitch, striking himself lightly on the forehead. “Well, youryoomonastery may stand then, Alyosha, if that’s how it is. And we cleveryoopeople will sit snug and enjoy our brandy. You know, Ivan, it must haveyoobeen so ordained by the Almighty Himself. Ivan, speak, is there a God oryoonot? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing again?”yooyoo“I’m laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now aboutyooSmerdyakov’s belief in the existence of two saints who could moveyoomountains.”yooyoo“Why, am I like him now, then?”yooyoo“Very much.”yooyoo“Well, that shows I’m a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic.yooAnd you may be caught in the same way, though you are a philosopher. ShallyooI catch you? What do you bet that I’ll catch you to-morrow. Speak, all theyoosame, is there a God, or not? Only, be serious. I want you to be seriousyoonow.”yooyoo“No, there is no God.”yooyoo“Alyosha, is there a God?”yooyoo“There is.”yooyoo“Ivan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a tinyyoobit?”yooyoo“There is no immortality either.”yooyoo“None at all?”yooyoo“None at all.”yooyoo“There’s absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something?yooAnything is better than nothing!”yooyoo“Absolute nothingness.”yooyoo“Alyosha, is there immortality?”yooyoo“There is.”yooyoo“God and immortality?”yooyoo“God and immortality. In God is immortality.”yooyoo“H’m! It’s more likely Ivan’s right. Good Lord! to think what faith, whatyooforce of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that dream, and foryoohow many thousand years. Who is it laughing at man? Ivan! For the lastyootime, once for all, is there a God or not? I ask for the last time!”yooyoo“And for the last time there is not.”yooyoo“Who is laughing at mankind, Ivan?”yooyoo“It must be the devil,” said Ivan, smiling.yooyoo“And the devil? Does he exist?”yooyoo“No, there’s no devil either.”yooyoo“It’s a pity. Damn it all, what wouldn’t I do to the man who firstyooinvented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too good for him.”yooyoo“There would have been no civilization if they hadn’t invented God.”yooyoo“Wouldn’t there have been? Without God?”yooyoo“No. And there would have been no brandy either. But I must take youryoobrandy away from you, anyway.”yooyoo“Stop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. I’ve hurt Alyosha’syoofeelings. You’re not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear little Alexey!”yooyoo“No, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is better than youryoohead.”yooyoo“My heart better than my head, is it? Oh, Lord! And that from you. Ivan,yoodo you love Alyosha?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“You must love him” (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk).yoo“Listen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning. But I wasyooexcited. But there’s wit in that elder, don’t you think, Ivan?”yooyoo“Very likely.”yooyoo“There is, there is. _Il y a du Piron là-dedans._ He’s a Jesuit, a Russianyooone, that is. As he’s an honorable person there’s a hidden indignationyooboiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness.”yooyoo“But, of course, he believes in God.”yooyoo“Not a bit of it. Didn’t you know? Why, he tells every one so, himself.yooThat is, not every one, but all the clever people who come to him. He saidyoostraight out to Governor Schultz not long ago: ‘_Credo_, but I don’t knowyooin what.’ ”yooyoo“Really?”yooyoo“He really did. But I respect him. There’s something of Mephistophelesyooabout him, or rather of ‘The hero of our time’ ... Arbenin, or what’s hisyooname?... You see, he’s a sensualist. He’s such a sensualist that I shouldyoobe afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him. Youyooknow, when he begins telling stories.... The year before last he invitedyoous to tea, tea with liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur), and beganyootelling us about old times till we nearly split our sides.... Especiallyyoohow he once cured a paralyzed woman. ‘If my legs were not bad I know ayoodance I could dance you,’ he said. What do you say to that? ‘I’ve plentyyooof tricks in my time,’ said he. He did Dernidov, the merchant, out ofyoosixty thousand.”yooyoo“What, he stole it?”yooyoo“He brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying, ‘Take care ofyooit for me, friend, there’ll be a police search at my place to-morrow.’ Andyoohe kept it. ‘You have given it to the Church,’ he declared. I said to him:yoo‘You’re a scoundrel,’ I said. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I’m not a scoundrel, but I’myoobroad-minded.’ But that wasn’t he, that was some one else. I’ve muddledyoohim with some one else ... without noticing it. Come, another glass andyoothat’s enough. Take away the bottle, Ivan. I’ve been telling lies. Whyyoodidn’t you stop me, Ivan, and tell me I was lying?”yooyoo“I knew you’d stop of yourself.”yooyoo“That’s a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me. Youyoodespise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own house.”yooyoo“Well, I’m going away. You’ve had too much brandy.”yooyoo“I’ve begged you for Christ’s sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two,yooand you don’t go.”yooyoo“I’ll go to-morrow if you’re so set upon it.”yooyoo“You won’t go. You want to keep an eye on me. That’s what you want,yoospiteful fellow. That’s why you won’t go.”yooyooThe old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness when theyoodrunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and toyooassert himself.yooyoo“Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that? Your eyes look atyoome and say, ‘You ugly drunkard!’ Your eyes are mistrustful. They’reyoocontemptuous.... You’ve come here with some design. Alyosha, here, looksyooat me and his eyes shine. Alyosha doesn’t despise me. Alexey, you mustn’tyoolove Ivan.”yooyoo“Don’t be ill-tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking him,” Alyoshayoosaid emphatically.yooyoo“Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy, Ivan. It’s theyoothird time I’ve told you.”yooyooHe mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his face.yooyoo“Don’t be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don’t love me, butyoodon’t be angry all the same. You’ve nothing to love me for. You go toyooTchermashnya. I’ll come to you myself and bring you a present. I’ll showyooyou a little wench there. I’ve had my eye on her a long time. She’s stillyoorunning about bare-foot. Don’t be afraid of bare-footed wenches—don’tyoodespise them—they’re pearls!”yooyooAnd he kissed his hand with a smack.yooyoo“To my thinking,” he revived at once, seeming to grow sober the instant heyootouched on his favorite topic. “To my thinking ... Ah, you boys! Youyoochildren, little sucking-pigs, to my thinking ... I never thought a womanyoougly in my life—that’s been my rule! Can you understand that? How couldyooyou understand it? You’ve milk in your veins, not blood. You’re not out ofyooyour shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find somethingyoodevilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn’t find in any other.yooOnly, one must know how to find it, that’s the point! That’s a talent! Toyoomy mind there are no ugly women. The very fact that she is a woman is halfyoothe battle ... but how could you understand that? Even in _vieillesyoofilles_, even in them you may discover something that makes you simplyyoowonder that men have been such fools as to let them grow old withoutyoonoticing them. Bare-footed girls or unattractive ones, you must take byyoosurprise. Didn’t you know that? You must astound them till they’reyoofascinated, upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love withyoosuch a little slut. It’s a jolly good thing that there always are and willyoobe masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a littleyoomaid-of-all-work and her master, and you know, that’s all that’s neededyoofor happiness. Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to surprise youryoomother, but in a different way. I paid no attention to her at all, but allyooat once, when the minute came, I’d be all devotion to her, crawl on myyooknees, kiss her feet, and I always, always—I remember it as though it wereyooto-day—reduced her to that tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh.yooIt was peculiar to her. I knew her attacks always used to begin like that.yooThe next day she would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laughyoowas not a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit. That’syoothe great thing, to know how to take every one. Once Belyavsky—he was ayoohandsome fellow, and rich—used to like to come here and hang aboutyooher—suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence. And she—such ayoomild sheep—why, I thought she would have knocked me down for that blow.yooHow she set on me! ‘You’re beaten, beaten now,’ she said. ‘You’ve taken ayooblow from him. You have been trying to sell me to him,’ she said.... ‘Andyoohow dared he strike you in my presence! Don’t dare come near me again,yoonever, never! Run at once, challenge him to a duel!’... I took her to theyoomonastery then to bring her to her senses. The holy Fathers prayed heryooback to reason. But I swear, by God, Alyosha, I never insulted the pooryoocrazy girl! Only once, perhaps, in the first year; then she was very fondyooof praying. She used to keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and usedyooto turn me out of her room then. I’ll knock that mysticism out of her,yoothought I! ‘Here,’ said I, ‘you see your holy image. Here it is. Here Iyootake it down. You believe it’s miraculous, but here, I’ll spit on ityoodirectly and nothing will happen to me for it!’... When she saw it, goodyooLord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung heryoohands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all over andyoofell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha, what’s theyoomatter?”yooyooThe old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun speaking aboutyoohis mother, a change had gradually come over Alyosha’s face. He flushedyoocrimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered. The old sot had goneyoospluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something veryyoostrange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he was describing in the crazyyoowoman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seatyooexactly as his mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his faceyooin them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hystericalyooparoxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblanceyooto his mother particularly impressed the old man.yooyoo“Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It’s like her, exactly as she used to beyoothen, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth, that’s what Iyooused to do to her. He’s upset about his mother, his mother,” he mutteredyooto Ivan.yooyoo“But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she not?” saidyooIvan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old man shrank before hisyooflashing eyes. But something very strange had happened, though only for ayoosecond; it seemed really to have escaped the old man’s mind that Alyosha’syoomother actually was the mother of Ivan too.yooyoo“Your mother?” he muttered, not understanding. “What do you mean? Whatyoomother are you talking about? Was she?... Why, damn it! of course she wasyooyours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before. Excuse me,yoowhy, I was thinking, Ivan.... He he he!” He stopped. A broad, drunken,yoohalf-senseless grin overspread his face.yooyooAt that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, thereyoowere violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into theyooroom. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.yooyoo“He’ll kill me! He’ll kill me! Don’t let him get at me!” he screamed,yooclinging to the skirt of Ivan’s coat.yooyooyooyooChapter IX. The SensualistsyooyooyooGrigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had beenyoostruggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting onyooinstructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Takingyooadvantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room toyoolook about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors onyoothe opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stoodyoobefore the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend theyooentrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this,yooDmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.yooyoo“Then she’s there! She’s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!”yooyooHe tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Besideyoohimself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might.yooThe old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in theyoodoor. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room,yoohuddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.yooyoo“She’s here!” shouted Dmitri. “I saw her turn towards the house just now,yoobut I couldn’t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?”yooyooThat shout, “She’s here!” produced an indescribable effect on FyodoryooPavlovitch. All his terror left him.yooyoo“Hold him! Hold him!” he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigoryyoohad got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ranyooafter their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on theyoofloor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase—not an expensiveyooone—on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it.yooyoo“At him!” shouted the old man. “Help!”yooyooIvan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back.yooyoo“Why do you run after him? He’ll murder you outright,” Ivan criedyoowrathfully at his father.yooyoo“Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka’s here. He said he saw heryoohimself, running.”yooyooHe was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the suddenyoonews that she was here made him beside himself. He was trembling all over.yooHe seemed frantic.yooyoo“But you’ve seen for yourself that she hasn’t come,” cried Ivan.yooyoo“But she may have come by that other entrance.”yooyoo“You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.”yooyooDmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He had, of course, foundyoothe other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch’syoopocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka couldyoonot have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere.yooyoo“Hold him!” shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. “He’syoobeen stealing money in my bedroom.” And tearing himself from Ivan heyoorushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenlyyooclutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on hisyootemples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. Heyookicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old manyoomoaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms roundyoohim, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with hisyooslender strength, holding Dmitri in front.yooyoo“Madman! You’ve killed him!” cried Ivan.yooyoo“Serve him right!” shouted Dmitri breathlessly. “If I haven’t killed him,yooI’ll come again and kill him. You can’t protect him!”yooyoo“Dmitri! Go away at once!” cried Alyosha commandingly.yooyoo“Alexey! You tell me. It’s only you I can believe; was she here just now,yooor not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane. Iyooshouted, she ran away.”yooyoo“I swear she’s not been here, and no one expected her.”yooyoo“But I saw her.... So she must ... I’ll find out at once where she is....yooGood-by, Alexey! Not a word to Æsop about the money now. But go toyooKaterina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, ‘He sends his compliments toyooyou!’ Compliments, his compliments! Just compliments and farewell!yooDescribe the scene to her.”yooyooMeanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in anyooarm-chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was conscious andyoolistened greedily to Dmitri’s cries. He was still fancying that Grushenkayooreally was somewhere in the house. Dmitri looked at him with hatred as heyoowent out.yooyoo“I don’t repent shedding your blood!” he cried. “Beware, old man, bewareyooof your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you, and disown youyooaltogether.”yooyooHe ran out of the room.yooyoo“She’s here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!” the old manyoowheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his finger.yooyoo“No, she’s not here, you old lunatic!” Ivan shouted at him angrily. “Here,yoohe’s fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!”yooyooSmerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed, and putyoohim to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his head. Exhausted by theyoobrandy, by his violent emotion, and the blows he had received, he shut hisyooeyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. Ivan andyooAlyosha went back to the drawing-room. Smerdyakov removed the fragments ofyoothe broken vase, while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at theyoofloor.yooyoo“Shouldn’t you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed, too?” Alyoshayoosaid to him. “We’ll look after him. My brother gave you a terrible blow—onyoothe head.”yooyoo“He’s insulted me!” Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.yooyoo“He’s ‘insulted’ his father, not only you,” observed Ivan with a forcedyoosmile.yooyoo“I used to wash him in his tub. He’s insulted me,” repeated Grigory.yooyoo“Damn it all, if I hadn’t pulled him away perhaps he’d have murdered him.yooIt wouldn’t take much to do for Æsop, would it?” whispered Ivan toyooAlyosha.yooyoo“God forbid!” cried Alyosha.yooyoo“Why should He forbid?” Ivan went on in the same whisper, with a malignantyoogrimace. “One reptile will devour the other. And serve them both right,yootoo.”yooyooAlyosha shuddered.yooyoo“Of course I won’t let him be murdered as I didn’t just now. Stay here,yooAlyosha, I’ll go for a turn in the yard. My head’s begun to ache.”yooyooAlyosha went to his father’s bedroom and sat by his bedside behind theyooscreen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazedyoofor a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering and meditating. All atyooonce his face betrayed extraordinary excitement.yooyoo“Alyosha,” he whispered apprehensively, “where’s Ivan?”yooyoo“In the yard. He’s got a headache. He’s on the watch.”yooyoo“Give me that looking-glass. It stands over there. Give it me.”yooyooAlyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood on theyoochest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his nose wasyooconsiderably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead there was ayoorather large crimson bruise.yooyoo“What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I’m afraid of Ivan.yooI’m more afraid of Ivan than the other. You’re the only one I’m not afraidyooof....”yooyoo“Don’t be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he’ll defend you.”yooyoo“Alyosha, and what of the other? He’s run to Grushenka. My angel, tell meyoothe truth, was she here just now or not?”yooyoo“No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.”yooyoo“You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.”yooyoo“She won’t marry him.”yooyoo“She won’t. She won’t. She won’t. She won’t on any account!”yooyooThe old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more comfortingyoocould have been said to him. In his delight he seized Alyosha’s hand andyoopressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively glittered in his eyes.yooyoo“That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now,” heyoosaid. “Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I’ll let you go back toyoothe monastery.... I was joking this morning, don’t be angry with me. Myyoohead aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha, comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell meyoothe truth!”yooyoo“You’re still asking whether she has been here or not?” Alyosha saidyoosorrowfully.yooyoo“No, no, no. I believe you. I’ll tell you what it is: you go to Grushenkayooyourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her; see for yourself,yoowhich she means to choose, him or me. Eh? What? Can you?”yooyoo“If I see her I’ll ask her,” Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.yooyoo“No, she won’t tell you,” the old man interrupted, “she’s a rogue. She’llyoobegin kissing you and say that it’s you she wants. She’s a deceitful,yooshameless hussy. You mustn’t go to her, you mustn’t!”yooyoo“No, father, and it wouldn’t be suitable, it wouldn’t be right at all.”yooyoo“Where was he sending you just now? He shouted ‘Go’ as he ran away.”yooyoo“To Katerina Ivanovna.”yooyoo“For money? To ask her for money?”yooyoo“No. Not for money.”yooyoo“He’s no money; not a farthing. I’ll settle down for the night, and thinkyoothings over, and you can go. Perhaps you’ll meet her.... Only be sure toyoocome to me to-morrow in the morning. Be sure to. I have a word to say toyooyou to-morrow. Will you come?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“When you come, pretend you’ve come of your own accord to ask after me.yooDon’t tell any one I told you to. Don’t say a word to Ivan.”yooyoo“Very well.”yooyoo“Good-by, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall never forgetyooit. I’ve a word to say to you to-morrow—but I must think about it.”yooyoo“And how do you feel now?”yooyoo“I shall get up to-morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly well!”yooyooCrossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway.yooHe was sitting writing something in pencil in his note-book. Alyosha toldyooIvan that their father had waked up, was conscious, and had let him goyooback to sleep at the monastery.yooyoo“Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,” said Ivanyoocordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha.yooyoo“I shall be at the Hohlakovs’ to-morrow,” answered Alyosha, “I may be atyooKaterina Ivanovna’s, too, if I don’t find her now.”yooyoo“But you’re going to her now, anyway? For that ‘compliments andyoofarewell,’ ” said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.yooyoo“I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part of whatyoowent before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that he—well, inyoofact—takes his leave of her?”yooyoo“Brother, how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri?”yooexclaimed Alyosha.yooyoo“One can’t tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out.yooThat woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old man indoors andyoonot let Dmitri in the house.”yooyoo“Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at otheryoomen and decide which is worthy to live?”yooyoo“Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided inyoomen’s hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as for rights—who hasyoonot the right to wish?”yooyoo“Not for another man’s death?”yooyoo“What even if for another man’s death? Why lie to oneself since all menyoolive so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what Iyoosaid just now—that one reptile will devour the other? In that case let meyooask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding Æsop’s blood,yoomurdering him, eh?”yooyoo“What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind. I don’tyoothink Dmitri is capable of it, either.”yooyoo“Thanks, if only for that,” smiled Ivan. “Be sure, I should always defendyoohim. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case. Good-byyootill to-morrow. Don’t condemn me, and don’t look on me as a villain,” heyooadded with a smile.yooyooThey shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha felt thatyoohis brother had taken the first step towards him, and that he hadyoocertainly done this with some definite motive.yooyooyooyooChapter X. Both TogetheryooyooyooAlyosha left his father’s house feeling even more exhausted and dejectedyooin spirit than when he had entered it. His mind too seemed shattered andyoounhinged, while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointedyoofragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflictingyooexperiences of the day. He felt something bordering upon despair, which heyoohad never known till then. Towering like a mountain above all the restyoostood the fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between hisyoofather and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had himselfyoobeen a witness of it, he had been present and seen them face to face. Yetyooonly his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy, terribly, completelyyoounhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It appeared too that there wereyooother people concerned, far more so than Alyosha could have supposedyoobefore. There was something positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan hadyoomade a step towards him, which was what Alyosha had been long desiring.yooYet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it. And theseyoowomen? Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna’syooin the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind. On theyoocontrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance fromyooher. Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult thanyoobefore. The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably, andyooDmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope, might sink toyooany depth. He had, moreover, told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna theyooscene which had just taken place with his father.yooyooIt was by now seven o’clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha enteredyoothe very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied byyooKaterina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with two aunts. One ofyoothem, a woman of little education, was that aunt of her half-sister AgafyayooIvanovna who had looked after her in her father’s house when she came fromyooboarding-school. The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style andyooconsequence, though in straitened circumstances. It was said that theyyooboth gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only keptyoothem with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no oneyoobut her benefactress, the general’s widow, who had been kept by illness inyooMoscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice a week a full accountyooof all her doings.yooyooWhen Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door toyoohim to take his name up, it was evident that they were already aware ofyoohis arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the window. At least,yooAlyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustlingyooskirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had run out of the room.yooyooAlyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such excitement.yooHe was conducted however to the drawing-room at once. It was a large room,yooelegantly and amply furnished, not at all in provincial style. There wereyoomany sofas, lounges, settees, big and little tables. There were picturesyooon the walls, vases and lamps on the tables, masses of flowers, and evenyooan aquarium in the window. It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha madeyooout a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently justyoobeen sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cupsyooof chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another withyoosweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors, and frowned. Butyooat that instant the portière was raised, and with rapid, hurryingyoofootsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out both hands to Alyoshayoowith a radiant smile of delight. At the same instant a servant brought inyootwo lighted candles and set them on the table.yooyoo“Thank God! At last you have come too! I’ve been simply praying for youyooall day! Sit down.”yooyooAlyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna’s beauty when, three weeksyoobefore, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina Ivanovna’s specialyoorequest, to be introduced to her. There had been no conversation betweenyoothem at that interview, however. Supposing Alyosha to be very shy,yooKaterina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyoshayoohad been silent, but he had seen a great deal very clearly. He was struckyooby the imperiousness, proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl.yooAnd all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. Heyoothought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with heryoopale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in the linesyooof her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother mightyoowell be passionately in love, but which perhaps could not be loved foryoolong. He expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after theyoovisit, his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal hisyooimpressions on seeing his betrothed.yooyoo“You’ll be happy with her, but perhaps—not tranquilly happy.”yooyoo“Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They don’t yieldyooto fate. So you think I shan’t love her for ever.”yooyoo“No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you won’t always beyoohappy with her.”yooyooAlyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry withyoohimself for having yielded to his brother’s entreaties and put suchyoo“foolish” ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as awfullyyoofoolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed too of havingyoogiven so confident an opinion about a woman. It was with the moreyooamazement that he felt now, at the first glance at Katerina Ivanovna asyooshe ran in to him, that he had perhaps been utterly mistaken. This timeyooher face was beaming with spontaneous good-natured kindliness, and directyoowarm-hearted sincerity. The “pride and haughtiness,” which had struckyooAlyosha so much before, was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energyyooand a sort of bright, strong faith in herself. Alyosha realized at theyoofirst glance, at the first word, that all the tragedy of her position inyoorelation to the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her; that sheyooperhaps already knew everything, positively everything. And yet, in spiteyooof that, there was such brightness in her face, such faith in the future.yooAlyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts. Heyoowas conquered and captivated immediately. Besides all this, he noticed atyooher first words that she was in great excitement, an excitement perhapsyooquite exceptional and almost approaching ecstasy.yooyoo“I was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the wholeyootruth—from you and no one else.”yooyoo“I have come,” muttered Alyosha confusedly, “I—he sent me.”yooyoo“Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know everything—everything!” criedyooKaterina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing. “Wait a moment, Alexey Fyodorovitch,yooI’ll tell you why I’ve been so longing to see you. You see, I know perhapsyoofar more than you do yourself, and there’s no need for you to tell meyooanything. I’ll tell you what I want from you. I want to know your own lastyooimpression of him. I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarselyyooeven (oh, as coarsely as you like!), what you thought of him just now andyooof his position after your meeting with him to-day. That will perhaps beyoobetter than if I had a personal explanation with him, as he does not wantyooto come to me. Do you understand what I want from you? Now, tell meyoosimply, tell me every word of the message he sent you with (I knew heyoowould send you).”yooyoo“He told me to give you his compliments—and to say that he would neveryoocome again—but to give you his compliments.”yooyoo“His compliments? Was that what he said—his own expression?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word, perhaps he did notyoouse the right word?”yooyoo“No; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me two or threeyootimes not to forget to say so.”yooyooKaterina Ivanovna flushed hotly.yooyoo“Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your help. I’ll tellyooyou what I think, and you must simply say whether it’s right or not.yooListen! If he had sent me his compliments in passing, without insisting onyooyour repeating the words, without emphasizing them, that would be the endyooof everything! But if he particularly insisted on those words, if heyooparticularly told you not to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps heyoowas in excitement, beside himself. He had made his decision and wasyoofrightened at it. He wasn’t walking away from me with a resolute step, butyooleaping headlong. The emphasis on that phrase may have been simplyyoobravado.”yooyoo“Yes, yes!” cried Alyosha warmly. “I believe that is it.”yooyoo“And, if so, he’s not altogether lost. I can still save him. Stay! Did heyoonot tell you anything about money—about three thousand roubles?”yooyoo“He did speak about it, and it’s that more than anything that’s crushingyoohim. He said he had lost his honor and that nothing matters now,” Alyoshayooanswered warmly, feeling a rush of hope in his heart and believing thatyoothere really might be a way of escape and salvation for his brother. “Butyoodo you know about the money?” he added, and suddenly broke off.yooyoo“I’ve known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire, andyooheard long ago that the money had not arrived. He hadn’t sent the money,yoobut I said nothing. Last week I learnt that he was still in need of money.yooMy only object in all this was that he should know to whom to turn, andyoowho was his true friend. No, he won’t recognize that I am his truestyoofriend; he won’t know me, and looks on me merely as a woman. I’ve beenyootormented all the week, trying to think how to prevent him from beingyooashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let him feelyooashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people’s knowing, but notyooof my knowing. He can tell God everything without shame. Why is it heyoostill does not understand how much I am ready to bear for his sake? Why,yoowhy doesn’t he know me? How dare he not know me after all that hasyoohappened? I want to save him for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed.yooAnd here he fears that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasn’t afraidyooto be open with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I don’t deserveyoothe same?”yooyooThe last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.yooyoo“I must tell you,” Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, “what happenedyoojust now between him and my father.”yooyooAnd he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to get theyoomoney, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and after that hadyooagain specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments andyoofarewell. “He went to that woman,” Alyosha added softly.yooyoo“And do you suppose that I can’t put up with that woman? Does he think Iyoocan’t? But he won’t marry her,” she suddenly laughed nervously. “Couldyoosuch a passion last for ever in a Karamazov? It’s passion, not love. Heyoowon’t marry her because she won’t marry him.” Again Katerina Ivanovnayoolaughed strangely.yooyoo“He may marry her,” said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.yooyoo“He won’t marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you know that?yooDo you know that?” Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with extraordinaryyoowarmth. “She is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures. I knowyoohow bewitching she is, but I know too that she is kind, firm and noble.yooWhy do you look at me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you areyoowondering at my words, perhaps you don’t believe me? AgrafenayooAlexandrovna, my angel!” she cried suddenly to some one, peeping into theyoonext room, “come in to us. This is a friend. This is Alyosha. He knows allyooabout our affairs. Show yourself to him.”yooyoo“I’ve only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,” said ayoosoft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.yooyooThe portière was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming, cameyooup to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha. He fixed hisyooeyes on her and could not take them off. Here she was, that awful woman,yoothe “beast,” as Ivan had called her half an hour before. And yet one wouldyoohave thought the creature standing before him most simple and ordinary, ayoogood-natured, kind woman, handsome certainly, but so like other handsomeyooordinary women! It is true she was very, very good-looking with thatyooRussian beauty so passionately loved by many men. She was a rather tallyoowoman, though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who wasyooexceptionally tall. She had a full figure, with soft, as it were,yoonoiseless, movements, softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like heryoovoice. She moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step,yoobut noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor. She sankyoosoftly into a low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress,yooand delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders in ayoocostly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old, and her face lookedyooexactly that age. She was very white in the face, with a pale pink tint onyooher cheeks. The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad, andyoothe lower jaw was set a trifle forward. Her upper lip was thin, but theyooslightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full, and lookedyoopouting. But her magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable-coloredyooeyebrows and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would haveyoomade the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in theyoostreet, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after. Whatyoostruck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike goodyoonature. There was a childlike look in her eyes, a look of childishyoodelight. She came up to the table, beaming with delight and seeming toyooexpect something with childish, impatient, and confiding curiosity. Theyoolight in her eyes gladdened the soul—Alyosha felt that. There wasyoosomething else in her which he could not understand, or would not haveyoobeen able to define, and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him. Ityoowas that softness, that voluptuousness of her bodily movements, thatyoocatlike noiselessness. Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawlyoocould be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom. Heryoofigure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already inyoosomewhat exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. Connoisseurs ofyooRussian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this fresh, stillyooyouthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of thirty, wouldyoo“spread”; that the face would become puffy, and that wrinkles would veryyoosoon appear upon her forehead and round the eyes; the complexion wouldyoogrow coarse and red perhaps—in fact, that it was the beauty of the moment,yoothe fleeting beauty which is so often met with in Russian women. Alyosha,yooof course, did not think of this; but though he was fascinated, yet heyoowondered with an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why sheyoodrawled in that way and could not speak naturally. She did so evidentlyyoofeeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation of theyoosyllables. It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that showed badyooeducation and a false idea of good manners. And yet this intonation andyoomanner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost incredibly incongruous withyoothe childishly simple and happy expression of her face, the soft, babyishyoojoy in her eyes. Katerina Ivanovna at once made her sit down in anyooarm-chair facing Alyosha, and ecstatically kissed her several times on heryoosmiling lips. She seemed quite in love with her.yooyoo“This is the first time we’ve met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she saidyoorapturously. “I wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to her, butyooI’d no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I knew we shouldyoosettle everything together—everything. My heart told me so—I was beggedyoonot to take the step, but I foresaw it would be a way out of theyoodifficulty, and I was not mistaken. Grushenka has explained everything toyoome, told me all she means to do. She flew here like an angel of goodnessyooand brought us peace and joy.”yooyoo“You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,” drawled Grushenkayooin her sing-song voice, still with the same charming smile of delight.yooyoo“Don’t dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch! Disdainyooyou! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks as though ityoowere swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and more. Look how sheyoolaughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does one’s heart good to see the angel.”yooyooAlyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running down him.yooyoo“You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am not at allyooworthy of your kindness.”yooyoo“Not worthy! She’s not worthy of it!” Katerina Ivanovna cried again withyoothe same warmth. “You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we’re fanciful, we’reyooself-willed, but proudest of the proud in our little heart. We’re noble,yoowe’re generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let me tell you. We have only beenyoounfortunate. We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy,yooperhaps, or fickle man. There was one man—one, an officer too, we lovedyoohim, we sacrificed everything to him. That was long ago, five years ago,yooand he has forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a widower, he hasyoowritten, he is coming here, and, do you know, we’ve loved him, none butyoohim, all this time, and we’ve loved him all our life! He will come, andyooGrushenka will be happy again. For the last five years she’s beenyoowretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast of her favor? Only thatyoobedridden old merchant, but he is more like her father, her friend, heryooprotector. He found her then in despair, in agony, deserted by the man sheyooloved. She was ready to drown herself then, but the old merchant savedyooher—saved her!”yooyoo“You defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a great hurryyooabout everything,” Grushenka drawled again.yooyoo“Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to defend you?yooGrushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that charming soft littleyoohand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It has brought me happiness and hasyoolifted me up, and I’m going to kiss it, outside and inside, here, here,yoohere!”yooyooAnd three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather fat, handyooof Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand with a charmingyoomusical, nervous little laugh, watched the “sweet young lady,” andyooobviously liked having her hand kissed.yooyoo“Perhaps there’s rather too much rapture,” thought Alyosha. He blushed. Heyoofelt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.yooyoo“You won’t make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand like thisyoobefore Alexey Fyodorovitch.”yooyoo“Do you think I meant to make you blush?” said Katerina Ivanovna, somewhatyoosurprised. “Ah, my dear, how little you understand me!”yooyoo“Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young lady. MaybeyooI’m not so good as I seem to you. I’ve a bad heart; I will have my ownyooway. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun.”yooyoo“But now you’ll save him. You’ve given me your word. You’ll explain it allyooto him. You’ll break to him that you have long loved another man, who isyoonow offering you his hand.”yooyoo“Oh, no! I didn’t give you my word to do that. It was you kept talkingyooabout that. I didn’t give you my word.”yooyoo“Then I didn’t quite understand you,” said Katerina Ivanovna slowly,yooturning a little pale. “You promised—”yooyoo“Oh, no, angel lady, I’ve promised nothing,” Grushenka interrupted softlyyooand evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression. “You see atyooonce, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I am compared with you. If Iyoowant to do a thing I do it. I may have made you some promise just now. Butyoonow again I’m thinking: I may take to Mitya again. I liked him very muchyooonce—liked him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go and tell himyooto stay with me from this day forward. You see, I’m so changeable.”yooyoo“Just now you said—something quite different,” Katerina Ivanovna whisperedyoofaintly.yooyoo“Ah, just now! But, you know. I’m such a soft-hearted, silly creature.yooOnly think what he’s gone through on my account! What if when I go home Iyoofeel sorry for him? What then?”yooyoo“I never expected—”yooyoo“Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with me! Nowyooperhaps you won’t care for a silly creature like me, now you know myyoocharacter. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic lady,” she saidyootenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovna’s hand.yooyoo“Here, dear young lady, I’ll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine.yooYou kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours three hundred timesyooto be even with you. Well, but let that pass. And then it shall be as Godyoowills. Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want to do your biddingyoolike a slave. Let it be as God wills, without any agreements and promises.yooWhat a sweet hand—what a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, youyooincredible beauty!”yooyooShe slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object indeed ofyoo“being even” with her in kisses.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with timid hopeyooto the last words, though Grushenka’s promise to do her bidding like ayooslave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently into her eyes; sheyoostill saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted, confiding expression, theyoosame bright gayety.yooyoo“She’s perhaps too naïve,” thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a gleam ofyoohope.yooyooGrushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the “sweet hand.” She raisedyooit deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three minutes nearyooher lips, as though reconsidering something.yooyoo“Do you know, angel lady,” she suddenly drawled in an even more soft andyoosugary voice, “do you know, after all, I think I won’t kiss your hand?”yooAnd she laughed a little merry laugh.yooyoo“As you please. What’s the matter with you?” said Katerina Ivanovna,yoostarting suddenly.yooyoo“So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand, but I didn’tyookiss yours.”yooyooThere was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness atyooKaterina Ivanovna.yooyoo“Insolent creature!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly graspingyoosomething. She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat.yooyooGrushenka too got up, but without haste.yooyoo“So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn’t kiss yours atyooall. And how he will laugh!”yooyoo“Vile slut! Go away!”yooyoo“Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That’s unbecoming for you, dearyooyoung lady, a word like that.”yooyoo“Go away! You’re a creature for sale!” screamed Katerina Ivanovna. Everyyoofeature was working in her utterly distorted face.yooyoo“For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once;yooyou brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.”yooyooKaterina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but Alyosha heldyooher with all his strength.yooyoo“Not a step, not a word! Don’t speak, don’t answer her. She’ll goyooaway—she’ll go at once.”yooyooAt that instant Katerina Ivanovna’s two aunts ran in at her cry, and withyoothem a maid-servant. All hurried to her.yooyoo“I will go away,” said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the sofa.yoo“Alyosha, darling, see me home!”yooyoo“Go away—go away, make haste!” cried Alyosha, clasping his handsyooimploringly.yooyoo“Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I’ve got a pretty little story to tellyooyou on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha. See meyoohome, dear, you’ll be glad of it afterwards.”yooyooAlyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of the house,yoolaughing musically.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and was shakenyoowith convulsions. Every one fussed round her.yooyoo“I warned you,” said the elder of her aunts. “I tried to prevent youryoodoing this. You’re too impulsive. How could you do such a thing? You don’tyooknow these creatures, and they say she’s worse than any of them. You areyootoo self-willed.”yooyoo“She’s a tigress!” yelled Katerina Ivanovna. “Why did you hold me, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch? I’d have beaten her—beaten her!”yooyooShe could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did not care to,yooindeed.yooyoo“She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!”yooyooAlyosha withdrew towards the door.yooyoo“But, my God!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands. “He! He! Heyoocould be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he told that creature whatyoohappened on that fatal, accursed day! ‘You brought your beauty for sale,yoodear young lady.’ She knows it! Your brother’s a scoundrel, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch.”yooyooAlyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn’t find a word. His heartyooached.yooyoo“Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It’s shameful, it’s awful for me!yooTo-morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow. Don’t condemn me.yooForgive me. I don’t know what I shall do with myself now!”yooyooAlyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept as she did.yooSuddenly he was overtaken by the maid.yooyoo“The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame Hohlakov; it’syoobeen left with us since dinner-time.”yooyooAlyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it, almostyoounconsciously, into his pocket.yooyooyooyooChapter XI. Another Reputation RuinedyooyooyooIt was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the town to theyoomonastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that hour deserted.yooIt was almost night, and too dark to see anything clearly at thirty pacesyooahead. There were cross-roads half-way. A figure came into sight under ayoosolitary willow at the cross-roads. As soon as Alyosha reached theyoocross-roads the figure moved out and rushed at him, shouting savagely:yooyoo“Your money or your life!”yooyoo“So it’s you, Mitya,” cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startledyoohowever.yooyoo“Ha ha ha! You didn’t expect me? I wondered where to wait for you. By heryoohouse? There are three ways from it, and I might have missed you. At lastyooI thought of waiting here, for you had to pass here, there’s no other wayyooto the monastery. Come, tell me the truth. Crush me like a beetle. Butyoowhat’s the matter?”yooyoo“Nothing, brother—it’s the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri! Father’s bloodyoojust now.” (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on the verge of tears for ayoolong time, and now something seemed to snap in his soul.) “You almostyookilled him—cursed him—and now—here—you’re making jokes—‘Your money or youryoolife!’ ”yooyoo“Well, what of that? It’s not seemly—is that it? Not suitable in myyooposition?”yooyoo“No—I only—”yooyoo“Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what clouds, what ayoowind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting for you. And as God’syooabove, I suddenly thought, why go on in misery any longer, what is thereyooto wait for? Here I have a willow, a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twistyoothem into a rope in a minute, and braces besides, and why go on burdeningyoothe earth, dishonoring it with my vile presence? And then I heard youyoocoming—Heavens, it was as though something flew down to me suddenly. Soyoothere is a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man, my dear littleyoobrother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only one I loveyooin the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that moment that Iyoothought, ‘I’ll fall on his neck at once.’ Then a stupid idea struck me, toyoohave a joke with you and scare you. I shouted, like a fool, ‘Your money!’yooForgive my foolery—it was only nonsense, and there’s nothing unseemly inyoomy soul.... Damn it all, tell me what’s happened. What did she say? Strikeyoome, crush me, don’t spare me! Was she furious?”yooyoo“No, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. There—I found themyooboth there.”yooyoo“Both? Whom?”yooyoo“Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna’s.”yooyooDmitri was struck dumb.yooyoo“Impossible!” he cried. “You’re raving! Grushenka with her?”yooyooAlyosha described all that had happened from the moment he went in toyooKaterina Ivanovna’s. He was ten minutes telling his story. He can’t beyoosaid to have told it fluently and consecutively, but he seemed to make ityooclear, not omitting any word or action of significance, and vividlyyoodescribing, often in one word, his own sensations. Dmitri listened inyoosilence, gazing at him with a terrible fixed stare, but it was clear toyooAlyosha that he understood it all, and had grasped every point. But as theyoostory went on, his face became not merely gloomy, but menacing. Heyooscowled, he clenched his teeth, and his fixed stare became still moreyoorigid, more concentrated, more terrible, when suddenly, with incredibleyoorapidity, his wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed lipsyooparted, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneousyoolaughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time he could notyoospeak.yooyoo“So she wouldn’t kiss her hand! So she didn’t kiss it; so she ran away!”yoohe kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight it might haveyoobeen called, if it had not been so spontaneous. “So the other one calledyooher tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought to be flogged on ayooscaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. That’s just what I think; she ought toyoohave been long ago. It’s like this, brother, let her be punished, but Iyoomust get better first. I understand the queen of impudence. That’s her allyooover! You saw her all over in that hand-kissing, the she-devil! She’syoomagnificent in her own line! So she ran home? I’ll go—ah—I’ll run to her!yooAlyosha, don’t blame me, I agree that hanging is too good for her.”yooyoo“But Katerina Ivanovna!” exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.yooyoo“I see her, too! I see right through her, as I’ve never done before! It’syooa regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is, of theyoofive! What a thing to do! That’s just like Katya, who was not afraid toyooface a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly insult on a generousyooimpulse to save her father! But the pride, the recklessness, the defianceyooof fate, the unbounded defiance! You say that aunt tried to stop her? Thatyooaunt, you know, is overbearing, herself. She’s the sister of the general’syoowidow in Moscow, and even more stuck-up than she. But her husband wasyoocaught stealing government money. He lost everything, his estate and all,yooand the proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasn’t raised them since.yooSo she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn’t listen to her! She thinksyooshe can overcome everything, that everything will give way to her. Sheyoothought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and she believed ityooherself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault is it? Do you thinkyooshe kissed Grushenka’s hand first, on purpose, with a motive? No, sheyooreally was fascinated by Grushenka, that’s to say, not by Grushenka, butyooby her own dream, her own delusion—because it was _her_ dream, _her_yoodelusion! Alyosha, darling, how did you escape from them, those women? Didyooyou pick up your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!”yooyoo“Brother, you don’t seem to have noticed how you’ve insulted KaterinayooIvanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she flung it in her faceyoojust now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her beauty!yooBrother, what could be worse than that insult?”yooyooWhat worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as it seemed,yoohis brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna’s humiliation.yooyoo“Bah!” Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his hand. Heyooonly now realized it, though Alyosha had just told him of the insult, andyooKaterina Ivanovna’s cry: “Your brother is a scoundrel!”yooyoo“Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that ‘fatal day,’ asyooKatya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time atyooMokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was sobbing. I wasyoosobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya’s image, and Grushenkayoounderstood it. She understood it all then. I remember, she criedyooherself.... Damn it all! But it’s bound to be so now.... Then she cried,yoobut now ‘the dagger in the heart’! That’s how women are.”yooyooHe looked down and sank into thought.yooyoo“Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!” he said suddenly, in ayoogloomy voice. “It doesn’t matter whether I cried or not, I’m a scoundrel!yooTell her I accept the name, if that’s any comfort. Come, that’s enough.yooGood-by. It’s no use talking! It’s not amusing. You go your way and Iyoomine. And I don’t want to see you again except as a last resource.yooGood-by, Alexey!”yooyooHe warmly pressed Alyosha’s hand, and still looking down, without raisingyoohis head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly towards the town.yooyooAlyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away so abruptly.yooyoo“Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!” cried Dmitri, suddenlyyooturning back. “Look at me. Look at me well. You see here, here—there’syooterrible disgrace in store for me.” (As he said “here,” Dmitri struck hisyoochest with his fist with a strange air, as though the dishonor layyooprecisely on his chest, in some spot, in a pocket, perhaps, or hangingyooround his neck.) “You know me now, a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, butyoolet me tell you that I’ve never done anything before and never shallyooagain, anything that can compare in baseness with the dishonor which Iyoobear now at this very minute on my breast, here, here, which will come toyoopass, though I’m perfectly free to stop it. I can stop it or carry ityoothrough, note that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through. Iyooshan’t stop it. I told you everything just now, but I didn’t tell youyoothis, because even I had not brass enough for it. I can still pull up; ifyooI do, I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow. But Iyooshan’t pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear witnessyoothat I told you so beforehand. Darkness and destruction! No need toyooexplain. You’ll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley and theyooshe-devil. Good-by. Don’t pray for me, I’m not worth it. And there’s noyooneed, no need at all.... I don’t need it! Away!”yooyooAnd he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards theyoomonastery.yooyoo“What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?” he wonderedyoowildly. “Why, I shall certainly see him to-morrow. I shall look him up. Iyooshall make a point of it. What does he mean?”yooyoo                  -------------------------------------yooyooHe went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the hermitage.yooThe door was opened to him, though no one was admitted at that hour. Thereyoowas a tremor in his heart as he went into Father Zossima’s cell.yooyoo“Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the world? Here wasyoopeace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion, there was darkness inyoowhich one lost one’s way and went astray at once....”yooyooIn the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Païssy, who came everyyoohour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt with alarm that heyoowas getting worse and worse. Even his usual discourse with the brothersyoocould not take place that day. As a rule every evening after service theyoomonks flocked into Father Zossima’s cell, and all confessed aloud theiryoosins of the day, their sinful thoughts and temptations; even theiryoodisputes, if there had been any. Some confessed kneeling. The elderyooabsolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissedyoothem. It was against this general “confession” that the opponents ofyoo“elders” protested, maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacramentyooof confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a differentyoothing. They even represented to the diocesan authorities that suchyooconfessions attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led toyoosin and temptation. Many of the brothers disliked going to the elder, andyoowent against their own will because every one went, and for fear theyyooshould be accused of pride and rebellious ideas. People said that some ofyoothe monks agreed beforehand, saying, “I’ll confess I lost my temper withyooyou this morning, and you confirm it,” simply in order to have somethingyooto say. Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes. He knew, too,yoothat there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact thatyooletters from relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be openedyooand read by him before those to whom they were addressed.yooyooIt was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in goodyoofaith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance. But, in fact,yoothere was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was false andyoostrained in this practice. Yet the older and more experienced of the monksyooadhered to their opinion, arguing that “for those who have come withinyoothese walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and sacrifice willyoocertainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, whoyoofind it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake inyooentering the monastery—their proper place is in the world. Even in theyootemple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil. So it was no good takingyooit too much into account.”yooyoo“He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,” Father Païssy whispered toyooAlyosha, as he blessed him. “It’s difficult to rouse him. And he must notyoobe roused. He waked up for five minutes, sent his blessing to theyoobrothers, and begged their prayers for him at night. He intends to takeyoothe sacrament again in the morning. He remembered you, Alexey. He askedyoowhether you had gone away, and was told that you were in the town. ‘Iyooblessed him for that work,’ he said, ‘his place is there, not here, foryooawhile.’ Those were his words about you. He remembered you lovingly, withyooanxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how is it that he hasyoodecided that you shall spend some time in the world? He must have foreseenyoosomething in your destiny! Understand, Alexey, that if you return to theyooworld, it must be to do the duty laid upon you by your elder, and not foryoofrivolous vanity and worldly pleasures.”yooyooFather Païssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father Zossima wasyoodying, though he might live another day or two. Alyosha firmly andyooardently resolved that in spite of his promises to his father, theyooHohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not leave the monastery nextyooday, but would remain with his elder to the end. His heart glowed withyoolove, and he reproached himself bitterly for having been able for oneyooinstant to forget him whom he had left in the monastery on his deathbed,yooand whom he honored above every one in the world. He went into FatheryooZossima’s bedroom, knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder,yoowho slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathingyooand a peaceful face.yooyooAlyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had received hisyooguests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay down on the hard,yoonarrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used as a bed, bringing nothingyoobut a pillow. The mattress, about which his father had shouted to him thatyoomorning, he had long forgotten to lie on. He took off his cassock, whichyoohe used as a covering. But before going to bed, he fell on his knees andyooprayed a long time. In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God toyoolighten his darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, whichyooalways visited his soul after the praise and adoration, of which hisyooevening prayer usually consisted. That joy always brought him lightyoountroubled sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his pocket theyoolittle pink note the servant had handed him as he left KaterinayooIvanovna’s. He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then, after someyoohesitation, he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to him, signed byyooLise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at him beforeyoothe elder in the morning.yooyoo“Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she wrote, “I am writing to you without any one’syooknowledge, even mamma’s, and I know how wrong it is. But I cannot liveyoowithout telling you the feeling that has sprung up in my heart, and thisyoono one but us two must know for a time. But how am I to say what I want soyoomuch to tell you? Paper, they say, does not blush, but I assure you it’syoonot true and that it’s blushing just as I am now, all over. Dear Alyosha,yooI love you, I’ve loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, whenyooyou were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you all myyoolife. My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass them togetheryootill our old age. Of course, on condition that you will leave theyoomonastery. As for our age we will wait for the time fixed by the law. Byyoothat time I shall certainly be quite strong, I shall be walking andyoodancing. There can be no doubt of that.yooyoo“You see how I’ve thought of everything. There’s only one thing I can’tyooimagine: what you’ll think of me when you read this. I’m always laughingyooand being naughty. I made you angry this morning, but I assure you beforeyooI took up my pen, I prayed before the Image of the Mother of God, and nowyooI’m praying, and almost crying.yooyoo“My secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I don’t know how Iyooshall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if I can’t restrainyoomyself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as I did to-day. You’llyoothink I’m a nasty girl making fun of you, and you won’t believe my letter.yooAnd so I beg you, dear one, if you’ve any pity for me, when you comeyooto-morrow, don’t look me straight in the face, for if I meet your eyes, ityoowill be sure to make me laugh, especially as you’ll be in that long gown.yooI feel cold all over when I think of it, so when you come, don’t look atyoome at all for a time, look at mamma or at the window....yooyoo“Here I’ve written you a love-letter. Oh, dear, what have I done? Alyosha,yoodon’t despise me, and if I’ve done something very horrid and wounded you,yooforgive me. Now the secret of my reputation, ruined perhaps for ever, isyooin your hands.yooyoo“I shall certainly cry to-day. Good-by till our meeting, our _awful_yoomeeting.—LISE.yooyoo“P.S.—Alyosha! You must, must, must come!—LISE.”yooyooAlyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice, thought ayoolittle, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He started. That laughyooseemed to him sinful. But a minute later he laughed again just as softlyyooand happily. He slowly replaced the note in the envelope, crossed himselfyooand lay down. The agitation in his heart passed at once. “God, have mercyyooupon all of them, have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thyyookeeping, and set them in the right path. All ways are Thine. Save themyooaccording to Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou wilt send joy to all!”yooAlyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep.yooyooyooyooyooyooPART IIyooyooyooyooyooBook IV. LacerationsyooyooyooyooChapter I. Father FerapontyooyooyooAlyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima woke up feelingyoovery weak, though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a chair. Hisyoomind was quite clear; his face looked very tired, yet bright and almostyoojoyful. It wore an expression of gayety, kindness and cordiality. “Maybe Iyooshall not live through the coming day,” he said to Alyosha. Then heyoodesired to confess and take the sacrament at once. He always confessed toyooFather Païssy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unctionyoofollowed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled up by theyooinmates of the hermitage. Meantime it was daylight. People began comingyoofrom the monastery. After the service was over the elder desired to kissyooand take leave of every one. As the cell was so small the earlier visitorsyoowithdrew to make room for others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who wasyooseated again in his arm-chair. He talked as much as he could. Though hisyoovoice was weak, it was fairly steady.yooyoo“I’ve been teaching you so many years, and therefore I’ve been talkingyooaloud so many years, that I’ve got into the habit of talking, and so muchyooso that it’s almost more difficult for me to hold my tongue than to talk,yooeven now, in spite of my weakness, dear Fathers and brothers,” he jested,yoolooking with emotion at the group round him.yooyooAlyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them. Butyoothough he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady, his speechyoowas somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many things, he seemed anxiousyoobefore the moment of death to say everything he had not said in his life,yooand not simply for the sake of instructing them, but as though thirstingyooto share with all men and all creation his joy and ecstasy, and once moreyooin his life to open his whole heart.yooyoo“Love one another, Fathers,” said Father Zossima, as far as Alyosha couldyooremember afterwards. “Love God’s people. Because we have come here andyooshut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that areyoooutside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each ofyoous has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men onyooearth.... And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenlyyoohe must recognize that. Else he would have had no reason to come here.yooWhen he realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he isyooresponsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins,yoonational and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained.yooFor know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible foryooall men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulnessyooof creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individualyooman. This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man.yooFor monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought toyoobe. Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite,yoouniversal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the poweryooto win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the worldyoowith your tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confessyooyour sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even whenyooperceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions withyooGod. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to theyoogreat. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse andyooslander you. Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, theyoomaterialists—and I mean not only the good ones—for there are many goodyooones among them, especially in our day—hate not even the wicked ones.yooRemember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have noneyooto pray for them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is notyooin pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all men....yooLove God’s people, let not strangers draw away the flock, for if youyooslumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride, or worse still, inyoocovetousness, they will come from all sides and draw away your flock.yooExpound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ... be not extortionate....yooDo not love gold and silver, do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling toyoothe banner and raise it on high.”yooyooBut the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported his wordsyooafterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though to take breath,yooand recover his strength, but he was in a sort of ecstasy. They heard himyoowith emotion, though many wondered at his words and found them obscure....yooAfterwards all remembered those words.yooyooWhen Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was struck by theyoogeneral excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding about it.yooThis anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety, in others by devoutyoosolemnity. All were expecting that some marvel would happen immediatelyyooafter the elder’s death. Their suspense was, from one point of view,yooalmost frivolous, but even the most austere of the monks were affected byyooit. Father Païssy’s face looked the gravest of all.yooyooAlyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who hadyooarrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame Hohlakov. Inyooit she informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident. Ityooappeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receiveyooFather Zossima’s blessing, there had been an old woman from the town, ayoosergeant’s widow, called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she mightyoopray for the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone toyooIrkutsk, and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossimayoohad answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray foryoothe living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery. He afterwardsyooforgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, “as though reading theyoobook of the future” (this was Madame Hohlakov’s expression), words ofyoocomfort: “that her son Vassya was certainly alive and he would either comeyoohimself very shortly or send a letter, and that she was to go home andyooexpect him.” And “Would you believe it?” exclaimed Madame Hohlakovyooenthusiastically, “the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, andyoomore than that.” Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gaveyooher a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was notyooall; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassyayooinformed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, andyoothat three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped “to embrace hisyoomother.”yooyooMadame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new “miracle ofyooprediction” to the Superior and all the brotherhood. “All, all, ought toyooknow of it!” she concluded. The letter had been written in haste, theyooexcitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it. But Alyosha hadyoono need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already. Rakitin hadyoocommissioned the monk who brought his message “to inform most respectfullyyoohis reverence Father Païssy, that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak ofyoowith him, of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment, andyoohumbly begs forgiveness for his presumption.” As the monk had given theyoomessage to Father Païssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found afteryooreading the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it toyooFather Païssy in confirmation of the story.yooyooAnd even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as he read theyoonews of the “miracle,” could not completely restrain some inner emotion.yooHis eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came into his lips.yooyoo“We shall see greater things!” broke from him.yooyoo“We shall see greater things, greater things yet!” the monks aroundyoorepeated.yooyooBut Father Païssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least for ayootime, not to speak of the matter “till it be more fully confirmed, seeingyoothere is so much credulity among those of this world, and indeed thisyoomight well have chanced naturally,” he added, prudently, as it were toyoosatisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing his own disavowal, ayoofact his listeners very clearly perceived.yooyooWithin the hour the “miracle” was of course known to the whole monastery,yooand many visitors who had come for the mass. No one seemed more impressedyooby it than the monk who had come the day before from St. Sylvester, fromyoothe little monastery of Obdorsk in the far North. It was he who had beenyoostanding near Madame Hohlakov the previous day and had asked FatheryooZossima earnestly, referring to the “healing” of the lady’s daughter, “Howyoocan you presume to do such things?”yooyooHe was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe. The eveningyoobefore he had visited Father Ferapont in his cell apart, behind theyooapiary, and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit. ThisyooFather Ferapont was that aged monk so devout in fasting and observingyoosilence who has been mentioned already, as antagonistic to Father Zossimayooand the whole institution of “elders,” which he regarded as a perniciousyooand frivolous innovation. He was a very formidable opponent, although fromyoohis practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one. What made himyooformidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling, and manyyooof the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and ascetic, althoughyoothey had no doubt that he was crazy. But it was just his crazinessyooattracted them.yooyooFather Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived in theyoohermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and this tooyoobecause he behaved as though he were crazy. He was seventy-five or more,yooand he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying wooden cellyoowhich had been built long ago for another great ascetic, Father Iona, whoyoohad lived to be a hundred and five, and of whose saintly doings manyyoocurious stories were still extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.yooyooFather Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in this sameyoosolitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasant’s hut,yoothough it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary numberyooof ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them—which men brought toyoothe monastery as offerings to God. Father Ferapont had been appointed toyoolook after them and keep the lamps burning. It was said (and indeed it wasyootrue) that he ate only two pounds of bread in three days. The beekeeper,yoowho lived close by the apiary, used to bring him the bread every threeyoodays, and even to this man who waited upon him, Father Ferapont rarelyyoouttered a word. The four pounds of bread, together with the sacramentyoobread, regularly sent him on Sundays after the late mass by the FatheryooSuperior, made up his weekly rations. The water in his jug was changedyooevery day. He rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who came to do him homageyoosaw him sometimes kneeling all day long at prayer without looking round.yooIf he addressed them, he was brief, abrupt, strange, and almost alwaysyoorude. On very rare occasions, however, he would talk to visitors, but foryoothe most part he would utter some one strange saying which was a completeyooriddle, and no entreaties would induce him to pronounce a word inyooexplanation. He was not a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strangeyoobelief, chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont hadyoocommunication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with them, andyooso was silent with men.yooyooThe monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by theyoobeekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to the corneryoowhere Father Ferapont’s cell stood. “Maybe he will speak as you are ayoostranger and maybe you’ll get nothing out of him,” the beekeeper hadyoowarned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached in the utmostyooapprehension. It was rather late in the evening. Father Ferapont wasyoositting at the door of his cell on a low bench. A huge old elm was lightlyyoorustling overhead. There was an evening freshness in the air. The monkyoofrom Obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his blessing.yooyoo“Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?” said Father Ferapont. “Get up!”yooyooThe monk got up.yooyoo“Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come from?”yooyooWhat most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his strictyoofasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous old man. Heyoowas tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh and healthy face.yooThere was no doubt he still had considerable strength. He was of athleticyoobuild. In spite of his great age he was not even quite gray, and still hadyoovery thick hair and a full beard, both of which had once been black. Hisyooeyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent. He spokeyoowith a broad accent. He was dressed in a peasant’s long reddish coat ofyoocoarse convict cloth (as it used to be called) and had a stout rope roundyoohis waist. His throat and chest were bare. Beneath his coat, his shirt ofyoothe coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been changedyoofor months. They said that he wore irons weighing thirty pounds under hisyoocoat. His stockingless feet were thrust in old slippers almost dropping toyoopieces.yooyoo“From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,” the monk answeredyoohumbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather frightened little eyesyookept watch on the hermit.yooyoo“I have been at your Sylvester’s. I used to stay there. Is Sylvesteryoowell?”yooyooThe monk hesitated.yooyoo“You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?”yooyoo“Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During Lentyoothere are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. For Tuesdayyooand Thursday we have white bread, stewed fruit with honey, wild berries,yooor salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout. On Saturday white cabbage soup,yoonoodles with peas, kasha, all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have driedyoofish and kasha with the cabbage soup. From Monday till Saturday evening,yoosix whole days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread andyoowater, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just theyoosame as is ordered for first week in Lent. On Good Friday nothing isyooeaten. In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till three o’clock,yooand then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of wine. OnyooHoly Thursday we drink wine and have something cooked without oil or notyoocooked at all, inasmuch as the Laodicean council lays down for HolyyooThursday: ‘It is unseemly by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday toyoodishonor the whole of Lent!’ This is how we keep the fast. But what isyoothat compared with you, holy Father,” added the monk, growing moreyooconfident, “for all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing butyoobread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full seven.yooIt’s truly marvelous—your great abstinence.”yooyoo“And mushrooms?” asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.yooyoo“Mushrooms?” repeated the surprised monk.yooyoo“Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go away intoyoothe forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries, but they can’tyoogive up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage to the devil.yooNowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such fasting. Haughty andyoounclean is their judgment.”yooyoo“Och, true,” sighed the monk.yooyoo“And have you seen devils among them?” asked Ferapont.yooyoo“Among them? Among whom?” asked the monk, timidly.yooyoo“I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I haven’t beenyoosince. I saw a devil sitting on one man’s chest hiding under his cassock,yooonly his horns poked out; another had one peeping out of his pocket withyoosuch sharp eyes, he was afraid of me; another settled in the unclean bellyyooof one, another was hanging round a man’s neck, and so he was carrying himyooabout without seeing him.”yooyoo“You—can see spirits?” the monk inquired.yooyoo“I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming out fromyoothe Superior’s I saw one hiding from me behind the door, and a big one, ayooyard and a half or more high, with a thick long gray tail, and the tip ofyoohis tail was in the crack of the door and I was quick and slammed theyoodoor, pinching his tail in it. He squealed and began to struggle, and Iyoomade the sign of the cross over him three times. And he died on the spotyoolike a crushed spider. He must have rotted there in the corner and beyoostinking, but they don’t see, they don’t smell it. It’s a year since Iyoohave been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.”yooyoo“Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,” said the monk,yoogrowing bolder and bolder, “is it true, as they noise abroad even toyoodistant lands about you, that you are in continual communication with theyooHoly Ghost?”yooyoo“He does fly down at times.”yooyoo“How does he fly down? In what form?”yooyoo“As a bird.”yooyoo“The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?”yooyoo“There’s the Holy Ghost and there’s the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit canyooappear as other birds—sometimes as a swallow, sometimes a goldfinch andyoosometimes as a blue-tit.”yooyoo“How do you know him from an ordinary tit?”yooyoo“He speaks.”yooyoo“How does he speak, in what language?”yooyoo“Human language.”yooyoo“And what does he tell you?”yooyoo“Why, to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would ask meyoounseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.”yooyoo“Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,” the monk shookyoohis head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened little eyes.yooyoo“Do you see this tree?” asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.yooyoo“I do, blessed Father.”yooyoo“You think it’s an elm, but for me it has another shape.”yooyoo“What sort of shape?” inquired the monk, after a pause of vainyooexpectation.yooyoo“It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night it isyooChrist holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those arms, I see ityooclearly and tremble. It’s terrible, terrible!”yooyoo“What is there terrible if it’s Christ Himself?”yooyoo“Why, He’ll snatch me up and carry me away.”yooyoo“Alive?”yooyoo“In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven’t you heard? He will take me inyooHis arms and bear me away.”yooyooThough the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one of theyoobrothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished at heartyooa greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father Zossima. He wasyoostrongly in favor of fasting, and it was not strange that one who kept soyoorigid a fast as Father Ferapont should “see marvels.” His words seemedyoocertainly queer, but God only could tell what was hidden in those words,yooand were not worse words and acts commonly seen in those who haveyoosacrificed their intellects for the glory of God? The pinching of theyoodevil’s tail he was ready and eager to believe, and not only in theyoofigurative sense. Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strongyooprejudice against the institution of “elders,” which he only knew of byyoohearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before he had beenyoolong at the monastery, he had detected the secret murmurings of someyooshallow brothers who disliked the institution. He was, besides, ayoomeddlesome, inquisitive man, who poked his nose into everything. This wasyoowhy the news of the fresh “miracle” performed by Father Zossima reducedyoohim to extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how theiryooinquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting to and froyoofrom one group to another, listening and asking questions among the monksyoothat were crowding within and without the elder’s cell. But he did not payyoomuch attention to him at the time, and only recollected it afterwards.yooyooHe had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima, feelingyootired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of Alyosha as he was closingyoohis eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran at once. There was no one else inyoothe cell but Father Païssy, Father Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. Theyooelder, opening his weary eyes and looking intently at Alyosha, asked himyoosuddenly:yooyoo“Are your people expecting you, my son?”yooyooAlyosha hesitated.yooyoo“Haven’t they need of you? Didn’t you promise some one yesterday to seeyoothem to-day?”yooyoo“I did promise—to my father—my brothers—others too.”yooyoo“You see, you must go. Don’t grieve. Be sure I shall not die without youryoobeing by to hear my last word. To you I will say that word, my son, ityoowill be my last gift to you. To you, dear son, because you love me. Butyoonow go to keep your promise.”yooyooAlyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the promise thatyoohe should hear his last word on earth, that it should be the last gift toyoohim, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his soul. He made hasteyoothat he might finish what he had to do in the town and return quickly.yooFather Païssy, too, uttered some words of exhortation which moved andyoosurprised him greatly. He spoke as they left the cell together.yooyoo“Remember, young man, unceasingly,” Father Païssy began, without preface,yoo“that the science of this world, which has become a great power, has,yooespecially in the last century, analyzed everything divine handed down toyoous in the holy books. After this cruel analysis the learned of this worldyoohave nothing left of all that was sacred of old. But they have onlyyooanalyzed the parts and overlooked the whole, and indeed their blindness isyoomarvelous. Yet the whole still stands steadfast before their eyes, and theyoogates of hell shall not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteenyoocenturies, is it not still a living, a moving power in the individual soulyooand in the masses of people? It is still as strong and living even in theyoosouls of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who haveyoorenounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still followyoothe Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor ofyootheir hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtueyoothan the ideal given by Christ of old. When it has been attempted, theyooresult has been only grotesque. Remember this especially, young man, sinceyooyou are being sent into the world by your departing elder. Maybe,yooremembering this great day, you will not forget my words, uttered from theyooheart for your guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of theyooworld are great and beyond your strength to endure. Well, now go, myyooorphan.”yooyooWith these words Father Païssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the monasteryyooand thought them over, he suddenly realized that he had met a new andyoounexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in this austere monk who hadyoohitherto treated him sternly. It was as though Father Zossima hadyoobequeathed him to him at his death, and “perhaps that’s just what hadyoopassed between them,” Alyosha thought suddenly. The philosophicyooreflections he had just heard so unexpectedly testified to the warmth ofyooFather Païssy’s heart. He was in haste to arm the boy’s mind for conflictyoowith temptation and to guard the young soul left in his charge with theyoostrongest defense he could imagine.yooyooyooyooChapter II. At His Father’syooyooyooFirst of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered thatyoohis father had insisted the day before that he should come without hisyoobrother Ivan seeing him. “Why so?” Alyosha wondered suddenly. “Even if myyoofather has something to say to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Mostyoolikely in his excitement yesterday he meant to say something different,”yoohe decided. Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened theyoogarden gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge),yootold him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone out twoyoohours ago.yooyoo“And my father?”yooyoo“He is up, taking his coffee,” Marfa answered somewhat dryly.yooyooAlyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table wearingyooslippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself by lookingyoothrough some accounts, rather inattentively however. He was quite alone inyoothe house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out marketing. Though he had got upyooearly and was trying to put a bold face on it, he looked tired and weak.yooHis forehead, upon which huge purple bruises had come out during theyoonight, was bandaged with a red handkerchief; his nose too had swollenyooterribly in the night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches,yoogiving his whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look. The oldyooman was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he cameyooin.yooyoo“The coffee is cold,” he cried harshly; “I won’t offer you any. I’veyooordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don’t invite any oneyooto share it. Why have you come?”yooyoo“To find out how you are,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It’s all of no consequence.yooYou need not have troubled. But I knew you’d come poking in directly.”yooyooHe said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he got up andyoolooked anxiously in the looking-glass (perhaps for the fortieth time thatyoomorning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his red handkerchief moreyoobecomingly on his forehead.yooyoo“Red’s better. It’s just like the hospital in a white one,” he observedyoosententiously. “Well, how are things over there? How is your elder?”yooyoo“He is very bad; he may die to-day,” answered Alyosha. But his father hadyoonot listened, and had forgotten his own question at once.yooyoo“Ivan’s gone out,” he said suddenly. “He is doing his utmost to carry offyooMitya’s betrothed. That’s what he is staying here for,” he addedyoomaliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.yooyoo“Surely he did not tell you so?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three weeks ago?yooYou don’t suppose he too came to murder me, do you? He must have had someyooobject in coming.”yooyoo“What do you mean? Why do you say such things?” said Alyosha, troubled.yooyoo“He doesn’t ask for money, it’s true, but yet he won’t get a farthing fromyoome. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well know, my dearyooAlexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing, and the longer I live,yoothe more I shall need it,” he continued, pacing from one corner of theyooroom to the other, keeping his hands in the pockets of his loose greasyyooovercoat made of yellow cotton material. “I can still pass for a man atyoofive and fifty, but I want to pass for one for another twenty years. As Iyooget older, you know, I shan’t be a pretty object. The wenches won’t comeyooto me of their own accord, so I shall want my money. So I am saving upyoomore and more, simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You mayyooas well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell you.yooFor sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others do ityooon the sly, and I openly. And so all the other sinners fall upon me foryoobeing so simple. And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch, is not to myyootaste, let me tell you that; and it’s not the proper place for ayoogentleman, your paradise, even if it exists. I believe that I fall asleepyooand don’t wake up again, and that’s all. You can pray for my soul if youyoolike. And if you don’t want to, don’t, damn you! That’s my philosophy.yooIvan talked well here yesterday, though we were all drunk. Ivan is ayooconceited coxcomb, but he has no particular learning ... nor educationyooeither. He sits silent and smiles at one without speaking—that’s whatyoopulls him through.”yooyooAlyosha listened to him in silence.yooyoo“Why won’t he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself airs. YouryooIvan is a scoundrel! And I’ll marry Grushenka in a minute if I want to.yooFor if you’ve money, Alexey Fyodorovitch, you have only to want a thingyooand you can have it. That’s what Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch toyooprevent me getting married and that’s why he is egging on Mitya to marryyooGrushenka himself. He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as though Iyooshould leave him my money if I don’t marry her!). Besides if Mitya marriesyooGrushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that’s what he’syooreckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!”yooyoo“How cross you are! It’s because of yesterday; you had better lie down,”yoosaid Alyosha.yooyoo“There! you say that,” the old man observed suddenly, as though it hadyoostruck him for the first time, “and I am not angry with you. But if Ivanyoosaid it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you I have goodyoomoments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.”yooyoo“You are not ill-natured, but distorted,” said Alyosha with a smile.yooyoo“Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked up and Iyoodon’t know now what I shall decide about it. Of course in theseyoofashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a prejudice, butyooeven now the law does not allow you to drag your old father about by theyoohair, to kick him in the face in his own house, and brag of murdering himyoooutright—all in the presence of witnesses. If I liked, I could crush himyooand could have him locked up at once for what he did yesterday.”yooyoo“Then you don’t mean to take proceedings?”yooyoo“Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn’t care about Ivan, but there’s anotheryoothing.”yooyooAnd bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half-whisper.yooyoo“If I send the ruffian to prison, she’ll hear of it and run to see him atyooonce. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old man, within anyooinch of my life, she may give him up and come to me.... For that’s heryooway, everything by contraries. I know her through and through! Won’t youyoohave a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee and I’ll pour a quarter of ayooglass of brandy into it, it’s delicious, my boy.”yooyoo“No, thank you. I’ll take that roll with me if I may,” said Alyosha, andyootaking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket of his cassock.yoo“And you’d better not have brandy, either,” he suggested apprehensively,yoolooking into the old man’s face.yooyoo“You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them.yooOnly one little glass. I’ll get it out of the cupboard.”yooyooHe unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then locked theyoocupboard and put the key back in his pocket.yooyoo“That’s enough. One glass won’t kill me.”yooyoo“You see you are in a better humor now,” said Alyosha, smiling.yooyoo“Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I am ayooscoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya—why is that? He wants to spyyoohow much I give Grushenka if she comes. They are all scoundrels! But Iyoodon’t recognize Ivan, I don’t know him at all. Where does he come from? Heyoois not one of us in soul. As though I’d leave him anything! I shan’t leaveyooa will at all, you may as well know. And I’ll crush Mitya like a beetle. Iyoosquash black-beetles at night with my slipper; they squelch when you treadyooon them. And your Mitya will squelch too. _Your_ Mitya, for you love him.yooYes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him. But if Ivanyooloved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving him. But Ivan lovesyoonobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like Ivan are not our sort, my boy.yooThey are like a cloud of dust. When the wind blows, the dust will beyoogone.... I had a silly idea in my head when I told you to come to-day; Iyoowanted to find out from you about Mitya. If I were to hand him over ayoothousand or maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himselfyoooff altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and withoutyooGrushenka, and give her up once for all, eh?”yooyoo“I—I’ll ask him,” muttered Alyosha. “If you would give him three thousand,yooperhaps he—”yooyoo“That’s nonsense! You needn’t ask him now, no need! I’ve changed my mind.yooIt was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won’t give him anything, not a penny,yooI want my money myself,” cried the old man, waving his hand. “I’ll crushyoohim like a beetle without it. Don’t say anything to him or else he willyoobegin hoping. There’s nothing for you to do here, you needn’t stay. Isyoothat betrothed of his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has kept so carefullyyoohidden from me all this time, going to marry him or not? You went to seeyooher yesterday, I believe?”yooyoo“Nothing will induce her to abandon him.”yooyoo“There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and ayooscoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young ladies,yoovery different from—Ah, if I had his youth and the looks I had then (for Iyoowas better-looking than he at eight and twenty) I’d have been a conqueringyoohero just as he is. He is a low cad! But he shan’t have Grushenka, anyway,yoohe shan’t! I’ll crush him!”yooyooHis anger had returned with the last words.yooyoo“You can go. There’s nothing for you to do here to-day,” he snappedyooharshly.yooyooAlyosha went up to say good-by to him, and kissed him on the shoulder.yooyoo“What’s that for?” The old man was a little surprised. “We shall see eachyooother again, or do you think we shan’t?”yooyoo“Not at all, I didn’t mean anything.”yooyoo“Nor did I, I did not mean anything,” said the old man, looking at him.yoo“Listen, listen,” he shouted after him, “make haste and come again andyooI’ll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like to-day. Be sure toyoocome! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!”yooyooAnd as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the cupboardyooagain and poured out another half-glass.yooyoo“I won’t have more!” he muttered, clearing his throat, and again he lockedyoothe cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he went into his bedroom,yoolay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute he was asleep.yooyooyooyooChapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboysyooyooyoo“Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,” thought Alyosha, as heyooleft his father’s house and turned towards Madame Hohlakov’s, “or I mightyoohave to tell him of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.”yooyooAlyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewedyootheir energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again. “Father isyoospiteful and angry, he’s made some plan and will stick to it. And what ofyooDmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be spiteful andyooangry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I must succeed inyoofinding him to-day, whatever happens.”yooyooBut Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road,yoowhich, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression onyoohim. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming outyoointo Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the HighyooStreet (our whole town is intersected by ditches), he saw a group ofyooschoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They wereyoogoing home from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, othersyoowith leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others inyoolittle overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round theyooankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear. The wholeyoogroup was talking eagerly about something, apparently holding a council.yooAlyosha had never from his Moscow days been able to pass children withoutyootaking notice of them, and although he was particularly fond of childrenyooof three or thereabout, he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so,yooanxious as he was to-day, he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them.yooHe looked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all theyooboys had stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away,yoothere was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a satchel atyoohis side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking and withyoosparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and anxious watch on the otheryoosix, obviously his schoolfellows with whom he had just come out of school,yoobut with whom he had evidently had a feud.yooyooAlyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy in a blackyoojacket, observed:yooyoo“When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry it on myyooleft side, so as to have my right hand free, but you’ve got yours on youryooright side. So it will be awkward for you to get at it.”yooyooAlyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practicalyooremark. But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get at once intoyooconfidential relations with a child, or still more with a group ofyoochildren. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way so as to be on ayooperfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it by instinct.yooyoo“But he is left-handed,” another, a fine healthy-looking boy of eleven,yooanswered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.yooyoo“He even throws stones with his left hand,” observed a third.yooyooAt that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed theyooleft-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boyyoostanding the other side of the ditch.yooyoo“Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,” they all shouted. But Smurov, theyooleft-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged himself; he threwyooa stone, but it missed the boy and hit the ground. The boy the other sideyooof the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones,yooflung another stone at the group; this time it flew straight at Alyoshayooand hit him painfully on the shoulder.yooyoo“He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov, Karamazov!”yoothe boys shouted, laughing. “Come, all throw at him at once!” and sixyoostones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the head and he fell down,yoobut at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire. Bothyoosides threw stones incessantly. Many of the group had their pockets fullyootoo.yooyoo“What are you about! Aren’t you ashamed? Six against one! Why, you’ll killyoohim,” cried Alyosha.yooyooHe ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy. Threeyooor four ceased throwing for a minute.yooyoo“He began first!” cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice.yoo“He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day with ayoopenknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn’t tell tales, but he must beyoothrashed.”yooyoo“But what for? I suppose you tease him.”yooyoo“There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,” cried theyoochildren. “It’s you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all of you, atyoohim again, don’t miss, Smurov!” and again a fire of stones, and a veryyoovicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch was hit in theyoochest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill towards MihailovskyyooStreet. They all shouted: “Aha, he is funking, he is running away. Wisp ofyootow!”yooyoo“You don’t know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too good foryoohim,” said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He seemed to be theyooeldest.yooyoo“What’s wrong with him?” asked Alyosha, “is he a tell-tale or what?”yooyooThe boys looked at one another as though derisively.yooyoo“Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?” the same boy went on. “Catch himyooup.... You see he’s stopped again, he is waiting and looking at you.”yooyoo“He is looking at you,” the other boys chimed in.yooyoo“You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you hear, ask himyoothat!”yooyooThere was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them, and they atyoohim.yooyoo“Don’t go near him, he’ll hurt you,” cried Smurov in a warning voice.yooyoo“I shan’t ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease him withyoothat question somehow. But I’ll find out from him why you hate him so.”yooyoo“Find out then, find out,” cried the boys, laughing.yooyooAlyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence, straightyootowards the boy.yooyoo“You’d better look out,” the boys called after him; “he won’t be afraid ofyooyou. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did Krassotkin.”yooyooThe boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him, Alyosha sawyoofacing him a child of about nine years old. He was an undersized weaklyyooboy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at himyoovindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he hadyoomonstrously outgrown. His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves. Thereyoowas a large patch on the right knee of his trousers, and in his right bootyoojust at the toe there was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackenedyoowith ink. Both the pockets of his great-coat were weighed down withyoostones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly atyoohim. The boy, seeing at once from Alyosha’s eyes that he wouldn’t beatyoohim, became less defiant, and addressed him first.yooyoo“I am alone, and there are six of them. I’ll beat them all, alone!” heyoosaid suddenly, with flashing eyes.yooyoo“I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,” observed Alyosha.yooyoo“But I hit Smurov on the head!” cried the boy.yooyoo“They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me onyoopurpose,” said Alyosha.yooyooThe boy looked darkly at him.yooyoo“I don’t know you. Do you know me?” Alyosha continued.yooyoo“Let me alone!” the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as though heyoowere expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in hisyooeyes.yooyoo“Very well, I am going,” said Alyosha; “only I don’t know you and I don’tyootease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don’t want to tease you.yooGood-by!”yooyoo“Monk in silk trousers!” cried the boy, following Alyosha with the sameyoovindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself into an attitudeyooof defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him; but Alyoshayooturned, looked at him, and walked away. He had not gone three steps beforeyoothe biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in theyooback.yooyoo“So you’ll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they sayyoothat you attack on the sly,” said Alyosha, turning round again. This timeyoothe boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha’s face; but Alyosha justyoohad time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the elbow.yooyoo“Aren’t you ashamed? What have I done to you?” he cried.yooyooThe boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attackyoohim. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a little wildyoobeast’s; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move,yoothe spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit hisyoomiddle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten seconds before heyoolet go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his finger away with allyoohis might. The child let go at last and retreated to his former distance.yooAlyosha’s finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; ityoobegan to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it tightlyyooround his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stoodyoowaiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked atyoohim.yooyoo“Very well,” he said, “you see how badly you’ve bitten me. That’s enough,yooisn’t it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?”yooyooThe boy stared in amazement.yooyoo“Though I don’t know you and it’s the first time I’ve seen you,” Alyoshayoowent on with the same serenity, “yet I must have done something to you—youyoowouldn’t have hurt me like this for nothing. So what have I done? How haveyooI wronged you, tell me?”yooyooInstead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and ran away.yooAlyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky Street, and for a longyootime he saw the child running in the distance as fast as ever, not turningyoohis head, and no doubt still keeping up his tearful wail. He made up hisyoomind to find him out as soon as he had time, and to solve this mystery.yooJust now he had not the time.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. At The Hohlakovs’yooyooyooAlyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov’s house, a handsome stone house ofyootwo stories, one of the finest in our town. Though Madame Hohlakov spentyoomost of her time in another province where she had an estate, or inyooMoscow, where she had a house of her own, yet she had a house in our townyootoo, inherited from her forefathers. The estate in our district was theyoolargest of her three estates, yet she had been very little in our provinceyoobefore this time. She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.yooyoo“Did you get my letter about the new miracle?” She spoke rapidly andyoonervously.yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Did you show it to every one? He restored the son to his mother!”yooyoo“He is dying to-day,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or some one,yooabout all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am I can’t see him!yooThe whole town is in excitement, they are all suspense. But now—do youyooknow Katerina Ivanovna is here now?”yooyoo“Ah, that’s lucky,” cried Alyosha. “Then I shall see her here. She told meyooyesterday to be sure to come and see her to-day.”yooyoo“I know, I know all. I’ve heard exactly what happened yesterday—and theyooatrocious behavior of that—creature. _C’est tragique_, and if I’d been inyooher place I don’t know what I should have done. And your brother DmitriyooFyodorovitch, what do you think of him?—my goodness! Alexey Fyodorovitch,yooI am forgetting, only fancy; your brother is in there with her, not thatyoodreadful brother who was so shocking yesterday, but the other, IvanyooFyodorovitch, he is sitting with her talking; they are having a seriousyooconversation. If you could only imagine what’s passing between themyoonow—it’s awful, I tell you it’s lacerating, it’s like some incredible taleyooof horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see.yooThey both recognize it and revel in it. I’ve been watching for you! I’veyoobeen thirsting for you! It’s too much for me, that’s the worst of it. I’llyootell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of something else,yoothe most important thing—I had quite forgotten what’s most important. Tellyoome, why has Lise been in hysterics? As soon as she heard you were here,yooshe began to be hysterical!”yooyoo“_Maman_, it’s you who are hysterical now, not I,” Lise’s voice caroledyoothrough a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice sounded as thoughyooshe wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost to control it. Alyosha atyooonce noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise was peeping through it, but thatyoohe could not see.yooyoo“And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make me hystericalyootoo. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has been so ill allyoonight, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for the morning and foryooHerzenstube to come. He says that he can make nothing of it, that we mustyoowait. Herzenstube always comes and says that he can make nothing of it. Asyoosoon as you approached the house, she screamed, fell into hysterics, andyooinsisted on being wheeled back into this room here.”yooyoo“Mamma, I didn’t know he had come. It wasn’t on his account I wanted to beyoowheeled into this room.”yooyoo“That’s not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch wasyoocoming. She was on the look-out for you.”yooyoo“My darling mamma, it’s not at all clever of you. But if you want to makeyooup for it and say something very clever, dear mamma, you’d better tell ouryoohonored visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that he has shown his want of wit byyooventuring to us after what happened yesterday and although every one isyoolaughing at him.”yooyoo“Lise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who laughs atyoohim? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I can’t do without him. Oh,yooAlexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly unhappy!”yooyoo“But what’s the matter with you, mamma, darling?”yooyoo“Ah, your caprices, Lise, your fidgetiness, your illness, that awful nightyooof fever, that awful everlasting Herzenstube, everlasting, everlasting,yoothat’s the worst of it! Everything, in fact, everything.... Even thatyoomiracle, too! Oh, how it has upset me, how it has shattered me, thatyoomiracle, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch! And that tragedy in the drawing-room,yooit’s more than I can bear, I warn you. I can’t bear it. A comedy, perhaps,yoonot a tragedy. Tell me, will Father Zossima live till to-morrow, will he?yooOh, my God! What is happening to me? Every minute I close my eyes and seeyoothat it’s all nonsense, all nonsense.”yooyoo“I should be very grateful,” Alyosha interrupted suddenly, “if you couldyoogive me a clean rag to bind up my finger with. I have hurt it, and it’syoovery painful.”yooyooAlyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked with blood.yooMadame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.yooyoo“Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!”yooyooBut as soon as Lise saw Alyosha’s finger through the crack, she flung theyoodoor wide open.yooyoo“Come, come here,” she cried, imperiously. “No nonsense now! Good heavens,yoowhy did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time? He mightyoohave bled to death, mamma! How did you do it? Water, water! You must washyooit first of all, simply hold it in cold water to stop the pain, and keepyooit there, keep it there.... Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin.yooBut do make haste,” she finished nervously. She was quite frightened atyoothe sight of Alyosha’s wound.yooyoo“Shouldn’t we send for Herzenstube?” cried Madame Hohlakov.yooyoo“Mamma, you’ll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will come and say thatyoohe can make nothing of it! Water, water! Mamma, for goodness’ sake goyooyourself and hurry Yulia, she is such a slowcoach and never can comeyooquickly! Make haste, mamma, or I shall die.”yooyoo“Why, it’s nothing much,” cried Alyosha, frightened at this alarm.yooyooYulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.yooyoo“Some lint, mamma, for mercy’s sake, bring some lint and that muddyyoocaustic lotion for wounds, what’s it called? We’ve got some. You knowyoowhere the bottle is, mamma; it’s in your bedroom in the right-handyoocupboard, there’s a big bottle of it there with the lint.”yooyoo“I’ll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don’t scream and don’tyoofuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it. Where did you getyoosuch a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?”yooyooMadame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting for.yooyoo“First of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like this?” sheyooasked Alyosha, quickly. “And then I’ll talk to you about something quiteyoodifferent. Well?”yooyooInstinctively feeling that the time of her mother’s absence was preciousyoofor her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with theyooschoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise clasped her hands at hisyoostory.yooyoo“How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?” she criedyooangrily, as though she had a right to control him. “You are nothing but ayooboy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy! But you must find out foryoome about that horrid boy and tell me all about it, for there’s someyoomystery in it. Now for the second thing, but first a question: does theyoopain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things, but talkingyoosensibly?”yooyoo“Of course not, and I don’t feel much pain now.”yooyoo“That’s because your finger is in the water. It must be changed directly,yoofor it will get warm in a minute. Yulia, bring some ice from the cellaryooand another basin of water. Now she is gone, I can speak; will you give meyoothe letter I sent you yesterday, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch—be quick, foryoomamma will be back in a minute and I don’t want—”yooyoo“I haven’t got the letter.”yooyoo“That’s not true, you have. I knew you would say that. You’ve got it inyoothat pocket. I’ve been regretting that joke all night. Give me back theyooletter at once, give it me.”yooyoo“I’ve left it at home.”yooyoo“But you can’t consider me as a child, a little girl, after that sillyyoojoke! I beg your pardon for that silliness, but you must bring me theyooletter, if you really haven’t got it—bring it to-day, you must, you must.”yooyoo“To-day I can’t possibly, for I am going back to the monastery and Iyooshan’t come and see you for the next two days—three or four perhaps—foryooFather Zossima—”yooyoo“Four days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very much?”yooyoo“I didn’t laugh at all.”yooyoo“Why not?”yooyoo“Because I believed all you said.”yooyoo“You are insulting me!”yooyoo“Not at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would come toyoopass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the monastery.yooThen I shall go back and finish my studies, and when you reach the legalyooage we will be married. I shall love you. Though I haven’t had time toyoothink about it, I believe I couldn’t find a better wife than you, andyooFather Zossima tells me I must marry.”yooyoo“But I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair,” laughed Lise, flushingyoocrimson.yooyoo“I’ll wheel you about myself, but I’m sure you’ll get well by then.”yooyoo“But you are mad,” said Lise, nervously, “to make all this nonsense out ofyooa joke! Here’s mamma, very _à propos_, perhaps. Mamma, how slow you alwaysyooare, how can you be so long! And here’s Yulia with the ice!”yooyoo“Oh, Lise, don’t scream, above all things don’t scream. That scream drivesyoome ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place? I’ve beenyoohunting and hunting—I do believe you did it on purpose.”yooyoo“But I couldn’t tell that he would come with a bad finger, or else perhapsyooI might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma, you begin to say reallyyoowitty things.”yooyoo“Never mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling foryooAlexey Fyodorovitch’s sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, what’syookilling me is no one thing in particular, not Herzenstube, but everythingyootogether, that’s what is too much for me.”yooyoo“That’s enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube,” Lise laughed gayly.yoo“Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma. That’s simply Goulard’syoowater, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember the name now, but it’s a splendidyoolotion. Would you believe it, mamma, on the way here he had a fight withyoothe boys in the street, and it was a boy bit his finger, isn’t he a child,yooa child himself? Is he fit to be married after that? For only fancy, heyoowants to be married, mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn’t it beyoofunny, wouldn’t it be awful?”yooyooAnd Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly atyooAlyosha.yooyoo“But why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing? It’s quiteyooout of place—and perhaps the boy was rabid.”yooyoo“Why, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!”yooyoo“Why not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your boy might haveyoobeen bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one nearyoohim. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey Fyodorovitch! I couldn’t haveyoodone it. Do you still feel the pain?”yooyoo“It’s nothing much now.”yooyoo“You don’t feel afraid of water?” asked Lise.yooyoo“Come, that’s enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too quick talkingyooof the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at once Katerina Ivanovnayoohas only just heard that you are here, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she simplyyoorushed at me, she’s dying to see you, dying!”yooyoo“Ach, mamma, go to them yourself. He can’t go just now, he is in too muchyoopain.”yooyoo“Not at all, I can go quite well,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“What! You are going away? Is that what you say?”yooyoo“Well, when I’ve seen them, I’ll come back here and we can talk as much asyooyou like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at once, for I amyoovery anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as I can.”yooyoo“Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, don’t trouble to comeyooand see me afterwards, but go straight back to your monastery and a goodyooriddance. I want to sleep, I didn’t sleep all night.”yooyoo“Ah, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would sleep!” criedyooMadame Hohlakov.yooyoo“I don’t know what I’ve done.... I’ll stay another three minutes, five ifyooyou like,” muttered Alyosha.yooyoo“Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a monster.”yooyoo“Lise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is tooyoocapricious to-day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one has withyoonervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep after seeing you.yooHow quickly you have made her sleepy, and how fortunate it is!”yooyoo“Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it, mamma.”yooyoo“And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” Madame Hohlakovyoobegan mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid whisper. “I don’tyoowant to suggest anything, I don’t want to lift the veil, you will see foryooyourself what’s going on. It’s appalling. It’s the most fantastic farce.yooShe loves your brother, Ivan, and she is doing her utmost to persuadeyooherself she loves your brother, Dmitri. It’s appalling! I’ll go in withyooyou, and if they don’t turn me out, I’ll stay to the end.”yooyooyooyooChapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing-RoomyooyooyooBut in the drawing-room the conversation was already over. KaterinayooIvanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the momentyooAlyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to takeyooleave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. Foryoothis moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for someyootime haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several timesyoosuggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna,yooand, what was more, that he meant “to carry her off” from Dmitri. Untilyooquite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried himyooextremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such rivalry betweenyoothem. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he wasyooglad that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him,yooDmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But thatyooAlyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha hadyootill the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had ayoosteadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it tillyoothe evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of lovingyooa man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as heyoowas, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.yooyooBut during yesterday’s scene with Grushenka another idea had struck him.yooThe word “lacerating,” which Madame Hohlakov had just uttered, almost madeyoohim start, because half waking up towards daybreak that night he had criedyooout “Laceration, laceration,” probably applying it to his dream. He hadyoobeen dreaming all night of the previous day’s scene at KaterinayooIvanovna’s. Now Alyosha was impressed by Madame Hohlakov’s blunt andyoopersistent assertion that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, andyooonly deceived herself through some sort of pose, from “self-laceration,”yooand tortured herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fanciedyooduty of gratitude. “Yes,” he thought, “perhaps the whole truth lies inyoothose words.” But in that case what was Ivan’s position? Alyosha feltyooinstinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna’s must dominate, andyooshe could only dominate some one like Dmitri, and never a man like Ivan.yooFor Dmitri might at last submit to her domination “to his own happiness”yoo(which was what Alyosha would have desired), but Ivan—no, Ivan could notyoosubmit to her, and such submission would not give him happiness. Alyoshayoocould not help believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts andyooreflections flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room.yooAnother idea, too, forced itself upon him: “What if she loved neither ofyoothem—neither Ivan nor Dmitri?”yooyooIt must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own thoughtsyooand blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the last month.yoo“What do I know about love and women and how can I decide such questions?”yoohe thought reproachfully, after such doubts and surmises. And yet it wasyooimpossible not to think about it. He felt instinctively that this rivalryyoowas of immense importance in his brothers’ lives and that a great dealyoodepended upon it.yooyoo“One reptile will devour the other,” Ivan had pronounced the day before,yoospeaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan looked upon Dmitri asyooa reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was it perhaps since he had knownyooKaterina Ivanovna? That phrase had, of course, escaped Ivan unawaresyooyesterday, but that only made it more important. If he felt like that,yoowhat chance was there of peace? Were there not, on the contrary, newyoogrounds for hatred and hostility in their family? And with which of themyoowas Alyosha to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of them? Heyooloved them both, but what could he desire for each in the midst of theseyooconflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this maze, andyooAlyosha’s heart could not endure uncertainty, because his love was alwaysyooof an active character. He was incapable of passive love. If he loved anyyooone, he set to work at once to help him. And to do so he must know what heyoowas aiming at; he must know for certain what was best for each, and havingyooascertained this it was natural for him to help them both. But instead ofyooa definite aim, he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on allyoosides. “It was lacerating,” as was said just now. But what could heyoounderstand even in this “laceration”? He did not understand the first wordyooin this perplexing maze.yooyooSeeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to Ivan, whoyoohad already got up to go, “A minute! Stay another minute! I want to hearyoothe opinion of this person here whom I trust absolutely. Don’t go away,”yooshe added, addressing Madame Hohlakov. She made Alyosha sit down besideyooher, and Madame Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan.yooyoo“You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear friends,”yooshe began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine tears ofyoosuffering, and Alyosha’s heart warmed to her at once. “You, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable scene, and sawyoowhat I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he did. What he thoughtyooof me yesterday I don’t know. I only know one thing, that if it wereyoorepeated to-day, this minute, I should express the same feelings again asyooyesterday—the same feelings, the same words, the same actions. Youyooremember my actions, Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of them”yoo... (as she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone). “I must tell youyoothat I can’t get over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I don’t even knowyoowhether I still love _him_. I feel _pity_ for him, and that is a poor signyooof love. If I loved him, if I still loved him, perhaps I shouldn’t beyoosorry for him now, but should hate him.”yooyooHer voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes. Alyoshayooshuddered inwardly. “That girl is truthful and sincere,” he thought, “andyooshe does not love Dmitri any more.”yooyoo“That’s true, that’s true,” cried Madame Hohlakov.yooyoo“Wait, dear. I haven’t told you the chief, the final decision I came toyooduring the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a terrible one—foryoome, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to change it—nothing. Ityoowill be so all my life. My dear, kind, ever-faithful and generous adviser,yoothe one friend I have in the world, Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his deepyooinsight into the heart, approves and commends my decision. He knows it.”yooyoo“Yes, I approve of it,” Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.yooyoo“But I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive myyoocalling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch, too, toyootell me before my two friends whether I am right. I feel instinctivelyyoothat you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for you are a dear brother to me),”yooshe said again ecstatically, taking his cold hand in her hot one, “Iyooforesee that your decision, your approval, will bring me peace, in spiteyooof all my sufferings, for, after your words, I shall be calm and submit—Iyoofeel that.”yooyoo“I don’t know what you are asking me,” said Alyosha, flushing. “I onlyyooknow that I love you and at this moment wish for your happiness more thanyoomy own!... But I know nothing about such affairs,” something impelled himyooto add hurriedly.yooyoo“In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief thing isyoohonor and duty and something higher—I don’t know what—but higher perhapsyooeven than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible feeling in my heart,yooand it compels me irresistibly. But it may all be put in two words. I’veyooalready decided, even if he marries that—creature,” she began solemnly,yoo“whom I never, never can forgive, _even then I will not abandon him_.yooHenceforward I will never, never abandon him!” she cried, breaking into ayoosort of pale, hysterical ecstasy. “Not that I would run after himyoocontinually, get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go away toyooanother town—where you like—but I will watch over him all my life—I willyoowatch over him all my life unceasingly. When he becomes unhappy with thatyoowoman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let him come to me and heyoowill find a friend, a sister.... Only a sister, of course, and so foryooever; but he will learn at least that that sister is really his sister,yoowho loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him. I will gain myyoopoint. I will insist on his knowing me and confiding entirely in me,yoowithout reserve,” she cried, in a sort of frenzy. “I will be a god to whomyoohe can pray—and that, at least, he owes me for his treachery and for whatyooI suffered yesterday through him. And let him see that all my life I willyoobe true to him and the promise I gave him, in spite of his being untrueyooand betraying me. I will—I will become nothing but a means for hisyoohappiness, or—how shall I say?—an instrument, a machine for his happiness,yooand that for my whole life, my whole life, and that he may see that allyoohis life! That’s my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me.”yooyooShe was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea with moreyoodignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too hurried and crude. Ityoowas full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed that she was stillyoosmarting from yesterday’s insult, and that her pride craved satisfaction.yooShe felt this herself. Her face suddenly darkened, an unpleasant look cameyoointo her eyes. Alyosha at once saw it and felt a pang of sympathy. Hisyoobrother Ivan made it worse by adding:yooyoo“I’ve only expressed my own view,” he said. “From any one else, this wouldyoohave been affected and overstrained, but from you—no. Any other womanyoowould have been wrong, but you are right. I don’t know how to explain it,yoobut I see that you are absolutely genuine and, therefore, you are right.”yooyoo“But that’s only for the moment. And what does this moment stand for?yooNothing but yesterday’s insult.” Madame Hohlakov obviously had notyoointended to interfere, but she could not refrain from this very justyoocomment.yooyoo“Quite so, quite so,” cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviouslyyooannoyed at being interrupted, “in any one else this moment would be onlyyoodue to yesterday’s impression and would be only a moment. But withyooKaterina Ivanovna’s character, that moment will last all her life. Whatyoofor any one else would be only a promise is for her an everlastingyooburdensome, grim perhaps, but unflagging duty. And she will be sustainedyooby the feeling of this duty being fulfilled. Your life, Katerina Ivanovna,yoowill henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, youryooown heroism, and your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will beyoosoftened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment of ayoobold and proud design. Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate in anyyoocase, but a triumph for you. And the consciousness of it will at last be ayoosource of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everythingyooelse.”yooyooThis was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with intention;yooeven perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke ironically and withyoointention.yooyoo“Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!” Madame Hohlakov cried again.yooyoo“Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know what you willyoosay!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears. Alyosha got up fromyoothe sofa.yooyoo“It’s nothing, nothing!” she went on through her tears. “I’m upset, Iyoodidn’t sleep last night. But by the side of two such friends as you andyooyour brother I still feel strong—for I know—you two will never desert me.”yooyoo“Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow—perhaps to-morrow—and to leaveyooyou for a long time—And, unluckily, it’s unavoidable,” Ivan said suddenly.yooyoo“To-morrow—to Moscow!” her face was suddenly contorted; “but—but, dear me,yoohow fortunate!” she cried in a voice suddenly changed. In one instantyoothere was no trace left of her tears. She underwent an instantaneousyootransformation, which amazed Alyosha. Instead of a poor, insulted girl,yooweeping in a sort of “laceration,” he saw a woman completelyyooself-possessed and even exceedingly pleased, as though something agreeableyoohad just happened.yooyoo“Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,” she correctedyooherself suddenly, with a charming society smile. “Such a friend as you areyoocould not suppose that. I am only too unhappy at losing you.” She rushedyooimpulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his hands, pressed them warmly. “Butyoowhat is fortunate is that you will be able in Moscow to see auntie andyooAgafya and to tell them all the horror of my present position. You canyoospeak with complete openness to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You willyooknow how to do that. You can’t think how wretched I was yesterday and thisyoomorning, wondering how I could write them that dreadful letter—for one canyoonever tell such things in a letter.... Now it will be easy for me toyoowrite, for you will see them and explain everything. Oh, how glad I am!yooBut I am only glad of that, believe me. Of course, no one can take youryooplace.... I will run at once to write the letter,” she finished suddenly,yooand took a step as though to go out of the room.yooyoo“And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so desperatelyyooanxious to hear?” cried Madame Hohlakov. There was a sarcastic, angry noteyooin her voice.yooyoo“I had not forgotten that,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to a suddenyoostandstill, “and why are you so antagonistic at such a moment?” she added,yoowith warm and bitter reproachfulness. “What I said, I repeat. I must haveyoohis opinion. More than that, I must have his decision! As he says, so ityooshall be. You see how anxious I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch....yooBut what’s the matter?”yooyoo“I couldn’t have believed it. I can’t understand it!” Alyosha criedyoosuddenly in distress.yooyoo“What? What?”yooyoo“He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You said thatyooon purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not glad of that butyoosorry to be—losing a friend. But that was acting, too—you were playing ayoopart—as in a theater!”yooyoo“In a theater? What? What do you mean?” exclaimed Katerina Ivanovna,yooprofoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.yooyoo“Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him, you persistyooin telling him to his face that it’s fortunate he is going,” said Alyoshayoobreathlessly. He was standing at the table and did not sit down.yooyoo“What are you talking about? I don’t understand.”yooyoo“I don’t understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ... I know I amyoonot saying it properly, but I’ll say it all the same,” Alyosha went on inyoothe same shaking and broken voice. “What I see is that perhaps you don’tyoolove Dmitri at all ... and never have, from the beginning.... And Dmitri,yootoo, has never loved you ... and only esteems you.... I really don’t knowyoohow I dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... foryoonobody here will tell the truth.”yooyoo“What truth?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical ring inyooher voice.yooyoo“I’ll tell you,” Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though he wereyoojumping from the top of a house. “Call Dmitri; I will fetch him—and letyoohim come here and take your hand and take Ivan’s and join your hands. Foryooyou’re torturing Ivan, simply because you love him—and torturing him,yoobecause you love Dmitri through ‘self-laceration’—with an unrealyoolove—because you’ve persuaded yourself.”yooyooAlyosha broke off and was silent.yooyoo“You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot—that’s what you are!”yooKaterina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips were movingyoowith anger.yooyooIvan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.yooyoo“You are mistaken, my good Alyosha,” he said, with an expression Alyoshayoohad never seen in his face before—an expression of youthful sincerity andyoostrong, irresistibly frank feeling. “Katerina Ivanovna has never cared foryoome! She has known all the time that I cared for her—though I never said ayooword of my love to her—she knew, but she didn’t care for me. I have neveryoobeen her friend either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need myyoofriendship. She kept me at her side as a means of revenge. She revengedyoowith me and on me all the insults which she has been continually receivingyoofrom Dmitri ever since their first meeting. For even that first meetingyoohas rankled in her heart as an insult—that’s what her heart is like! Sheyoohas talked to me of nothing but her love for him. I am going now; but,yoobelieve me, Katerina Ivanovna, you really love him. And the more heyooinsults you, the more you love him—that’s your ‘laceration.’ You love himyoojust as he is; you love him for insulting you. If he reformed, you’d giveyoohim up at once and cease to love him. But you need him so as toyoocontemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him foryooinfidelity. And it all comes from your pride. Oh, there’s a great deal ofyoohumiliation and self-abasement about it, but it all comes from pride.... Iyooam too young and I’ve loved you too much. I know that I ought not to sayyoothis, that it would be more dignified on my part simply to leave you, andyooit would be less offensive for you. But I am going far away, and shallyoonever come back.... It is for ever. I don’t want to sit beside ayoo‘laceration.’... But I don’t know how to speak now. I’ve saidyooeverything.... Good-by, Katerina Ivanovna; you can’t be angry with me, foryooI am a hundred times more severely punished than you, if only by the factyoothat I shall never see you again. Good-by! I don’t want your hand. Youyoohave tortured me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at thisyoomoment. I shall forgive you later, but now I don’t want your hand. ‘DenyooDank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,’ ” he added, with a forced smile, showing,yoohowever, that he could read Schiller, and read him till he knew him byyooheart—which Alyosha would never have believed. He went out of the roomyoowithout saying good-by even to his hostess, Madame Hohlakov. Alyoshayooclasped his hands.yooyoo“Ivan!” he cried desperately after him. “Come back, Ivan! No, nothing willyooinduce him to come back now!” he cried again, regretfully realizing it;yoo“but it’s my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan spoke angrily, wrongly.yooUnjustly and angrily. He must come back here, come back,” Alyosha keptyooexclaiming frantically.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.yooyoo“You have done no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an angel,” MadameyooHohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to Alyosha. “I will do myyooutmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from going.”yooyooHer face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha, butyooKaterina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred-rouble notes inyooher hand.yooyoo“I have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she began,yooaddressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice, as thoughyoonothing had happened. “A week—yes, I think it was a week ago—DmitriyooFyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust action—a very ugly action.yooThere is a low tavern here, and in it he met that discharged officer, thatyoocaptain, whom your father used to employ in some business. DmitriyooFyodorovitch somehow lost his temper with this captain, seized him by theyoobeard and dragged him out into the street and for some distance along it,yooin that insulting fashion. And I am told that his son, a boy, quite ayoochild, who is at the school here, saw it and ran beside them crying andyoobegging for his father, appealing to every one to defend him, while everyyooone laughed. You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot thinkyoowithout indignation of that disgraceful action of _his_ ... one of thoseyooactions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his angeryoo... and in his passions! I can’t describe it even.... I can’t find myyoowords. I’ve made inquiries about his victim, and find he is quite a pooryooman. His name is Snegiryov. He did something wrong in the army and wasyoodischarged. I can’t tell you what. And now he has sunk into terribleyoodestitution, with his family—an unhappy family of sick children, and, Iyoobelieve, an insane wife. He has been living here a long time; he used toyoowork as a copying clerk, but now he is getting nothing. I thought if youyoo... that is I thought ... I don’t know. I am so confused. You see, Iyoowanted to ask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, to go to him, to find someyooexcuse to go to them—I mean to that captain—oh, goodness, how badly Iyooexplain it!—and delicately, carefully, as only you know how to” (Alyoshayooblushed), “manage to give him this assistance, these two hundred roubles.yooHe will be sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him to take it.... Or,yoorather, what do I mean? You see it’s not by way of compensation to preventyoohim from taking proceedings (for I believe he meant to), but simply ayootoken of sympathy, of a desire to assist him from me, DmitriyooFyodorovitch’s betrothed, not from himself.... But you know.... I would goyoomyself, but you’ll know how to do it ever so much better. He lives in LakeyooStreet, in the house of a woman called Kalmikov.... For God’s sake, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch, do it for me, and now ... now I am rather ... tired.yooGood-by!”yooyooShe turned and disappeared behind the portière so quickly that Alyosha hadyoonot time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak. He longed to beg heryoopardon, to blame himself, to say something, for his heart was full and heyoocould not bear to go out of the room without it. But Madame Hohlakov tookyoohim by the hand and drew him along with her. In the hall she stopped himyooagain as before.yooyoo“She is proud, she is struggling with herself; but kind, charming,yoogenerous,” she exclaimed, in a half-whisper. “Oh, how I love her,yooespecially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything! Dear AlexeyyooFyodorovitch, you didn’t know, but I must tell you, that we all, all—bothyooher aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even—have been hoping and praying foryoonothing for the last month but that she may give up your favorite Dmitri,yoowho takes no notice of her and does not care for her, and may marry IvanyooFyodorovitch—such an excellent and cultivated young man, who loves heryoomore than anything in the world. We are in a regular plot to bring ityooabout, and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.”yooyoo“But she has been crying—she has been wounded again,” cried Alyosha.yooyoo“Never trust a woman’s tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never for theyoowomen in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.”yooyoo“Mamma, you are spoiling him,” Lise’s little voice cried from behind theyoodoor.yooyoo“No, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,” Alyosha repeatedyoounconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for hisyooindiscretion.yooyoo“Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am readyyooto say so a thousand times over.”yooyoo“Mamma, how has he behaved like an angel?” Lise’s voice was heard again.yooyoo“I somehow fancied all at once,” Alyosha went on as though he had notyooheard Lise, “that she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid thing.... Whatyoowill happen now?”yooyoo“To whom, to whom?” cried Lise. “Mamma, you really want to be the death ofyoome. I ask you and you don’t answer.”yooyooAt the moment the maid ran in.yooyoo“Katerina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ... hysterics.”yooyoo“What is the matter?” cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety. “Mamma, Iyooshall be having hysterics, and not she!”yooyoo“Lise, for mercy’s sake, don’t scream, don’t persecute me. At your age oneyoocan’t know everything that grown-up people know. I’ll come and tell youyooeverything you ought to know. Oh, mercy on us! I am coming, I amyoocoming.... Hysterics is a good sign, Alexey Fyodorovitch; it’s anyooexcellent thing that she is hysterical. That’s just as it ought to be. Inyoosuch cases I am always against the woman, against all these feminine tearsyooand hysterics. Run and say, Yulia, that I’ll fly to her. As for IvanyooFyodorovitch’s going away like that, it’s her own fault. But he won’t goyooaway. Lise, for mercy’s sake, don’t scream! Oh, yes; you are notyooscreaming. It’s I am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted,yoodelighted, delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, howyooyoung Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he said allyoothat and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a _savant_, and allyooof a sudden he behaved so warmly, openly, and youthfully, with suchyooyouthful inexperience, and it was all so fine, like you.... And the way heyoorepeated that German verse, it was just like you! But I must fly, I mustyoofly! Alexey Fyodorovitch, make haste to carry out her commission, and thenyoomake haste back. Lise, do you want anything now? For mercy’s sake, don’tyookeep Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He will come back to you at once.”yooyooMadame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would have openedyoothe door to see Lise.yooyoo“On no account,” cried Lise. “On no account now. Speak through the door.yooHow have you come to be an angel? That’s the only thing I want to know.”yooyoo“For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good-by!”yooyoo“Don’t dare to go away like that!” Lise was beginning.yooyoo“Lise, I have a real sorrow! I’ll be back directly, but I have a great,yoogreat sorrow!”yooyooAnd he ran out of the room.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. A Laceration In The CottageyooyooyooHe certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been before. He hadyoorushed in like a fool, and meddled in what? In a love-affair. “But what doyooI know about it? What can I tell about such things?” he repeated toyoohimself for the hundredth time, flushing crimson. “Oh, being ashamed wouldyoobe nothing; shame is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shallyoocertainly have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me toyooreconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring themyootogether?” Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join theiryoohands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. “Though I acted quiteyoosincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,” he concluded suddenly,yooand did not even smile at his conclusion.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna’s commission took him to Lake Street, and his brotheryooDmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street. Alyosha decided toyoogo to him in any case before going to the captain, though he had ayoopresentiment that he would not find his brother. He suspected that heyoowould intentionally keep out of his way now, but he must find him anyhow.yooTime was passing: the thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha foryooone minute from the time he set off from the monastery.yooyooThere was one point which interested him particularly about KaterinayooIvanovna’s commission; when she had mentioned the captain’s son, theyoolittle schoolboy who had run beside his father crying, the idea had atyooonce struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten hisyoofinger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had done to hurt him. NowyooAlyosha felt practically certain of this, though he could not have saidyoowhy. Thinking of another subject was a relief, and he resolved to think noyoomore about the “mischief” he had done, and not to torture himself withyooremorse, but to do what he had to do, let come what would. At that thoughtyoohe was completely comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, heyoofelt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought from hisyoofather’s, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.yooyooDmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker, hisyooson, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at Alyosha. “Heyoohasn’t slept here for the last three nights. Maybe he has gone away,” theyooold man said in answer to Alyosha’s persistent inquiries. Alyosha saw thatyoohe was answering in accordance with instructions. When he asked whether heyoowere not at Grushenka’s or in hiding at Foma’s (Alyosha spoke so freely onyoopurpose), all three looked at him in alarm. “They are fond of him, theyyooare doing their best for him,” thought Alyosha. “That’s good.”yooyooAt last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little house,yoosunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street, and with ayoomuddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary cow. He crossed theyooyard and found the door opening into the passage. On the left of theyoopassage lived the old woman of the house with her old daughter. Bothyooseemed to be deaf. In answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain, oneyooof them at last understood that he was asking for their lodgers, andyoopointed to a door across the passage. The captain’s lodging turned out toyoobe a simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to openyoothe door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew fromyooKaterina Ivanovna’s words that the man had a family. “Either they are allyooasleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to openyoothe door. I’d better knock first,” and he knocked. An answer came, but notyooat once, after an interval of perhaps ten seconds.yooyoo“Who’s there?” shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.yooyooThen Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He found himselfyooin a regular peasant’s room. Though it was large, it was cumbered up withyoodomestic belongings of all sorts, and there were several people in it. Onyoothe left was a large Russian stove. From the stove to the window on theyooleft was a string running across the room, and on it there were ragsyoohanging. There was a bedstead against the wall on each side, right andyooleft, covered with knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid ofyoofour print-covered pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On theyooother there was only one very small pillow. The opposite corner wasyooscreened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this curtainyoocould be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair. The rough square tableyooof plain wood had been moved into the middle window. The three windows,yoowhich consisted each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes, gave littleyoolight, and were close shut, so that the room was not very light and ratheryoostuffy. On the table was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs,yooa half-eaten piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.yooyooA woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was sitting on ayoochair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and yellow, and her sunkenyoocheeks betrayed at the first glance that she was ill. But what struckyooAlyosha most was the expression in the poor woman’s eyes—a look ofyoosurprised inquiry and yet of haughty pride. And while he was talking toyooher husband, her big brown eyes moved from one speaker to the other withyoothe same haughty and questioning expression. Beside her at the windowyoostood a young girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly butyoovery neatly dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he came in.yooBeside the other bed was sitting another female figure. She was a very sadyoosight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled “withyoowithered legs,” as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her crutches stood in theyoocorner close by. The strikingly beautiful and gentle eyes of this pooryoogirl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man of forty-five was sittingyooat the table, finishing the fried eggs. He was spare, small and weaklyyoobuilt. He had reddish hair and a scanty light-colored beard, very muchyoolike a wisp of tow (this comparison and the phrase “a wisp of tow” flashedyooat once into Alyosha’s mind for some reason, he remembered it afterwards).yooIt was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him, as there was noyooother man in the room. But when Alyosha went in, he leapt up from theyoobench on which he was sitting, and, hastily wiping his mouth with a raggedyoonapkin, darted up to Alyosha.yooyoo“It’s a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to come to!” theyoogirl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man spun round instantlyyootowards her and answered her in an excited and breaking voice:yooyoo“No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,” he turned again to Alyosha,yoo“what has brought you to—our retreat?”yooyooAlyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had seen him.yooThere was something angular, flurried and irritable about him. Though heyoohad obviously just been drinking, he was not drunk. There wasyooextraordinary impudence in his expression, and yet, strange to say, at theyoosame time there was fear. He looked like a man who had long been kept inyoosubjection and had submitted to it, and now had suddenly turned and wasyootrying to assert himself. Or, better still, like a man who wantsyoodreadfully to hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him. In hisyoowords and in the intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazyyoohumor, at times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shiftingyoofrom one tone to another. The question about “our retreat” he had asked asyooit were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping up so close toyooAlyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was dressed in a veryyooshabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore checked trousers ofyooan extremely light color, long out of fashion, and of very thin material.yooThey were so crumpled and so short that he looked as though he had grownyooout of them like a boy.yooyoo“I am Alexey Karamazov,” Alyosha began in reply.yooyoo“I quite understand that, sir,” the gentleman snapped out at once toyooassure him that he knew who he was already. “I am Captain Snegiryov, sir,yoobut I am still desirous to know precisely what has led you—”yooyoo“Oh, I’ve come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with you—ifyooonly you allow me.”yooyoo“In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That’s what theyyooused to say in the old comedies, ‘kindly be seated,’ ” and with a rapidyoogesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden chair, notyooupholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of the room; then,yootaking another similar chair for himself, he sat down facing Alyosha, soyooclose to him that their knees almost touched.yooyoo“Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russianyooinfantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though I mightyoonot be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my life I’veyoolearnt to say ‘sir.’ It’s a word you use when you’ve come down in theyooworld.”yooyoo“That’s very true,” smiled Alyosha. “But is it used involuntarily or onyoopurpose?”yooyoo“As God’s above, it’s involuntary, and I usen’t to use it! I didn’t useyoothe word ‘sir’ all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water I beganyooto say ‘sir.’ It’s the work of a higher power. I see you are interested inyoocontemporary questions, but how can I have excited your curiosity, livingyooas I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise of hospitality?”yooyoo“I’ve come—about that business.”yooyoo“About what business?” the captain interrupted impatiently.yooyoo“About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Alyosha blurtedyooout awkwardly.yooyoo“What meeting, sir? You don’t mean that meeting? About my ‘wisp of tow,’yoothen?” He moved closer so that his knees positively knocked againstyooAlyosha. His lips were strangely compressed like a thread.yooyoo“What wisp of tow?” muttered Alyosha.yooyoo“He is come to complain of me, father!” cried a voice familiar toyooAlyosha—the voice of the schoolboy—from behind the curtain. “I bit hisyoofinger just now.” The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw his assailantyoolying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corneryoounder the ikons. The boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded quilt.yooHe was evidently unwell, and, judging by his glittering eyes, he was in ayoofever. He looked at Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he was at homeyooand could not be touched.yooyoo“What! Did he bite your finger?” The captain jumped up from his chair.yoo“Was it your finger he bit?”yooyoo“Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There were six of themyooagainst him alone. I went up to him, and he threw a stone at me and thenyooanother at my head. I asked him what I had done to him. And then he rushedyooat me and bit my finger badly, I don’t know why.”yooyoo“I’ll thrash him, sir, at once—this minute!” The captain jumped up fromyoohis seat.yooyoo“But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ... I don’t wantyoohim to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.”yooyoo“And do you suppose I’d thrash him? That I’d take my Ilusha and thrash himyoobefore you for your satisfaction? Would you like it done at once, sir?”yoosaid the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha, as though he were going toyooattack him. “I am sorry about your finger, sir; but instead of thrashingyooIlusha, would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife hereyoobefore your eyes to satisfy your just wrath? I should think four fingersyoowould be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance. You won’t ask foryoothe fifth one too?” He stopped short with a catch in his throat. Everyyoofeature in his face was twitching and working; he looked extremelyyoodefiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.yooyoo“I think I understand it all now,” said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully,yoostill keeping his seat. “So your boy is a good boy, he loves his father,yooand he attacked me as the brother of your assailant.... Now I understandyooit,” he repeated thoughtfully. “But my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regretsyoohis action, I know that, and if only it is possible for him to come toyooyou, or better still, to meet you in that same place, he will ask youryooforgiveness before every one—if you wish it.”yooyoo“After pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my forgiveness? And heyoothinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesn’t he?”yooyoo“Oh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in any way youyoolike.”yooyoo“So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me inyoothat very tavern—‘The Metropolis’ it’s called—or in the market-place, heyoowould do it?”yooyoo“Yes, he would even go down on his knees.”yooyoo“You’ve pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears and pierced meyooto the heart! I am only too sensible of your brother’s generosity. Allowyoome to introduce my family, my two daughters and my son—my litter. If Iyoodie, who will care for them, and while I live who but they will care for ayoowretch like me? That’s a great thing the Lord has ordained for every manyooof my sort, sir. For there must be some one able to love even a man likeyoome.”yooyoo“Ah, that’s perfectly true!” exclaimed Alyosha.yooyoo“Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and you put us toyooshame!” cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning to her father withyooa disdainful and contemptuous air.yooyoo“Wait a little, Varvara!” cried her father, speaking peremptorily butyoolooking at her quite approvingly. “That’s her character,” he said,yooaddressing Alyosha again.yooyooyoo    “And in all nature there was naughtyoo    That could find favor in his eyes—yooyooyooor rather in the feminine: that could find favor in her eyes. But now letyoome present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled, she isyooforty-three; she can move, but very little. She is of humble origin. ArinayooPetrovna, compose your countenance. This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.yooGet up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.” He took him by the hand and with unexpectedyooforce pulled him up. “You must stand up to be introduced to a lady. It’syoonot the Karamazov, mamma, who ... h’m ... etcetera, but his brother,yooradiant with modest virtues. Come, Arina Petrovna, come, mamma, first youryoohand to be kissed.”yooyooAnd he kissed his wife’s hand respectfully and even tenderly. The girl atyoothe window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an expression ofyooextraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of theyoowoman.yooyoo“Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,” she said.yooyoo“Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin,” he whisperedyooagain.yooyoo“Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think ofyooTchernomazov.... Sit down. Why has he pulled you up? He calls me crippled,yoobut I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels, and I am shriveled upyoomyself. Once I used to be so fat, but now it’s as though I had swallowed ayooneedle.”yooyoo“We are of humble origin,” the captain muttered again.yooyoo“Oh, father, father!” the hunchback girl, who had till then been silent onyooher chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief.yooyoo“Buffoon!” blurted out the girl at the window.yooyoo“Have you heard our news?” said the mother, pointing at her daughters.yoo“It’s like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we have music again.yooWhen we were with the army, we used to have many such guests. I don’t meanyooto make any comparisons; every one to their taste. The deacon’s wife usedyooto come then and say, ‘Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblestyooheart, but Nastasya Petrovna,’ she would say, ‘is of the brood of hell.’yoo‘Well,’ I said, ‘that’s a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.’yoo‘And you want keeping in your place,’ says she. ‘You black sword,’ said I,yoo‘who asked you to teach me?’ ‘But my breath,’ says she, ‘is clean, andyooyours is unclean.’ ‘You ask all the officers whether my breath isyoounclean.’ And ever since then I had it in my mind. Not long ago I wasyoositting here as I am now, when I saw that very general come in who cameyoohere for Easter, and I asked him: ‘Your Excellency,’ said I, ‘can a lady’syoobreath be unpleasant?’ ‘Yes,’ he answered; ‘you ought to open ayoowindow-pane or open the door, for the air is not fresh here.’ And they allyoogo on like that! And what is my breath to them? The dead smell worseyoostill! ‘I won’t spoil the air,’ said I, ‘I’ll order some slippers and goyooaway.’ My darlings, don’t blame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how isyooit I can’t please you? There’s only Ilusha who comes home from school andyooloves me. Yesterday he brought me an apple. Forgive your ownyoomother—forgive a poor lonely creature! Why has my breath become unpleasantyooto you?”yooyooAnd the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed down heryoocheeks. The captain rushed up to her.yooyoo“Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Every one lovesyooyou, every one adores you.” He began kissing both her hands again andyootenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner-napkin, he began wiping awayyooher tears. Alyosha fancied that he too had tears in his eyes. “There, youyoosee, you hear?” he turned with a sort of fury to Alyosha, pointing to theyoopoor imbecile.yooyoo“I see and hear,” muttered Alyosha.yooyoo“Father, father, how can you—with him! Let him alone!” cried the boy,yoositting up in his bed and gazing at his father with glowing eyes.yooyoo“Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never lead toyooanything!” shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with passion.yooyoo“Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I’ll make haste toyoosatisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and I’ll put onyoomine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you in earnest, but notyoowithin these walls. This girl sitting here is my daughter Nina; I forgotyooto introduce her to you. She is a heavenly angel incarnate ... who hasyooflown down to us mortals,... if you can understand.”yooyoo“There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!” Varvarayoowent on indignantly.yooyoo“And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool just now, sheyoois a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good reason to call me so.yooCome along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make an end.”yooyooAnd, snatching Alyosha’s hand, he drew him out of the room into theyoostreet.yooyooyooyooChapter VII. And In The Open Airyooyooyoo“The air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense of theyooword. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your kind interest.”yooyoo“I too have something important to say to you,” observed Alyosha, “only Iyoodon’t know how to begin.”yooyoo“To be sure you must have business with me. You would never have looked inyooupon me without some object. Unless you come simply to complain of theyooboy, and that’s hardly likely. And, by the way, about the boy: I could notyooexplain to you in there, but here I will describe that scene to you. Myyootow was thicker a week ago—I mean my beard. That’s the nickname they giveyooto my beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your brother DmitriyooFyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard, I’d done nothing, he was in ayootowering rage and happened to come upon me. He dragged me out of theyootavern into the market-place; at that moment the boys were coming out ofyooschool, and with them Ilusha. As soon as he saw me in such a state heyoorushed up to me. ‘Father,’ he cried, ‘father!’ He caught hold of me,yoohugged me, tried to pull me away, crying to my assailant, ‘Let go, let go,yooit’s my father, forgive him!’—yes, he actually cried ‘forgive him.’ Heyooclutched at that hand, that very hand, in his little hands and kissedyooit.... I remember his little face at that moment, I haven’t forgotten ityooand I never shall!”yooyoo“I swear,” cried Alyosha, “that my brother will express his most deep andyoosincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in that sameyoomarket-place.... I’ll make him or he is no brother of mine!”yooyoo“Aha, then it’s only a suggestion! And it does not come from him butyoosimply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You should have saidyooso. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your brother’s highlyyoochivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give expression to it at theyootime. He left off dragging me by my beard and released me: ‘You are anyooofficer,’ he said, ‘and I am an officer, if you can find a decent man toyoobe your second send me your challenge. I will give satisfaction, thoughyooyou are a scoundrel.’ That’s what he said. A chivalrous spirit indeed! Iyooretired with Ilusha, and that scene is a family record imprinted for everyooon Ilusha’s soul. No, it’s not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen.yooJudge for yourself. You’ve just been in our mansion, what did you seeyoothere? Three ladies, one a cripple and weak-minded, another a cripple andyoohunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever. She is a student,yoodying to get back to Petersburg, to work for the emancipation of theyooRussian woman on the banks of the Neva. I won’t speak of Ilusha, he isyooonly nine. I am alone in the world, and if I die, what will become of allyooof them? I simply ask you that. And if I challenge him and he kills me onyoothe spot, what then? What will become of them? And worse still, if heyoodoesn’t kill me but only cripples me: I couldn’t work, but I should stillyoobe a mouth to feed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must Iyootake Ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets? That’s what ityoomeans for me to challenge him to a duel. It’s silly talk and nothingyooelse.”yooyoo“He will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet in the middleyooof the market-place,” cried Alyosha again, with glowing eyes.yooyoo“I did think of prosecuting him,” the captain went on, “but look in ouryoocode, could I get much compensation for a personal injury? And thenyooAgrafena Alexandrovna(3) sent for me and shouted at me: ‘Don’t dare toyoodream of it! If you proceed against him, I’ll publish it to all the worldyoothat he beat you for your dishonesty, and then you will be prosecuted.’ Iyoocall God to witness whose was the dishonesty and by whose commands Iyooacted, wasn’t it by her own and Fyodor Pavlovitch’s? ‘And what’s more,’yooshe went on, ‘I’ll dismiss you for good and you’ll never earn anotheryoopenny from me. I’ll speak to my merchant too’ (that’s what she calls heryooold man) ‘and he will dismiss you!’ And if he dismisses me, what can Iyooearn then from any one? Those two are all I have to look to, for youryooFyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over employing me, for anotheryooreason, but he means to make use of papers I’ve signed to go to lawyooagainst me. And so I kept quiet, and you have seen our retreat. But nowyoolet me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger much? I didn’t like to go intoyooit in our mansion before him.”yooyoo“Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was avenging you on me asyooa Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen how he was throwingyoostones at his school-fellows! It’s very dangerous. They might kill him.yooThey are children and stupid. A stone may be thrown and break somebody’syoohead.”yooyoo“That’s just what has happened. He has been bruised by a stone to-day. Notyooon the head but on the chest, just above the heart. He came home cryingyooand groaning and now he is ill.”yooyoo“And you know he attacks them first. He is bitter against them on youryooaccount. They say he stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with a pen-knife notyoolong ago.”yooyoo“I’ve heard about that too, it’s dangerous. Krassotkin is an officialyoohere, we may hear more about it.”yooyoo“I would advise you,” Alyosha went on warmly, “not to send him to schoolyooat all for a time till he is calmer ... and his anger is passed.”yooyoo“Anger!” the captain repeated, “that’s just what it is. He is a littleyoocreature, but it’s a mighty anger. You don’t know all, sir. Let me tellyooyou more. Since that incident all the boys have been teasing him about theyoo‘wisp of tow.’ Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually they areyooangels, but together, especially in schools, they are often merciless.yooTheir teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in Ilusha. An ordinary boy,yooa weak son, would have submitted, have felt ashamed of his father, sir,yoobut he stood up for his father against them all. For his father and foryootruth and justice. For what he suffered when he kissed your brother’s handyooand cried to him ‘Forgive father, forgive him,’—that only God knows—and I,yoohis father. For our children—not your children, but ours—the children ofyoothe poor gentlemen looked down upon by every one—know what justice means,yoosir, even at nine years old. How should the rich know? They don’t exploreyoosuch depths once in their lives. But at that moment in the square when heyookissed his hand, at that moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justiceyoomeans. That truth entered into him and crushed him for ever, sir,” theyoocaptain said hotly again with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his rightyoofist against his left palm as though he wanted to show how “the truth”yoocrushed Ilusha. “That very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and wasyoodelirious all night. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but Iyoonoticed he kept watching me from the corner, though he turned to theyoowindow and pretended to be learning his lessons. But I could see his mindyoowas not on his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget my troubles, sinfulyooman as I am, and I don’t remember much. Mamma began crying, too—I am veryyoofond of mamma—well, I spent my last penny drowning my troubles. Don’tyoodespise me for that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The bestyoomen amongst us are the greatest drunkards. I lay down and I don’t rememberyooabout Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering at him atyooschool. ‘Wisp of tow,’ they shouted, ‘your father was pulled out of theyootavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged forgiveness.’ ”yooyoo“On the third day when he came back from school, I saw he looked pale andyoowretched. ‘What is it?’ I asked. He wouldn’t answer. Well, there’s noyootalking in our mansion without mamma and the girls taking part in it.yooWhat’s more, the girls had heard about it the very first day. Varvara hadyoobegun snarling. ‘You fools and buffoons, can you ever do anythingyoorational?’ ‘Quite so,’ I said, ‘can we ever do anything rational?’ For theyootime I turned it off like that. So in the evening I took the boy out for ayoowalk, for you must know we go for a walk every evening, always the sameyooway, along which we are going now—from our gate to that great stone whichyoolies alone in the road under the hurdle, which marks the beginning of theyootown pasture. A beautiful and lonely spot, sir. Ilusha and I walked alongyoohand in hand as usual. He has a little hand, his fingers are thin andyoocold—he suffers with his chest, you know. ‘Father,’ said he, ‘father!’yoo‘Well?’ said I. I saw his eyes flashing. ‘Father, how he treated youyoothen!’ ‘It can’t be helped, Ilusha,’ I said. ‘Don’t forgive him, father,yoodon’t forgive him! At school they say that he has paid you ten roubles foryooit.’ ‘No, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘I would not take money from him for anything.’yooThen he began trembling all over, took my hand in both his and kissed ityooagain. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘father, challenge him to a duel, at school theyyoosay you are a coward and won’t challenge him, and that you’ll accept tenyooroubles from him.’ ‘I can’t challenge him to a duel, Ilusha,’ I answered.yooAnd I told briefly what I’ve just told you. He listened. ‘Father,’ heyoosaid, ‘anyway don’t forgive it. When I grow up I’ll call him out myselfyooand kill him.’ His eyes shone and glowed. And of course I am his father,yooand I had to put in a word: ‘It’s a sin to kill,’ I said, ‘even in ayooduel.’ ‘Father,’ he said, ‘when I grow up, I’ll knock him down, knock theyoosword out of his hand, I’ll fall on him, wave my sword over him and say:yoo“I could kill you, but I forgive you, so there!” ’ You see what theyooworkings of his little mind have been during these two days; he must haveyoobeen planning that vengeance all day, and raving about it at night.yooyoo“But he began to come home from school badly beaten, I found out about ityoothe day before yesterday, and you are right, I won’t send him to thatyooschool any more. I heard that he was standing up against all the classyooalone and defying them all, that his heart was full of resentment, ofyoobitterness—I was alarmed about him. We went for another walk. ‘Father,’ heyooasked, ‘are the rich people stronger than any one else on earth?’ ‘Yes,yooIlusha,’ I said, ‘there are no people on earth stronger than the rich.’yoo‘Father,’ he said, ‘I will get rich, I will become an officer and conqueryooeverybody. The Tsar will reward me, I will come back here and then no oneyoowill dare—’ Then he was silent and his lips still kept trembling.yoo‘Father,’ he said, ‘what a horrid town this is.’ ‘Yes, Ilusha,’ I said,yoo‘it isn’t a very nice town.’ ‘Father, let us move into another town, ayoonice one,’ he said, ‘where people don’t know about us.’ ‘We will move, weyoowill, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘only I must save up for it.’ I was glad to be ableyooto turn his mind from painful thoughts, and we began to dream of how weyoowould move to another town, how we would buy a horse and cart. ‘We willyooput mamma and your sisters inside, we will cover them up and we’ll walk,yooyou shall have a lift now and then, and I’ll walk beside, for we must takeyoocare of our horse, we can’t all ride. That’s how we’ll go.’ He wasyooenchanted at that, most of all at the thought of having a horse andyoodriving him. For of course a Russian boy is born among horses. Weyoochattered a long while. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted his mind andyoocomforted him.yooyoo“That was the day before yesterday, in the evening, but last nightyooeverything was changed. He had gone to school in the morning, he came backyoodepressed, terribly depressed. In the evening I took him by the hand andyoowe went for a walk; he would not talk. There was a wind blowing and noyoosun, and a feeling of autumn; twilight was coming on. We walked along,yooboth of us depressed. ‘Well, my boy,’ said I, ‘how about our setting offyooon our travels?’ I thought I might bring him back to our talk of the dayyoobefore. He didn’t answer, but I felt his fingers trembling in my hand. Ah,yooI thought, it’s a bad job; there’s something fresh. We had reached theyoostone where we are now. I sat down on the stone. And in the air there wereyoolots of kites flapping and whirling. There were as many as thirty inyoosight. Of course, it’s just the season for the kites. ‘Look, Ilusha,’ saidyooI, ‘it’s time we got out our last year’s kite again. I’ll mend it, whereyoohave you put it away?’ My boy made no answer. He looked away and turnedyoosideways to me. And then a gust of wind blew up the sand. He suddenly fellyooon me, threw both his little arms round my neck and held me tight. Youyooknow, when children are silent and proud, and try to keep back their tearsyoowhen they are in great trouble and suddenly break down, their tears fallyooin streams. With those warm streams of tears, he suddenly wetted my face.yooHe sobbed and shook as though he were in convulsions, and squeezed upyooagainst me as I sat on the stone. ‘Father,’ he kept crying, ‘dear father,yoohow he insulted you!’ And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other’syooarms. ‘Ilusha,’ I said to him, ‘Ilusha darling.’ No one saw us then. Godyooalone saw us, I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank youryoobrother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won’t thrash my boy for youryoosatisfaction.”yooyooHe had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyoshayoofelt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one elseyooin his, Alyosha’s place, the man would not have spoken so openly and wouldyoonot have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heartyoowas trembling on the verge of tears.yooyoo“Ah, how I would like to make friends with your boy!” he cried. “If youyoocould arrange it—”yooyoo“Certainly, sir,” muttered the captain.yooyoo“But now listen to something quite different!” Alyosha went on. “I have ayoomessage for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted hisyoobetrothed, too, a noble-hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. Iyoohave a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, foryoohearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunateyooposition, she commissioned me at once—just now—to bring you this help fromyooher—but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her. Noryoofrom me, his brother, nor from any one else, but from her, only from her!yooShe entreats you to accept her help.... You have both been insulted by theyoosame man. She thought of you only when she had just received a similaryooinsult from him—similar in its cruelty, I mean. She comes like a sister toyoohelp a brother in misfortune.... She told me to persuade you to take theseyootwo hundred roubles from her, as from a sister, knowing that you are inyoosuch need. No one will know of it, it can give rise to no unjust slander.yooThere are the two hundred roubles, and I swear you must take themyoounless—unless all men are to be enemies on earth! But there are brothersyooeven on earth.... You have a generous heart ... you must see that, youyoomust,” and Alyosha held out two new rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes.yooyooThey were both standing at the time by the great stone close to the fence,yooand there was no one near. The notes seemed to produce a tremendousyooimpression on the captain. He started, but at first only fromyooastonishment. Such an outcome of their conversation was the last thing heyooexpected. Nothing could have been farther from his dreams than help fromyooany one—and such a sum!yooyooHe took the notes, and for a minute he was almost unable to answer, quiteyooa new expression came into his face.yooyoo“That for me? So much money—two hundred roubles! Good heavens! Why, Iyoohaven’t seen so much money for the last four years! Mercy on us! And sheyoosays she is a sister.... And is that the truth?”yooyoo“I swear that all I told you is the truth,” cried Alyosha.yooyooThe captain flushed red.yooyoo“Listen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shan’t be behaving like ayooscoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I shan’t be a scoundrel? No,yooAlexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen,” he hurried, touching Alyosha withyooboth his hands. “You are persuading me to take it, saying that it’s ayoosister sends it, but inwardly, in your heart won’t you feel contempt foryoome if I take it, eh?”yooyoo“No, no, on my salvation I swear I shan’t! And no one will ever know butyoome—I, you and she, and one other lady, her great friend.”yooyoo“Never mind the lady! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment like thisyooyou must listen, for you can’t understand what these two hundred roublesyoomean to me now.” The poor fellow went on rising gradually into a sort ofyooincoherent, almost wild enthusiasm. He was thrown off his balance andyootalked extremely fast, as though afraid he would not be allowed to say allyoohe had to say.yooyoo“Besides its being honestly acquired from a ‘sister,’ so highly respectedyooand revered, do you know that now I can look after mamma and Nina, myyoohunchback angel daughter? Doctor Herzenstube came to me in the kindness ofyoohis heart and was examining them both for a whole hour. ‘I can makeyoonothing of it,’ said he, but he prescribed a mineral water which is keptyooat a chemist’s here. He said it would be sure to do her good, and heyooordered baths, too, with some medicine in them. The mineral water costsyoothirty copecks, and she’d need to drink forty bottles perhaps; so I tookyoothe prescription and laid it on the shelf under the ikons, and there ityoolies. And he ordered hot baths for Nina with something dissolved in them,yoomorning and evening. But how can we carry out such a cure in our mansion,yoowithout servants, without help, without a bath, and without water? Nina isyoorheumatic all over, I don’t think I told you that. All her right sideyooaches at night, she is in agony, and, would you believe it, the angelyoobears it without groaning for fear of waking us. We eat what we can get,yooand she’ll only take the leavings, what you’d scarcely give to a dog. ‘Iyooam not worth it, I am taking it from you, I am a burden on you,’ that’syoowhat her angel eyes try to express. We wait on her, but she doesn’t likeyooit. ‘I am a useless cripple, no good to any one.’ As though she were notyooworth it, when she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness.yooWithout her, without her gentle word it would be hell among us! Sheyoosoftens even Varvara. And don’t judge Varvara harshly either, she is anyooangel too, she, too, has suffered wrong. She came to us for the summer,yooand she brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up, toyoogo back with to Petersburg in September, that is now. But we took heryoomoney and lived on it, so now she has nothing to go back with. Thoughyooindeed she couldn’t go back, for she has to work for us like a slave. Sheyoois like an overdriven horse with all of us on her back. She waits on usyooall, mends and washes, sweeps the floor, puts mamma to bed. And mamma isyoocapricious and tearful and insane! And now I can get a servant with thisyoomoney, you understand, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I can get medicines for theyoodear creatures, I can send my student to Petersburg, I can buy beef, I canyoofeed them properly. Good Lord, but it’s a dream!”yooyooAlyosha was delighted that he had brought him such happiness and that theyoopoor fellow had consented to be made happy.yooyoo“Stay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay,” the captain began to talk with frenziedyoorapidity, carried away by a new day-dream. “Do you know that Ilusha and Iyoowill perhaps really carry out our dream. We will buy a horse and cart, ayooblack horse, he insists on its being black, and we will set off as weyoopretended the other day. I have an old friend, a lawyer in K. province,yooand I heard through a trustworthy man that if I were to go he’d give me ayooplace as clerk in his office, so, who knows, maybe he would. So I’d justyooput mamma and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha could drive, and I’d walk, I’dyoowalk.... Why, if I only succeed in getting one debt paid that’s owing me,yooI should have perhaps enough for that too!”yooyoo“There would be enough!” cried Alyosha. “Katerina Ivanovna will send youyooas much more as you need, and you know, I have money too, take what youyoowant, as you would from a brother, from a friend, you can give it backyoolater.... (You’ll get rich, you’ll get rich!) And you know you couldn’tyoohave a better idea than to move to another province! It would be theyoosaving of you, especially of your boy—and you ought to go quickly, beforeyoothe winter, before the cold. You must write to us when you are there, andyoowe will always be brothers.... No, it’s not a dream!”yooyooAlyosha could have hugged him, he was so pleased. But glancing at him heyoostopped short. The man was standing with his neck outstretched and hisyoolips protruding, with a pale and frenzied face. His lips were moving asyoothough trying to articulate something; no sound came, but still his lipsyoomoved. It was uncanny.yooyoo“What is it?” asked Alyosha, startled.yooyoo“Alexey Fyodorovitch ... I ... you,” muttered the captain, faltering,yoolooking at him with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air of desperateyooresolution. At the same time there was a sort of grin on his lips. “I ...yooyou, sir ... wouldn’t you like me to show you a little trick I know?” heyoomurmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid whisper, his voice no longeryoofaltering.yooyoo“What trick?”yooyoo“A pretty trick,” whispered the captain. His mouth was twisted on the leftyooside, his left eye was screwed up. He still stared at Alyosha.yooyoo“What is the matter? What trick?” Alyosha cried, now thoroughly alarmed.yooyoo“Why, look,” squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him the two notesyoowhich he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefingeryooduring the conversation, he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed themyootight in his right hand. “Do you see, do you see?” he shrieked, pale andyooinfuriated. And suddenly flinging up his hand, he threw the crumpled notesyooon the sand. “Do you see?” he shrieked again, pointing to them. “Lookyoothere!”yooyooAnd with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel, gasping andyooexclaiming as he did so:yooyoo“So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your money!yooSo much for your money!”yooyooSuddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha, and his wholeyoofigure expressed unutterable pride.yooyoo“Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honor,” heyoocried, raising his arm in the air. Then he turned quickly and began toyoorun; but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round andyookissed his hand to Alyosha. He ran another five paces and then turnedyooround for the last time. This time his face was not contorted withyoolaughter, but quivering all over with tears. In a tearful, faltering,yoosobbing voice he cried:yooyoo“What should I say to my boy if I took money from you for our shame?”yooyooAnd then he ran on without turning. Alyosha looked after him,yooinexpressibly grieved. Oh, he saw that till the very last moment the manyoohad not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes. He did notyooturn back. Alyosha knew he would not. He would not follow him and call himyooback, he knew why. When he was out of sight, Alyosha picked up the twoyoonotes. They were very much crushed and crumpled, and had been pressed intoyoothe sand, but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyoshayoounfolded them and smoothed them out. After smoothing them out, he foldedyoothem up, put them in his pocket and went to Katerina Ivanovna to report onyoothe success of her commission.yooyooyooyooyooBook V. Pro And ContrayooyooyooyooChapter I. The EngagementyooyooyooMadame Hohlakov was again the first to meet Alyosha. She was flustered;yoosomething important had happened. Katerina Ivanovna’s hysterics had endedyooin a fainting fit, and then “a terrible, awful weakness had followed, sheyoolay with her eyes turned up and was delirious. Now she was in a fever.yooThey had sent for Herzenstube; they had sent for the aunts. The aunts wereyooalready here, but Herzenstube had not yet come. They were all sitting inyooher room, waiting. She was unconscious now, and what if it turned to brainyoofever!”yooyooMadame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. “This is serious, serious,” sheyooadded at every word, as though nothing that had happened to her before hadyoobeen serious. Alyosha listened with distress, and was beginning toyoodescribe his adventures, but she interrupted him at the first words. Sheyoohad not time to listen. She begged him to sit with Lise and wait for heryoothere.yooyoo“Lise,” she whispered almost in his ear, “Lise has greatly surprised meyoojust now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me, too, and so my heartyooforgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon as you had gone, she began toyoobe truly remorseful for having laughed at you to-day and yesterday, thoughyooshe was not laughing at you, but only joking. But she was seriously sorryyoofor it, almost ready to cry, so that I was quite surprised. She has neveryoobeen really sorry for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it. Andyooyou know she is laughing at me every minute. But this time she was inyooearnest. She thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, andyoodon’t take offense or be wounded by her if you can help it. I am neveryoohard upon her, for she’s such a clever little thing. Would you believe it?yooShe said just now that you were a friend of her childhood, ‘the greatestyoofriend of her childhood’—just think of that—‘greatest friend’—and whatyooabout me? She has very strong feelings and memories, and, what’s more, sheyoouses these phrases, most unexpected words, which come out all of a suddenyoowhen you least expect them. She spoke lately about a pine-tree, foryooinstance: there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her earlyyoochildhood. Very likely it’s standing there still; so there’s no need toyoospeak in the past tense. Pine-trees are not like people, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch, they don’t change quickly. ‘Mamma,’ she said, ‘I rememberyoothis pine-tree as in a dream,’ only she said something so original aboutyooit that I can’t repeat it. Besides, I’ve forgotten it. Well, good-by! I amyooso worried I feel I shall go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I’veyoobeen out of my mind twice in my life. Go to Lise, cheer her up, as youyooalways can so charmingly. Lise,” she cried, going to her door, “here I’veyoobrought you Alexey Fyodorovitch, whom you insulted so. He is not at allyooangry, I assure you; on the contrary, he is surprised that you couldyoosuppose so.”yooyoo“_Merci, maman._ Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch.”yooyooAlyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushedyoocrimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as people always doyooin such cases, she began immediately talking of other things, as thoughyoothey were of absorbing interest to her at the moment.yooyoo“Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she toldyoome all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you know,yooalthough mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one thing toyooanother ... I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him the money and howyoois that poor man getting on?”yooyoo“The fact is I didn’t give it to him, and it’s a long story,” answeredyooAlyosha, as though he, too, could think of nothing but his regret atyoohaving failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he, too, looked away, andyoothat he, too, was trying to talk of other things.yooyooAlyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but at theyoofirst words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise’syooattention as well. He spoke with deep feeling, under the influence of theyoostrong impression he had just received, and he succeeded in telling hisyoostory well and circumstantially. In old days in Moscow he had been fond ofyoocoming to Lise and describing to her what had just happened to him, whatyoohe had read, or what he remembered of his childhood. Sometimes they hadyoomade day-dreams and woven whole romances together—generally cheerful andyooamusing ones. Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old days inyooMoscow, two years before. Lise was extremely touched by his story. Alyoshayoodescribed Ilusha with warm feeling. When he finished describing how theyooluckless man trampled on the money, Lise could not help clasping her handsyooand crying out:yooyoo“So you didn’t give him the money! So you let him run away! Oh, dear, youyooought to have run after him!”yooyoo“No, Lise; it’s better I didn’t run after him,” said Alyosha, getting upyoofrom his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room.yooyoo“How so? How is it better? Now they are without food and their case isyoohopeless?”yooyoo“Not hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to them. He’llyootake the money to-morrow. To-morrow he will be sure to take it,” saidyooAlyosha, pacing up and down, pondering. “You see, Lise,” he went on,yoostopping suddenly before her, “I made one blunder, but that, even that, isyooall for the best.”yooyoo“What blunder, and why is it for the best?”yooyoo“I’ll tell you. He is a man of weak and timorous character; he hasyoosuffered so much and is very good-natured. I keep wondering why he tookyoooffense so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last minute, he did notyooknow that he was going to trample on the notes. And I think now that thereyoowas a great deal to offend him ... and it could not have been otherwise inyoohis position.... To begin with, he was sore at having been so glad of theyoomoney in my presence and not having concealed it from me. If he had beenyoopleased, but not so much; if he had not shown it; if he had begunyooaffecting scruples and difficulties, as other people do when they takeyoomoney, he might still endure to take it. But he was too genuinelyyoodelighted, and that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he is a good and truthfulyooman—that’s the worst of the whole business. All the while he talked, hisyoovoice was so weak, so broken, he talked so fast, so fast, he kept laughingyoosuch a laugh, or perhaps he was crying—yes, I am sure he was crying, heyoowas so delighted—and he talked about his daughters—and about the situationyoohe could get in another town.... And when he had poured out his heart, heyoofelt ashamed at having shown me his inmost soul like that. So he began toyoohate me at once. He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. Whatyoohad made him feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon andyooaccepted me as a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and triedyooto intimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had begun embracingyoome; he kept touching me with his hands. This must have been how he came toyoofeel it all so humiliating, and then I made that blunder, a very importantyooone. I suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough to move toyooanother town, we would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself would giveyoohim as much as he wanted out of my own money. That struck him all at once.yooWhy, he thought, did I put myself forward to help him? You know, Lise,yooit’s awfully hard for a man who has been injured, when other people lookyooat him as though they were his benefactors.... I’ve heard that; FatheryooZossima told me so. I don’t know how to put it, but I have often seen ityoomyself. And I feel like that myself, too. And the worst of it was thatyoothough he did not know, up to the very last minute, that he would trampleyooon the notes, he had a kind of presentiment of it, I am sure of that.yooThat’s just what made him so ecstatic, that he had that presentiment....yooAnd though it’s so dreadful, it’s all for the best. In fact, I believeyoonothing better could have happened.”yooyoo“Why, why could nothing better have happened?” cried Lise, looking withyoogreat surprise at Alyosha.yooyoo“Because if he had taken the money, in an hour after getting home, heyoowould be crying with mortification, that’s just what would have happened.yooAnd most likely he would have come to me early to-morrow, and perhaps haveyooflung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did just now. But nowyoohe has gone home awfully proud and triumphant, though he knows he hasyoo‘ruined himself.’ So now nothing could be easier than to make him acceptyoothe two hundred roubles by to-morrow, for he has already vindicated hisyoohonor, tossed away the money, and trampled it under foot.... He couldn’tyooknow when he did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow, and yetyoohe is in terrible need of that money. Though he is proud of himself now,yooyet even to-day he’ll be thinking what a help he has lost. He will thinkyooof it more than ever at night, will dream of it, and by to-morrow morningyoohe may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness. It’s just then that I’llyooappear. ‘Here, you are a proud man,’ I shall say: ‘you have shown it; butyoonow take the money and forgive us!’ And then he will take it!”yooyooAlyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words, “And thenyoohe will take it!” Lise clapped her hands.yooyoo“Ah, that’s true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha, how do youyooknow all this? So young and yet he knows what’s in the heart.... I shouldyoonever have worked it out.”yooyoo“The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footingyoowith us, in spite of his taking money from us,” Alyosha went on in hisyooexcitement, “and not only on an equal, but even on a higher footing.”yooyoo“ ‘On a higher footing’ is charming, Alexey Fyodorovitch; but go on, goyooon!”yooyoo“You mean there isn’t such an expression as ‘on a higher footing’; butyoothat doesn’t matter because—”yooyoo“Oh, no, of course it doesn’t matter. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear.... Youyooknow, I scarcely respected you till now—that is I respected you but on anyooequal footing; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher footing.yooDon’t be angry, dear, at my joking,” she put in at once, with strongyoofeeling. “I am absurd and small, but you, you! Listen, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch. Isn’t there in all our analysis—I mean your analysis ... no,yoobetter call it ours—aren’t we showing contempt for him, for that pooryooman—in analyzing his soul like this, as it were, from above, eh? Inyoodeciding so certainly that he will take the money?”yooyoo“No, Lise, it’s not contempt,” Alyosha answered, as though he had preparedyoohimself for the question. “I was thinking of that on the way here. How canyooit be contempt when we are all like him, when we are all just the same asyoohe is? For you know we are just the same, no better. If we are better, weyooshould have been just the same in his place.... I don’t know about you,yooLise, but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his soulyoois not sordid; on the contrary, full of fine feeling.... No, Lise, I haveyoono contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once to care foryoomost people exactly as one would for children, and for some of them as oneyoowould for the sick in hospitals.”yooyoo“Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we would for theyoosick!”yooyoo“Let us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in myself. Iyooam sometimes very impatient and at other times I don’t see things. It’syoodifferent with you.”yooyoo“Ah, I don’t believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I am!”yooyoo“I am so glad you say so, Lise.”yooyoo“Alexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are sometimes sortyooof formal.... And yet you are not a bit formal really. Go to the door,yooopen it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,” said Lise, in ayoonervous, hurried whisper.yooyooAlyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening.yooyoo“Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” Lise went on, flushing redder andyooredder. “Give me your hand—that’s right. I have to make a greatyooconfession, I didn’t write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,” andyooshe hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatlyyooashamed of the confession.yooyooSuddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times.yooyoo“Ah, Lise, what a good thing!” cried Alyosha joyfully. “You know, I wasyooperfectly sure you were in earnest.”yooyoo“Sure? Upon my word!” She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of it,yooblushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. “I kiss his hand and heyoosays, ‘What a good thing!’ ”yooyooBut her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome.yooyoo“I should like to please you always, Lise, but I don’t know how to do it,”yoohe muttered, blushing too.yooyoo“Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen me as hisyoowife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in earnest. What ayoothing to say! Why, that’s impertinence—that’s what it is.”yooyoo“Why, was it wrong of me to feel sure?” Alyosha asked, laughing suddenly.yooyoo“Ah, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,” cried Lise,yoolooking tenderly and happily at him.yooyooAlyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he stooped down andyookissed her on her lips.yooyoo“Oh, what are you doing?” cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly abashed.yooyoo“Oh, forgive me if I shouldn’t.... Perhaps I’m awfully stupid.... You saidyooI was cold, so I kissed you.... But I see it was stupid.”yooyooLise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. “And in that dress!” sheyooejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly ceased laughing andyoobecame serious, almost stern.yooyoo“Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that yet, and weyooshall have a long time to wait,” she ended suddenly. “Tell me rather whyyooyou who are so clever, so intellectual, so observant, choose a littleyooidiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha, I am awfully happy, for I don’tyoodeserve you a bit.”yooyoo“You do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few days.yooIf I go into the world, I must marry. I know that. _He_ told me to marry,yootoo. Whom could I marry better than you—and who would have me except you?yooI have been thinking it over. In the first place, you’ve known me from ayoochild and you’ve a great many qualities I haven’t. You are moreyoolight-hearted than I am; above all, you are more innocent than I am. Iyoohave been brought into contact with many, many things already.... Ah, youyoodon’t know, but I, too, am a Karamazov. What does it matter if you doyoolaugh and make jokes, and at me, too? Go on laughing. I am so glad you do.yooYou laugh like a little child, but you think like a martyr.”yooyoo“Like a martyr? How?”yooyoo“Yes, Lise, your question just now: whether we weren’t showing contemptyoofor that poor man by dissecting his soul—that was the question of ayoosufferer.... You see, I don’t know how to express it, but any one whoyoothinks of such questions is capable of suffering. Sitting in your invalidyoochair you must have thought over many things already.”yooyoo“Alyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?” murmured Lise inyooa failing voice, weak with happiness. “Listen, Alyosha. What will you wearyoowhen you come out of the monastery? What sort of suit? Don’t laugh, don’tyoobe angry, it’s very, very important to me.”yooyoo“I haven’t thought about the suit, Lise; but I’ll wear whatever you like.”yooyoo“I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white piquéyoowaistcoat, and a soft gray felt hat.... Tell me, did you believe that Iyoodidn’t care for you when I said I didn’t mean what I wrote?”yooyoo“No, I didn’t believe it.”yooyoo“Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible.”yooyoo“You see, I knew that you—seemed to care for me, but I pretended toyoobelieve that you didn’t care for me to make it—easier for you.”yooyoo“That makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am awfullyyoofond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my fortune. Iyoodecided I would ask you for my letter, and if you brought it out calmlyyooand gave it to me (as might have been expected from you) it would meanyoothat you did not love me at all, that you felt nothing, and were simply ayoostupid boy, good for nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left theyooletter at home and that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so asyoonot to give it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it,yoowasn’t it?”yooyoo“Ah, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it was thisyoomorning, in this pocket. Here it is.”yooyooAlyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a distance.yooyoo“But I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from here.”yooyoo“Why, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!”yooyoo“I told a lie if you like,” Alyosha laughed, too. “I told a lie so as notyooto give you back the letter. It’s very precious to me,” he added suddenly,yoowith strong feeling, and again he flushed. “It always will be, and I won’tyoogive it up to any one!”yooyooLise looked at him joyfully. “Alyosha,” she murmured again, “look at theyoodoor. Isn’t mamma listening?”yooyoo“Very well, Lise, I’ll look; but wouldn’t it be better not to look? Whyyoosuspect your mother of such meanness?”yooyoo“What meanness? As for her spying on her daughter, it’s her right, it’syoonot meanness!” cried Lise, firing up. “You may be sure, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch, that when I am a mother, if I have a daughter like myself Iyooshall certainly spy on her!”yooyoo“Really, Lise? That’s not right.”yooyoo“Oh, my goodness! What has meanness to do with it? If she were listeningyooto some ordinary worldly conversation, it would be meanness, but when heryooown daughter is shut up with a young man.... Listen, Alyosha, do you knowyooI shall spy upon you as soon as we are married, and let me tell you Iyooshall open all your letters and read them, so you may as well beyooprepared.”yooyoo“Yes, of course, if so—” muttered Alyosha, “only it’s not right.”yooyoo“Ah, how contemptuous! Alyosha, dear, we won’t quarrel the very first day.yooI’d better tell you the whole truth. Of course, it’s very wrong to spy onyoopeople, and, of course, I am not right and you are, only I shall spy onyooyou all the same.”yooyoo“Do, then; you won’t find out anything,” laughed Alyosha.yooyoo“And, Alyosha, will you give in to me? We must decide that too.”yooyoo“I shall be delighted to, Lise, and certain to, only not in the mostyooimportant things. Even if you don’t agree with me, I shall do my duty inyoothe most important things.”yooyoo“That’s right; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not onlyyooin the most important matters, but in everything. And I am ready to vow toyoodo so now—in everything, and for all my life!” cried Lise fervently, “andyooI’ll do it gladly, gladly! What’s more, I’ll swear never to spy on you,yoonever once, never to read one of your letters. For you are right and I amyoonot. And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy, I know that I won’t doyooit since you consider it dishonorable. You are my conscience now....yooListen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad lately—bothyooyesterday and to-day? I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble, but Iyoosee you have some special grief besides, some secret one, perhaps?”yooyoo“Yes, Lise, I have a secret one, too,” answered Alyosha mournfully. “I seeyooyou love me, since you guessed that.”yooyoo“What grief? What about? Can you tell me?” asked Lise with timid entreaty.yooyoo“I’ll tell you later, Lise—afterwards,” said Alyosha, confused. “Now youyoowouldn’t understand it perhaps—and perhaps I couldn’t explain it.”yooyoo“I know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.”yooyoo“Yes, my brothers too,” murmured Alyosha, pondering.yooyoo“I don’t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,” said Lise suddenly.yooyooHe noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it.yooyoo“My brothers are destroying themselves,” he went on, “my father, too. Andyoothey are destroying others with them. It’s ‘the primitive force of theyooKaramazovs,’ as Father Païssy said the other day, a crude, unbridled,yooearthly force. Does the spirit of God move above that force? Even that Iyoodon’t know. I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov.... Me a monk, a monk!yooAm I a monk, Lise? You said just now that I was.”yooyoo“Yes, I did.”yooyoo“And perhaps I don’t even believe in God.”yooyoo“You don’t believe? What is the matter?” said Lise quietly and gently. ButyooAlyosha did not answer. There was something too mysterious, too subjectiveyooin these last words of his, perhaps obscure to himself, but yet torturingyoohim.yooyoo“And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, isyoogoing, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I amyoowith him! And then I shall be left alone.... I shall come to you, Lise....yooFor the future we will be together.”yooyoo“Yes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together, allyooour lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you.”yooyooAlyosha kissed her.yooyoo“Come, now go. Christ be with you!” and she made the sign of the crossyooover him. “Make haste back to _him_ while he is alive. I see I’ve kept youyoocruelly. I’ll pray to-day for him and you. Alyosha, we shall be happy!yooShall we be happy, shall we?”yooyoo“I believe we shall, Lise.”yooyooAlyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was goingyooout of the house without saying good-by to her. But no sooner had heyooopened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him. Fromyoothe first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose toyoomeet him.yooyoo“Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish nonsense andyooridiculous. I trust you won’t dream—It’s foolishness, nothing butyoofoolishness!” she said, attacking him at once.yooyoo“Only don’t tell her that,” said Alyosha, “or she will be upset, andyoothat’s bad for her now.”yooyoo“Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand that youyooonly agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state, because youyoodidn’t want to irritate her by contradiction?”yooyoo“Oh, no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said,” Alyosha declaredyoostoutly.yooyoo“To be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the first placeyooI shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take her away, you mayyoobe sure of that.”yooyoo“But why?” asked Alyosha. “It’s all so far off. We may have to waityooanother year and a half.”yooyoo“Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that’s true, of course, and you’ll have time toyooquarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half. But I am soyoounhappy! Though it’s such nonsense, it’s a great blow to me. I feel likeyooFamusov in the last scene of _Sorrow from Wit_. You are Tchatsky and sheyoois Sofya, and, only fancy, I’ve run down to meet you on the stairs, and inyoothe play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase. I heard it all; Iyooalmost dropped. So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and heryoohysterics of late! It means love to the daughter but death to the mother.yooI might as well be in my grave at once. And a more serious matter still,yoowhat is this letter she has written? Show it me at once, at once!”yooyoo“No, there’s no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I must know.”yooyoo“She still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness. Her auntsyooare here; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs.yooHerzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I didn’t know what to do foryoohim. I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him. He was driven home inyoomy carriage. And on the top of it all, you and this letter! It’s trueyoonothing can happen for a year and a half. In the name of all that’s holy,yooin the name of your dying elder, show me that letter, Alexey Fyodorovitch.yooI’m her mother. Hold it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it so.”yooyoo“No, I won’t show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I wouldn’t. I amyoocoming to-morrow, and if you like, we can talk over many things, but nowyoogood-by!”yooyooAnd Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street.yooyooyooyooChapter II. Smerdyakov With A GuitaryooyooyooHe had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good-by to Lise,yoothe thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find hisyoobrother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was gettingyoolate, nearly three o’clock. Alyosha’s whole soul turned to the monastery,yooto his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighedyooeverything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was aboutyooto happen grew stronger in Alyosha’s mind with every hour. What thatyoocatastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, heyoocould perhaps not have said definitely. “Even if my benefactor must dieyoowithout me, anyway I won’t have to reproach myself all my life with theyoothought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by andyoohastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his greatyooprecept.”yooyooHis plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over theyoofence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in theyoosummer-house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would notyooannounce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remainyoohidden in the summer-house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If,yooas before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would beyoovery likely to come to the summer-house. Alyosha did not, however, giveyoomuch thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, evenyooif it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.yooyooEverything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle almostyooin the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer-houseyoounseen. He did not want to be noticed. The woman of the house and Fomayootoo, if he were here, might be loyal to his brother and obey hisyooinstructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha come into the garden, or mightyoowarn Dmitri that he was being sought and inquired for.yooyooThere was no one in the summer-house. Alyosha sat down and began to wait.yooHe looked round the summer-house, which somehow struck him as a great dealyoomore ancient than before. Though the day was just as fine as yesterday, ityooseemed a wretched little place this time. There was a circle on the table,yooleft no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before.yooFoolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind, as they always do inyooa time of tedious waiting. He wondered, for instance, why he had sat downyooprecisely in the same place as before, why not in the other seat. At lastyoohe felt very depressed—depressed by suspense and uncertainty. But he hadyoonot sat there more than a quarter of an hour, when he suddenly heard theyoothrum of a guitar somewhere quite close. People were sitting, or had onlyyoojust sat down, somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away.yooAlyosha suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer-house theyooday before, he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat amongyoothe bushes on the left, by the fence. The people must be sitting on ityoonow. Who were they?yooyooA man’s voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto, accompanyingyoohimself on the guitar:yooyooyoo    With invincible forceyoo    I am bound to my dear.yoo    O Lord, have mercyyoo    On her and on me!yoo    On her and on me!yoo    On her and on me!yooyooyooThe voice ceased. It was a lackey’s tenor and a lackey’s song. Anotheryoovoice, a woman’s, suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully, though withyoomincing affectation:yooyoo“Why haven’t you been to see us for so long, Pavel Fyodorovitch? Why doyooyou always look down upon us?”yooyoo“Not at all,” answered a man’s voice politely, but with emphatic dignity.yooIt was clear that the man had the best of the position, and that the womanyoowas making advances. “I believe the man must be Smerdyakov,” thoughtyooAlyosha, “from his voice. And the lady must be the daughter of the houseyoohere, who has come from Moscow, the one who wears the dress with a tailyooand goes to Marfa for soup.”yooyoo“I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme,” the woman’syoovoice continued. “Why don’t you go on?”yooyooThe man sang again:yooyooyoo    What do I care for royal wealthyoo    If but my dear one be in health?yoo    Lord have mercyyoo    On her and on me!yoo    On her and on me!yoo    On her and on me!yooyooyoo“It was even better last time,” observed the woman’s voice. “You sang ‘Ifyoomy darling be in health’; it sounded more tender. I suppose you’veyooforgotten to-day.”yooyoo“Poetry is rubbish!” said Smerdyakov curtly.yooyoo“Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry.”yooyoo“So far as it’s poetry, it’s essential rubbish. Consider yourself, whoyooever talks in rhyme? And if we were all to talk in rhyme, even though ityoowere decreed by government, we shouldn’t say much, should we? Poetry is noyoogood, Marya Kondratyevna.”yooyoo“How clever you are! How is it you’ve gone so deep into everything?” Theyoowoman’s voice was more and more insinuating.yooyoo“I could have done better than that. I could have known more than that, ifyooit had not been for my destiny from my childhood up. I would have shot ayooman in a duel if he called me names because I am descended from a filthyyoobeggar and have no father. And they used to throw it in my teeth inyooMoscow. It had reached them from here, thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch.yooGrigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth, but Iyoowould have sanctioned their killing me before I was born that I might notyoohave come into the world at all. They used to say in the market, and youryoomamma too, with great lack of delicacy, set off telling me that her hairyoowas like a mat on her head, and that she was short of five foot by a weeyoobit. Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said ‘a little bit,’ likeyooevery one else? She wanted to make it touching, a regular peasant’syoofeeling. Can a Russian peasant be said to feel, in comparison with anyooeducated man? He can’t be said to have feeling at all, in his ignorance.yooFrom my childhood up when I hear ‘a wee bit,’ I am ready to burst withyoorage. I hate all Russia, Marya Kondratyevna.”yooyoo“If you’d been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you wouldn’t haveyootalked like that, but would have drawn your saber to defend all Russia.”yooyoo“I don’t want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what’s more, Iyooshould like to abolish all soldiers.”yooyoo“And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?”yooyoo“There’s no need of defense. In 1812 there was a great invasion of Russiayooby Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the present one, andyooit would have been a good thing if they had conquered us. A clever nationyoowould have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it. We should have hadyooquite different institutions.”yooyoo“Are they so much better in their own country than we are? I wouldn’tyoochange a dandy I know of for three young Englishmen,” observed MaryayooKondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her words with a mostyoolanguishing glance.yooyoo“That’s as one prefers.”yooyoo“But you are just like a foreigner—just like a most gentlemanly foreigner.yooI tell you that, though it makes me bashful.”yooyoo“If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just alike inyootheir vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel wears polishedyooboots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it. The Russianyoopeople want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday,yoothough he is mad, and all his children.”yooyoo“You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch.”yooyoo“But he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be unruly. Heyoois mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket, I would have leftyoohere long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in hisyoobehavior, in his mind, and in his poverty. He doesn’t know how to doyooanything, and yet he is respected by every one. I may be only ayoosoup-maker, but with luck I could open a café restaurant in Petrovka, inyooMoscow, for my cookery is something special, and there’s no one in Moscow,yooexcept the foreigners, whose cookery is anything special. DmitriyooFyodorovitch is a beggar, but if he were to challenge the son of the firstyoocount in the country, he’d fight him. Though in what way is he better thanyooI am? For he is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he hasyoowasted without any need!”yooyoo“It must be lovely, a duel,” Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly.yooyoo“How so?”yooyoo“It must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young officers withyoopistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some lady. Ayooperfect picture! Ah, if only girls were allowed to look on, I’d giveyooanything to see one!”yooyoo“It’s all very well when you are firing at some one, but when he is firingyoostraight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. You’d be glad to runyooaway, Marya Kondratyevna.”yooyoo“You don’t mean you would run away?” But Smerdyakov did not deign toyooreply. After a moment’s silence the guitar tinkled again, and he sangyooagain in the same falsetto:yooyooyoo    Whatever you may say,yoo    I shall go far away.yoo    Life will be bright and gayyoo    In the city far away.yoo    I shall not grieve,yoo    I shall not grieve at all,yoo    I don’t intend to grieve at all.yooyooyooThen something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed. They wereyoosilent. Alyosha got up and walked towards them. He found Smerdyakovyoodressed up and wearing polished boots, his hair pomaded, and perhapsyoocurled. The guitar lay on the garden-seat. His companion was the daughteryooof the house, wearing a light-blue dress with a train two yards long. Sheyoowas young and would not have been bad-looking, but that her face was soyooround and terribly freckled.yooyoo“Will my brother Dmitri soon be back?” asked Alyosha with as muchyoocomposure as he could.yooyooSmerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.yooyoo“How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? It’s not as if I were hisyookeeper,” answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and superciliously.yooyoo“But I simply asked whether you do know?” Alyosha explained.yooyoo“I know nothing of his whereabouts and don’t want to.”yooyoo“But my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on in theyoohouse, and promised to let him know when Agrafena Alexandrovna comes.”yooyooSmerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.yooyoo“And how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an hour ago?”yoohe asked, looking at Alyosha.yooyoo“I came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went straight to theyoosummer-house. I hope you’ll forgive me,” he added, addressing MaryayooKondratyevna. “I was in a hurry to find my brother.”yooyoo“Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!” drawled MaryayooKondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha’s apology. “For Dmitri Fyodorovitchyoooften goes to the summer-house in that way. We don’t know he is here andyoohe is sitting in the summer-house.”yooyoo“I am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is now.yooBelieve me, it’s on business of great importance to him.”yooyoo“He never tells us,” lisped Marya Kondratyevna.yooyoo“Though I used to come here as a friend,” Smerdyakov began again, “DmitriyooFyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even here by his incessantyooquestions about the master. ‘What news?’ he’ll ask. ‘What’s going on inyoothere now? Who’s coming and going?’ and can’t I tell him something more.yooTwice already he’s threatened me with death.”yooyoo“With death?” Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.yooyoo“Do you suppose he’d think much of that, with his temper, which you had ayoochance of observing yourself yesterday? He says if I let AgrafenayooAlexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I’ll be the first toyoosuffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I were not even moreyooafraid of doing so, I ought to let the police know. God only knows what heyoomight not do!”yooyoo“His honor said to him the other day, ‘I’ll pound you in a mortar!’ ”yooadded Marya Kondratyevna.yooyoo“Oh, if it’s pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,” observed Alyosha.yoo“If I could meet him, I might speak to him about that too.”yooyoo“Well, the only thing I can tell you is this,” said Smerdyakov, as thoughyoothinking better of it; “I am here as an old friend and neighbor, and ityoowould be odd if I didn’t come. On the other hand, Ivan Fyodorovitch sentyoome first thing this morning to your brother’s lodging in Lake Street,yoowithout a letter, but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dineyoowith him at the restaurant here, in the market-place. I went, but didn’tyoofind Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o’clock. ‘He’s beenyoohere, but he is quite gone,’ those were the very words of his landlady.yooIt’s as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at thisyoomoment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for IvanyooFyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined aloneyooan hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you most particularly notyooto speak of me and of what I have told you, for he’d kill me for nothingyooat all.”yooyoo“Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day?” repeated Alyoshayooquickly.yooyoo“That’s so.”yooyoo“The Metropolis tavern in the market-place?”yooyoo“The very same.”yooyoo“That’s quite likely,” cried Alyosha, much excited. “Thank you,yooSmerdyakov; that’s important. I’ll go there at once.”yooyoo“Don’t betray me,” Smerdyakov called after him.yooyoo“Oh, no, I’ll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don’t be anxious.”yooyoo“But wait a minute, I’ll open the gate to you,” cried Marya Kondratyevna.yooyoo“No; it’s a short cut, I’ll get over the fence again.”yooyooWhat he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran to theyootavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monasticyoodress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call themyoodown. But just as he reached the tavern, a window was flung open, and hisyoobrother Ivan called down to him from it.yooyoo“Alyosha, can’t you come up here to me? I shall be awfully grateful.”yooyoo“To be sure I can, only I don’t quite know whether in this dress—”yooyoo“But I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I’ll run down to meet you.”yooyooA minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was aloneyoodining.yooyooyooyooChapter III. The Brothers Make FriendsyooyooyooIvan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place shut off byyooa screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the room. It was theyoofirst room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall. Waiters wereyoocontinually darting to and fro in it. The only customer in the room was anyooold retired military man drinking tea in a corner. But there was the usualyoobustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts foryoothe waiters, the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, theyoodrone of the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit thisyootavern and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, heyooreflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was not there.yooyoo“Shall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don’t live on tea alone, Iyoosuppose,” cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got hold of Alyosha.yooHe had finished dinner and was drinking tea.yooyoo“Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,” said Alyosha gayly.yooyoo“And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you used to loveyoocherry jam when you were little?”yooyoo“You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still.”yooyooIvan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.yooyoo“I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were eleven, Iyoowas nearly fifteen. There’s such a difference between fifteen and elevenyoothat brothers are never companions at those ages. I don’t know whether Iyoowas fond of you even. When I went away to Moscow for the first few years Iyoonever thought of you at all. Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, weyooonly met once somewhere, I believe. And now I’ve been here more than threeyoomonths, and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other. To-morrow Iyooam going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could see youyooto say good-by and just then you passed.”yooyoo“Were you very anxious to see me, then?”yooyoo“Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you to know me.yooAnd then to say good-by. I believe it’s always best to get to know peopleyoojust before leaving them. I’ve noticed how you’ve been looking at me theseyoothree months. There has been a continual look of expectation in your eyes,yooand I can’t endure that. That’s how it is I’ve kept away from you. But inyoothe end I have learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, Iyoothought. Though I am laughing, I am serious. You do stand firm, don’t you?yooI like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by, even ifyoothey are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes ceased to annoyyoome, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant eyes. You seem to loveyoome for some reason, Alyosha?”yooyoo“I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you—Ivan is a tomb! I say of you,yooIvan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But I understandyoosomething in you, and I did not understand it till this morning.”yooyoo“What’s that?” laughed Ivan.yooyoo“You won’t be angry?” Alyosha laughed too.yooyoo“Well?”yooyoo“That you are just as young as other young men of three and twenty, thatyooyou are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in fact! Now, have Iyooinsulted you dreadfully?”yooyoo“On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,” cried Ivan, warmly andyoogood-humoredly. “Would you believe it that ever since that scene with her,yooI have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness, and just asyoothough you guessed that, you begin about it. Do you know I’ve been sittingyoohere thinking to myself: that if I didn’t believe in life, if I lost faithyooin the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were convinced inyoofact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-riddenyoochaos, if I were struck by every horror of man’s disillusionment—still Iyooshould want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turnyooaway from it till I had drained it! At thirty, though, I shall be sure toyooleave the cup, even if I’ve not emptied it, and turn away—where I don’tyooknow. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph overyooeverything—every disillusionment, every disgust with life. I’ve askedyoomyself many times whether there is in the world any despair that wouldyooovercome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and I’veyoocome to the conclusion that there isn’t, that is till I am thirty, andyoothen I shall lose it of myself, I fancy. Some driveling consumptiveyoomoralists—and poets especially—often call that thirst for life base. It’syooa feature of the Karamazovs, it’s true, that thirst for life regardless ofyooeverything; you have it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetalyooforce on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longingyoofor life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believeyooin the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as theyyooopen in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one lovesyooyou know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done byyoomen, though I’ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from oldyoohabit one’s heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for you,yooeat it, it will do you good. It’s first-rate soup, they know how to makeyooit here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here.yooAnd yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but it’s a mostyooprecious graveyard, that’s what it is! Precious are the dead that lieyoothere, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, ofyoosuch passionate faith in their work, their truth, their struggle and theiryooscience, that I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones andyooweep over them; though I’m convinced in my heart that it’s long beenyoonothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but simplyyoobecause I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in my emotion.yooI love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky—that’s all it is. It’syoonot a matter of intellect or logic, it’s loving with one’s inside, withyooone’s stomach. One loves the first strength of one’s youth. Do youyoounderstand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?” Ivan laughed suddenly.yooyoo“I understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one’s inside, withyooone’s stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully glad that you haveyoosuch a longing for life,” cried Alyosha. “I think every one should loveyoolife above everything in the world.”yooyoo“Love life more than the meaning of it?”yooyoo“Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be regardlessyooof logic, and it’s only then one will understand the meaning of it. I haveyoothought so a long time. Half your work is done, Ivan, you love life, nowyooyou’ve only to try to do the second half and you are saved.”yooyoo“You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what does youryoosecond half mean?”yooyoo“Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died after all.yooCome, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.”yooyoo“I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such _professions deyoofoi_ from such—novices. You are a steadfast person, Alexey. Is it trueyoothat you mean to leave the monastery?”yooyoo“Yes, my elder sends me out into the world.”yooyoo“We shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet before I amyoothirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. Father doesn’t wantyooto turn aside from his cup till he is seventy, he dreams of hanging on toyooeighty in fact, so he says. He means it only too seriously, though he is ayoobuffoon. He stands on a firm rock, too, he stands on his sensuality—thoughyooafter we are thirty, indeed, there may be nothing else to stand on.... Butyooto hang on to seventy is nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain ‘ayooshadow of nobility’ by deceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to-day?”yooyoo“No, but I saw Smerdyakov,” and Alyosha rapidly, though minutely,yoodescribed his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began listening anxiously andyooquestioned him.yooyoo“But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,” addedyooAlyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered.yooyoo“Are you frowning on Smerdyakov’s account?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“Yes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, butyoonow there’s no need,” said Ivan reluctantly.yooyoo“But are you really going so soon, brother?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“What of Dmitri and father? how will it end?” asked Alyosha anxiously.yooyoo“You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I myyoobrother Dmitri’s keeper?” Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenlyyoosmiled bitterly. “Cain’s answer about his murdered brother, wasn’t it?yooPerhaps that’s what you’re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, Iyoocan’t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I’ve finished what I had to do,yooand I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I’ve beenyootrying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?yooNonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finishedyooit just now, you were witness.”yooyoo“At Katerina Ivanovna’s?”yooyoo“Yes, and I’ve released myself once for all. And after all, what have I toyoodo with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn’t come in. I had my own business to settleyoowith Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved asyoothough there was an understanding between us. I didn’t ask him to do it,yoobut he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It’s allyootoo funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Wouldyooyou believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly orderingyoochampagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It’s been going onyoonearly six months, and all at once I’ve thrown it off. I could never haveyooguessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if Iyoowanted.”yooyoo“You are speaking of your love, Ivan?”yooyoo“Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I worriedyoomyself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over her ... and all atyooonce it’s collapsed! I spoke this morning with inspiration, but I wentyooaway and roared with laughter. Would you believe it? Yes, it’s the literalyootruth.”yooyoo“You seem very merry about it now,” observed Alyosha, looking into hisyooface, which had suddenly grown brighter.yooyoo“But how could I tell that I didn’t care for her a bit! Ha ha! It appearsyooafter all I didn’t. And yet how she attracted me! How attractive she wasyoojust now when I made my speech! And do you know she attracts me awfullyyooeven now, yet how easy it is to leave her. Do you think I am boasting?”yooyoo“No, only perhaps it wasn’t love.”yooyoo“Alyosha,” laughed Ivan, “don’t make reflections about love, it’s unseemlyyoofor you. How you rushed into the discussion this morning! I’ve forgottenyooto kiss you for it.... But how she tormented me! It certainly was sittingyooby a ‘laceration.’ Ah, she knew how I loved her! She loved me and notyooDmitri,” Ivan insisted gayly. “Her feeling for Dmitri was simply ayooself-laceration. All I told her just now was perfectly true, but the worstyooof it is, it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find out that sheyoodoesn’t care for Dmitri, and loves me whom she torments, and perhaps sheyoomay never find it out at all, in spite of her lesson to-day. Well, it’syoobetter so; I can simply go away for good. By the way, how is she now? Whatyoohappened after I departed?”yooyooAlyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he heard,yoounconscious and delirious.yooyoo“Isn’t Madame Hohlakov laying it on?”yooyoo“I think not.”yooyoo“I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don’t matter. Godyoogave woman hysterics as a relief. I won’t go to her at all. Why pushyoomyself forward again?”yooyoo“But you told her that she had never cared for you.”yooyoo“I did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let usyoodrink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!”yooyoo“No, brother, we had better not drink,” said Alyosha suddenly. “Besides Iyoofeel somehow depressed.”yooyoo“Yes, you’ve been depressed a long time, I’ve noticed it.”yooyoo“Have you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?”yooyoo“Morning? I didn’t say I should go in the morning.... But perhaps it mayyoobe the morning. Would you believe it, I dined here to-day only to avoidyoodining with the old man, I loathe him so. I should have left long ago, soyoofar as he is concerned. But why are you so worried about my going away?yooWe’ve plenty of time before I go, an eternity!”yooyoo“If you are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?”yooyoo“But what does it matter to us?” laughed Ivan. “We’ve time enough for ouryootalk, for what brought us here. Why do you look so surprised? Answer: whyyoohave we met here? To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old manyooand Dmitri? of foreign travel? of the fatal position of Russia? Of theyooEmperor Napoleon? Is that it?”yooyoo“No.”yooyoo“Then you know what for. It’s different for other people; but we in ouryoogreen youth have to settle the eternal questions first of all. That’s whatyoowe care about. Young Russia is talking about nothing but the eternalyooquestions now. Just when the old folks are all taken up with practicalyooquestions. Why have you been looking at me in expectation for the lastyoothree months? To ask me, ‘What do you believe, or don’t you believe atyooall?’ That’s what your eyes have been meaning for these three months,yoohaven’t they?”yooyoo“Perhaps so,” smiled Alyosha. “You are not laughing at me, now, Ivan?”yooyoo“Me laughing! I don’t want to wound my little brother who has beenyoowatching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha, look straightyooat me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you are, only not ayoonovice. And what have Russian boys been doing up till now, some of them, Iyoomean? In this stinking tavern, for instance, here, they meet and sit downyooin a corner. They’ve never met in their lives before and, when they go outyooof the tavern, they won’t meet again for forty years. And what do theyyootalk about in that momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions,yooof the existence of God and immortality. And those who do not believe inyooGod talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation of all humanityyooon a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same, they’re the sameyooquestions turned inside out. And masses, masses of the most originalyooRussian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal questions! Isn’t it so?”yooyoo“Yes, for real Russians the questions of God’s existence and ofyooimmortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out, comeyoofirst and foremost, of course, and so they should,” said Alyosha, stillyoowatching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.yooyoo“Well, Alyosha, it’s sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all, butyooanything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time one canyoohardly imagine. But there’s one Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfullyyoofond of.”yooyoo“How nicely you put that in!” Alyosha laughed suddenly.yooyoo“Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of God,yooeh?”yooyoo“Begin where you like. You declared yesterday at father’s that there wasyoono God.” Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.yooyoo“I said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and I saw youryooeyes glow. But now I’ve no objection to discussing with you, and I say soyoovery seriously. I want to be friends with you, Alyosha, for I have noyoofriends and want to try it. Well, only fancy, perhaps I too accept God,”yoolaughed Ivan; “that’s a surprise for you, isn’t it?”yooyoo“Yes, of course, if you are not joking now.”yooyoo“Joking? I was told at the elder’s yesterday that I was joking. You know,yoodear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who declaredyoothat, if there were no God, he would have to be invented. _S’il n’existaityoopas Dieu, il faudrait l’inventer._ And man has actually invented God. Andyoowhat’s strange, what would be marvelous, is not that God should reallyyooexist; the marvel is that such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God,yoocould enter the head of such a savage, vicious beast as man. So holy ityoois, so touching, so wise and so great a credit it does to man. As for me,yooI’ve long resolved not to think whether man created God or God man. And Iyoowon’t go through all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that subject,yooall derived from European hypotheses; for what’s a hypothesis there, is anyooaxiom with the Russian boy, and not only with the boys but with theiryooteachers too, for our Russian professors are often just the same boysyoothemselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses. For what are we aiming atyoonow? I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature,yoothat is what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope,yoothat’s it, isn’t it? And therefore I tell you that I accept God simply.yooBut you must note this: if God exists and if He really did create theyooworld, then, as we all know, He created it according to the geometry ofyooEuclid and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions inyoospace. Yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers,yooand even some of the most distinguished, who doubt whether the wholeyoouniverse, or to speak more widely the whole of being, was only created inyooEuclid’s geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, whichyooaccording to Euclid can never meet on earth, may meet somewhere inyooinfinity. I have come to the conclusion that, since I can’t understandyooeven that, I can’t expect to understand about God. I acknowledge humblyyoothat I have no faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidianyooearthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world?yooAnd I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha,yooespecially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions areyooutterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only threeyoodimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what’s more, I acceptyooHis wisdom, His purpose—which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in theyoounderlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmonyyooin which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word toyooWhich the universe is striving, and Which Itself was ‘with God,’ and WhichyooItself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity. There are all sorts ofyoophrases for it. I seem to be on the right path, don’t I? Yet would youyoobelieve it, in the final result I don’t accept this world of God’s, and,yooalthough I know it exists, I don’t accept it at all. It’s not that I don’tyooaccept God, you must understand, it’s the world created by Him I don’t andyoocannot accept. Let me make it plain. I believe like a child that sufferingyoowill be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity ofyoohuman contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like theyoodespicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidian mindyooof man, that in the world’s finale, at the moment of eternal harmony,yoosomething so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for allyoohearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of allyoothe crimes of humanity, of all the blood they’ve shed; that it will makeyooit not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened withyoomen—but though all that may come to pass, I don’t accept it. I won’tyooaccept it. Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I shall seeyooit and say that they’ve met, but still I won’t accept it. That’s what’s atyoothe root of me, Alyosha; that’s my creed. I am in earnest in what I say. Iyoobegan our talk as stupidly as I could on purpose, but I’ve led up to myyooconfession, for that’s all you want. You didn’t want to hear about God,yoobut only to know what the brother you love lives by. And so I’ve toldyooyou.”yooyooIvan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling.yooyoo“And why did you begin ‘as stupidly as you could’?” asked Alyosha, lookingyoodreamily at him.yooyoo“To begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations onyoosuch subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly. And secondly,yoothe stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The stupider one is,yoothe clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless, while intelligenceyoowriggles and hides itself. Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity isyoohonest and straightforward. I’ve led the conversation to my despair, andyoothe more stupidly I have presented it, the better for me.”yooyoo“You will explain why you don’t accept the world?” said Alyosha.yooyoo“To be sure I will, it’s not a secret, that’s what I’ve been leading upyooto. Dear little brother, I don’t want to corrupt you or to turn you fromyooyour stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.” Ivan smiled suddenlyyooquite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had never seen such a smile onyoohis face before.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. Rebellionyooyooyoo“I must make you one confession,” Ivan began. “I could never understandyoohow one can love one’s neighbors. It’s just one’s neighbors, to my mind,yoothat one can’t love, though one might love those at a distance. I onceyooread somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry, frozenyoobeggar came to him, he took him into his bed, held him in his arms, andyoobegan breathing into his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from someyooawful disease. I am convinced that he did that from ‘self-laceration,’yoofrom the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposedyooby duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to love a man, he must beyoohidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.”yooyoo“Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,” observed Alyosha; “he,yootoo, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practicedyooin love, from loving him. But yet there’s a great deal of love in mankind,yooand almost Christ-like love. I know that myself, Ivan.”yooyoo“Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can’t understand it, and theyooinnumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is, whetheryoothat’s due to men’s bad qualities or whether it’s inherent in theiryoonature. To my thinking, Christ-like love for men is a miracle impossibleyooon earth. He was God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for instance, sufferyoointensely. Another can never know how much I suffer, because he is anotheryooand not I. And what’s more, a man is rarely ready to admit another’syoosuffering (as though it were a distinction). Why won’t he admit it, do youyoothink? Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because Iyooonce trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering;yoodegrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me—hunger, foryooinstance—my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higheryoosuffering—for an idea, for instance—he will very rarely admit that,yooperhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancies a manyooshould have who suffers for an idea. And so he deprives me instantly ofyoohis favor, and not at all from badness of heart. Beggars, especiallyyoogenteel beggars, ought never to show themselves, but to ask for charityyoothrough the newspapers. One can love one’s neighbors in the abstract, oryooeven at a distance, but at close quarters it’s almost impossible. If ityoowere as on the stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wearyoosilken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, thenyooone might like looking at them. But even then we should not love them. Butyooenough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view. I meant toyoospeak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had better confineyooourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces the scope of myyooargument to a tenth of what it would be. Still we’d better keep to theyoochildren, though it does weaken my case. But, in the first place, childrenyoocan be loved even at close quarters, even when they are dirty, even whenyoothey are ugly (I fancy, though, children never are ugly). The secondyooreason why I won’t speak of grown-up people is that, besides beingyoodisgusting and unworthy of love, they have a compensation—they’ve eatenyoothe apple and know good and evil, and they have become ‘like gods.’ Theyyoogo on eating it still. But the children haven’t eaten anything, and are soyoofar innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and youyoowill understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too, sufferyoohorribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers’ sins, they must beyoopunished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that reasoningyoois of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here onyooearth. The innocent must not suffer for another’s sins, and especiallyyoosuch innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fondyooof children, too. And observe, cruel people, the violent, the rapacious,yoothe Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of children. Children while theyyooare quite little—up to seven, for instance—are so remote from grown-upyoopeople; they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species.yooI knew a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his career as ayooburglar, murdered whole families, including several children. But when heyoowas in prison, he had a strange affection for them. He spent all his timeyooat his window, watching the children playing in the prison yard. Heyootrained one little boy to come up to his window and made great friendsyoowith him.... You don’t know why I am telling you all this, Alyosha? Myyoohead aches and I am sad.”yooyoo“You speak with a strange air,” observed Alyosha uneasily, “as though youyoowere not quite yourself.”yooyoo“By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,” Ivan went on, seemingyoonot to hear his brother’s words, “told me about the crimes committed byyooTurks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a generalyoorising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women andyoochildren, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave themyooso till morning, and in the morning they hang them—all sorts of things youyoocan’t imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that’s ayoogreat injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel asyooa man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that’s allyoohe can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if heyoowere able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children,yootoo; cutting the unborn child from the mother’s womb, and tossing babiesyooup in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets beforeyootheir mothers’ eyes. Doing it before the mothers’ eyes was what gave zestyooto the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting.yooImagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invadingyooTurks around her. They’ve planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh toyoomake it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk pointsyooa pistol four inches from the baby’s face. The baby laughs with glee,yooholds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in theyoobaby’s face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn’t it? By the way,yooTurks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.”yooyoo“Brother, what are you driving at?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“I think if the devil doesn’t exist, but man has created him, he hasyoocreated him in his own image and likeness.”yooyoo“Just as he did God, then?” observed Alyosha.yooyoo“ ‘It’s wonderful how you can turn words,’ as Polonius says in _Hamlet_,”yoolaughed Ivan. “You turn my words against me. Well, I am glad. Yours mustyoobe a fine God, if man created Him in his image and likeness. You askedyoojust now what I was driving at. You see, I am fond of collecting certainyoofacts, and, would you believe, I even copy anecdotes of a certain sortyoofrom newspapers and books, and I’ve already got a fine collection. TheyooTurks, of course, have gone into it, but they are foreigners. I haveyoospecimens from home that are even better than the Turks. You know weyooprefer beating—rods and scourges—that’s our national institution. Nailingyooears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But the rodyooand the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken from us.yooAbroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners are more humane, or lawsyoohave been passed, so that they don’t dare to flog men now. But they makeyooup for it in another way just as national as ours. And so national that ityoowould be practically impossible among us, though I believe we are beingyooinoculated with it, since the religious movement began in our aristocracy.yooI have a charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how,yooquite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed—a youngyooman, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was converted to theyooChristian faith at the very scaffold. This Richard was an illegitimateyoochild who was given as a child of six by his parents to some shepherds onyoothe Swiss mountains. They brought him up to work for them. He grew up likeyooa little wild beast among them. The shepherds taught him nothing, andyooscarcely fed or clothed him, but sent him out at seven to herd the flockyooin cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so. Quiteyoothe contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had beenyoogiven to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity ofyoofeeding him. Richard himself describes how in those years, like theyooProdigal Son in the Gospel, he longed to eat of the mash given to theyoopigs, which were fattened for sale. But they wouldn’t even give him that,yooand beat him when he stole from the pigs. And that was how he spent allyoohis childhood and his youth, till he grew up and was strong enough to goyooaway and be a thief. The savage began to earn his living as a day laboreryooin Geneva. He drank what he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished byyookilling and robbing an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned toyoodeath. They are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he wasyooimmediately surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods,yoophilanthropic ladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write inyooprison, and expounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him, worked uponyoohim, drummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly confessed hisyoocrime. He was converted. He wrote to the court himself that he was ayoomonster, but that in the end God had vouchsafed him light and shown grace.yooAll Geneva was in excitement about him—all philanthropic and religiousyooGeneva. All the aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed toyoothe prison, kissed Richard and embraced him; ‘You are our brother, youyoohave found grace.’ And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion, ‘Yes,yooI’ve found grace! All my youth and childhood I was glad of pigs’ food, butyoonow even I have found grace. I am dying in the Lord.’ ‘Yes, Richard, dieyooin the Lord; you have shed blood and must die. Though it’s not your faultyoothat you knew not the Lord, when you coveted the pigs’ food and wereyoobeaten for stealing it (which was very wrong of you, for stealing isyooforbidden); but you’ve shed blood and you must die.’ And on the last day,yooRichard, perfectly limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute:yoo‘This is my happiest day. I am going to the Lord.’ ‘Yes,’ cry the pastorsyooand the judges and philanthropic ladies. ‘This is the happiest day of youryoolife, for you are going to the Lord!’ They all walk or drive to theyooscaffold in procession behind the prison van. At the scaffold they call toyooRichard: ‘Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou hast found grace!’yooAnd so, covered with his brothers’ kisses, Richard is dragged on to theyooscaffold, and led to the guillotine. And they chopped off his head inyoobrotherly fashion, because he had found grace. Yes, that’s characteristic.yooThat pamphlet is translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropistsyooof aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been distributedyoogratis for the enlightenment of the people. The case of Richard isyoointeresting because it’s national. Though to us it’s absurd to cut off ayooman’s head, because he has become our brother and has found grace, yet weyoohave our own speciality, which is all but worse. Our historical pastime isyoothe direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines in Nekrassovyoodescribing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, ‘on its meek eyes,’yooevery one must have seen it. It’s peculiarly Russian. He describes how ayoofeeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move.yooThe peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not knowing whatyoohe is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly overyooand over again. ‘However weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.’yooThe nag strains, and then he begins lashing the poor defenseless creatureyooon its weeping, on its ‘meek eyes.’ The frantic beast tugs and draws theyooload, trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sortyooof unnatural spasmodic action—it’s awful in Nekrassov. But that’s only ayoohorse, and God has given horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taughtyoous, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it. But men, too, canyoobe beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their ownyoochild with a birch-rod, a girl of seven. I have an exact account of it.yooThe papa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs. ‘It stings more,’yoosaid he, and so he began stinging his daughter. I know for a fact thereyooare people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literalyoosensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict. Theyyoobeat for a minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and moreyoosavagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it gasps,yoo‘Daddy! daddy!’ By some diabolical unseemly chance the case was broughtyoointo court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have long called ayoobarrister ‘a conscience for hire.’ The counsel protests in his client’syoodefense. ‘It’s such a simple thing,’ he says, ‘an everyday domestic event.yooA father corrects his child. To our shame be it said, it is brought intoyoocourt.’ The jury, convinced by him, give a favorable verdict. The publicyooroars with delight that the torturer is acquitted. Ah, pity I wasn’tyoothere! I would have proposed to raise a subscription in his honor!yooCharming pictures.yooyoo“But I’ve still better things about children. I’ve collected a great,yoogreat deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl ofyoofive who was hated by her father and mother, ‘most worthy and respectableyoopeople, of good education and breeding.’ You see, I must repeat again, ityoois a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of torturingyoochildren, and children only. To all other types of humanity theseyootorturers behave mildly and benevolently, like cultivated and humaneyooEuropeans; but they are very fond of tormenting children, even fond ofyoochildren themselves in that sense. It’s just their defenselessness thatyootempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has noyoorefuge and no appeal, that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, ofyoocourse, a demon lies hidden—the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heatyooat the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let offyoothe chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidneyyoodisease, and so on.yooyoo“This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by thoseyoocultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for no reasonyootill her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements ofyoocruelty—shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, andyoobecause she didn’t ask to be taken up at night (as though a child of fiveyoosleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask), theyyoosmeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was heryoomother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the pooryoochild’s groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who can’t evenyoounderstand what’s done to her, should beat her little aching heart withyooher tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentfulyootears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that, friend andyoobrother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand why this infamyyoomust be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not haveyooexisted on earth, for he could not have known good and evil. Why should heyooknow that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the wholeyooworld of knowledge is not worth that child’s prayer to ‘dear, kind God’! Iyoosay nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten theyooapple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I amyoomaking you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I’ll leave off if youyoolike.”yooyoo“Never mind. I want to suffer too,” muttered Alyosha.yooyoo“One picture, only one more, because it’s so curious, so characteristic,yooand I have only just read it in some collection of Russian antiquities.yooI’ve forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was in the darkest days ofyooserfdom at the beginning of the century, and long live the Liberator ofyoothe People! There was in those days a general of aristocratic connections,yoothe owner of great estates, one of those men—somewhat exceptional, Iyoobelieve, even then—who, retiring from the service into a life of leisure,yooare convinced that they’ve earned absolute power over the lives of theiryoosubjects. There were such men then. So our general, settled on hisyooproperty of two thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his pooryooneighbors as though they were dependents and buffoons. He has kennels ofyoohundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys—all mounted, and inyoouniform. One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw a stone inyooplay and hurt the paw of the general’s favorite hound. ‘Why is my favoriteyoodog lame?’ He is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog’s paw.yoo‘So you did it.’ The general looked the child up and down. ‘Take him.’ Heyoowas taken—taken from his mother and kept shut up all night. Early thatyoomorning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, hisyoodependents, dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full huntingyooparade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in front ofyoothem all stands the mother of the child. The child is brought from theyoolock-up. It’s a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day, a capital day for hunting.yooThe general orders the child to be undressed; the child is stripped naked.yooHe shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry.... ‘Make him run,’yoocommands the general. ‘Run! run!’ shout the dog-boys. The boy runs.... ‘Atyoohim!’ yells the general, and he sets the whole pack of hounds on theyoochild. The hounds catch him, and tear him to pieces before his mother’syooeyes!... I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable ofyooadministering his estates. Well—what did he deserve? To be shot? To beyooshot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings? Speak, Alyosha!”yooyoo“To be shot,” murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a pale,yootwisted smile.yooyoo“Bravo!” cried Ivan, delighted. “If even you say so.... You’re a prettyyoomonk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart, AlyoshayooKaramazov!”yooyoo“What I said was absurd, but—”yooyoo“That’s just the point, that ‘but’!” cried Ivan. “Let me tell you, novice,yoothat the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world stands onyooabsurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in it withoutyoothem. We know what we know!”yooyoo“What do you know?”yooyoo“I understand nothing,” Ivan went on, as though in delirium. “I don’t wantyooto understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact. I made up my mindyoolong ago not to understand. If I try to understand anything, I shall beyoofalse to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the fact.”yooyoo“Why are you trying me?” Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. “Will youyoosay what you mean at last?”yooyoo“Of course, I will; that’s what I’ve been leading up to. You are dear toyoome, I don’t want to let you go, and I won’t give you up to your Zossima.”yooyooIvan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.yooyoo“Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer. Of theyooother tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its crust toyooits center, I will say nothing. I have narrowed my subject on purpose. Iyooam a bug, and I recognize in all humility that I cannot understand why theyooworld is arranged as it is. Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; theyyoowere given paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven,yoothough they knew they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pityyoothem. With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know isyoothat there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause followsyooeffect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its level—butyoothat’s only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I can’t consent to liveyooby it! What comfort is it to me that there are none guilty and that causeyoofollows effect simply and directly, and that I know it?—I must haveyoojustice, or I will destroy myself. And not justice in some remote infiniteyootime and space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself. I haveyoobelieved in it. I want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me riseyooagain, for if it all happens without me, it will be too unfair. Surely Iyoohaven’t suffered, simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manureyoothe soil of the future harmony for somebody else. I want to see with myyooown eyes the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up andyooembrace his murderer. I want to be there when every one suddenlyyoounderstands what it has all been for. All the religions of the world areyoobuilt on this longing, and I am a believer. But then there are theyoochildren, and what am I to do about them? That’s a question I can’tyooanswer. For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions,yoobut I’ve only taken the children, because in their case what I mean is soyoounanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternalyooharmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please? It’s beyondyooall comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for theyooharmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil for theyooharmony of the future? I understand solidarity in sin among men. Iyoounderstand solidarity in retribution, too; but there can be no suchyoosolidarity with children. And if it is really true that they must shareyooresponsibility for all their fathers’ crimes, such a truth is not of thisyooworld and is beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say, perhaps, thatyoothe child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he didn’t growyooup, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old. Oh, Alyosha, Iyooam not blaspheming! I understand, of course, what an upheaval of theyoouniverse it will be, when everything in heaven and earth blends in oneyoohymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries aloud: ‘Thouyooart just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.’ When the mother embraces theyoofiend who threw her child to the dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears,yoo‘Thou art just, O Lord!’ then, of course, the crown of knowledge will beyooreached and all will be made clear. But what pulls me up here is that Iyoocan’t accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to takeyoomy own measures. You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if Iyoolive to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cryyooaloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the child’s torturer,yoo‘Thou art just, O Lord!’ but I don’t want to cry aloud then. While thereyoois still time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higheryooharmony altogether. It’s not worth the tears of that one tortured childyoowho beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in itsyoostinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to ‘dear, kind God’! It’s notyooworth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for,yooor there can be no harmony. But how? How are you going to atone for them?yooIs it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avengingyoothem? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do,yoosince those children have already been tortured? And what becomes ofyooharmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don’tyoowant more suffering. And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sumyooof sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest thatyoothe truth is not worth such a price. I don’t want the mother to embraceyoothe oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Letyooher forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer foryoothe immeasurable suffering of her mother’s heart. But the sufferings ofyooher tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive theyootorturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, ifyoothey dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the wholeyooworld a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? Iyoodon’t want harmony. From love for humanity I don’t want it. I would ratheryoobe left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with myyoounavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_.yooBesides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it’s beyond our means toyoopay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entranceyooticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon asyoopossible. And that I am doing. It’s not God that I don’t accept, Alyosha,yooonly I most respectfully return Him the ticket.”yooyoo“That’s rebellion,” murmured Alyosha, looking down.yooyoo“Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,” said Ivan earnestly. “One canyoohardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me yourself, Iyoochallenge you—answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of humanyoodestiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peaceyooand rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture toyoodeath only one tiny creature—that baby beating its breast with its fist,yoofor instance—and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would youyooconsent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell theyootruth.”yooyoo“No, I wouldn’t consent,” said Alyosha softly.yooyoo“And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it wouldyooagree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated bloodyooof a little victim? And accepting it would remain happy for ever?”yooyoo“No, I can’t admit it. Brother,” said Alyosha suddenly, with flashingyooeyes, “you said just now, is there a being in the whole world who wouldyoohave the right to forgive and could forgive? But there is a Being and Heyoocan forgive everything, all and for all, because He gave His innocentyooblood for all and everything. You have forgotten Him, and on Him is builtyoothe edifice, and it is to Him they cry aloud, ‘Thou art just, O Lord, foryooThy ways are revealed!’ ”yooyoo“Ah! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten Him; onyoothe contrary I’ve been wondering all the time how it was you did not bringyooHim in before, for usually all arguments on your side put Him in theyooforeground. Do you know, Alyosha—don’t laugh! I made a poem about a yearyooago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I’ll tell it to you.”yooyoo“You wrote a poem?”yooyoo“Oh, no, I didn’t write it,” laughed Ivan, “and I’ve never written twoyoolines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and Iyooremembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my firstyooreader—that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?”yoosmiled Ivan. “Shall I tell it to you?”yooyoo“I am all attention,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“My poem is called ‘The Grand Inquisitor’; it’s a ridiculous thing, but Iyoowant to tell it to you.”yooyooyooyooChapter V. The Grand Inquisitoryooyooyoo“Even this must have a preface—that is, a literary preface,” laughed Ivan,yoo“and I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in theyoosixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, ityoowas customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not toyoospeak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in theyoomonasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, theyoosaints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. Inyoothose days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo’s _Notre Dame deyooParis_ an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people inyoothe Hôtel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor of theyoobirth of the dauphin. It was called _Le bon jugement de la très sainte etyoogracieuse Vierge Marie_, and she appears herself on the stage andyoopronounces her _bon jugement_. Similar plays, chiefly from the OldyooTestament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too, up to the times ofyooPeter the Great. But besides plays there were all sorts of legends andyooballads scattered about the world, in which the saints and angels and allyoothe powers of Heaven took part when required. In our monasteries the monksyoobusied themselves in translating, copying, and even composing suchyoopoems—and even under the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (ofyoocourse, from the Greek), _The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell_, withyoodescriptions as bold as Dante’s. Our Lady visits hell, and the ArchangelyooMichael leads her through the torments. She sees the sinners and theiryoopunishment. There she sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in ayooburning lake; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that theyyoocan’t swim out, and ‘these God forgets’—an expression of extraordinaryyoodepth and force. And so Our Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before theyoothrone of God and begs for mercy for all in hell—for all she has seenyoothere, indiscriminately. Her conversation with God is immenselyyoointeresting. She beseeches Him, she will not desist, and when God pointsyooto the hands and feet of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, ‘How canyooI forgive His tormentors?’ she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, allyoothe angels and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on allyoowithout distinction. It ends by her winning from God a respite ofyoosuffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the sinners atyooonce raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting, ‘Thou art just, OyooLord, in this judgment.’ Well, my poem would have been of that kind if ityoohad appeared at that time. He comes on the scene in my poem, but He saysyoonothing, only appears and passes on. Fifteen centuries have passed sinceyooHe promised to come in His glory, fifteen centuries since His prophetyoowrote, ‘Behold, I come quickly’; ‘Of that day and that hour knoweth noyooman, neither the Son, but the Father,’ as He Himself predicted on earth.yooBut humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love. Oh,yoowith greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased toyoosee signs from heaven.yooyooyoo    No signs from heaven come to-dayyoo    To add to what the heart doth say.yooyooyooThere was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is trueyoothere were many miracles in those days. There were saints who performedyoomiraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies, wereyoovisited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But the devil did not slumber, andyoodoubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles. Andyoojust then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. “Ayoohuge star like to a torch” (that is, to a church) “fell on the sources ofyoothe waters and they became bitter.” These heretics began blasphemouslyyoodenying miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more ardentyooin their faith. The tears of humanity rose up to Him as before, awaitedyooHis coming, loved Him, hoped for Him, yearned to suffer and die for Him asyoobefore. And so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervor, “O Lordyooour God, hasten Thy coming,” so many ages called upon Him, that in Hisyooinfinite mercy He deigned to come down to His servants. Before that day Heyoohad come down, He had visited some holy men, martyrs and hermits, as isyoowritten in their lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute faith in theyootruth of his words, bore witness thatyooyooyoo    Bearing the Cross, in slavish dress,yoo    Weary and worn, the Heavenly Kingyoo    Our mother, Russia, came to bless,yoo    And through our land went wandering.yooyooyooAnd that certainly was so, I assure you.yooyoo“And behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people, to theyootortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him likeyoochildren. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible timeyooof the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to the glory of God,yooand ‘in the splendid _auto da fé_ the wicked heretics were burnt.’ Oh, ofyoocourse, this was not the coming in which He will appear according to Hisyoopromise at the end of time in all His heavenly glory, and which will beyoosudden ‘as lightning flashing from east to west.’ No, He visited Hisyoochildren only for a moment, and there where the flames were cracklingyooround the heretics. In His infinite mercy He came once more among men inyoothat human shape in which He walked among men for three years fifteenyoocenturies ago. He came down to the ‘hot pavements’ of the southern town inyoowhich on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, _ad majorem gloriamyooDei_, been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificentyoo_auto da fé_, in the presence of the king, the court, the knights, theyoocardinals, the most charming ladies of the court, and the whole populationyooof Seville.yooyoo“He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one recognizedyooHim. That might be one of the best passages in the poem. I mean, why theyyoorecognized Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to Him, they surroundyooHim, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves silently in their midstyoowith a gentle smile of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in Hisyooheart, light and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed onyoothe people, stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out Hisyoohands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact withyooHim, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind fromyoochildhood, cries out, ‘O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!’ and, as ityoowere, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The crowdyooweeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers beforeyooHim, sing, and cry hosannah. ‘It is He—it is He!’ all repeat. ‘It must beyooHe, it can be no one but Him!’ He stops at the steps of the Sevilleyoocathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a littleyooopen white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of ayooprominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. ‘He will raiseyooyour child,’ the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming toyoomeet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the deadyoochild throws herself at His feet with a wail. ‘If it is Thou, raise myyoochild!’ she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, theyoocoffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and Hisyoolips once more softly pronounce, ‘Maiden, arise!’ and the maiden arises.yooThe little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling withyoowide-open wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had put inyooher hand.yooyoo“There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment theyoocardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He is anyooold man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunkenyooeyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not dressed in hisyoogorgeous cardinal’s robes, as he was the day before, when he was burningyoothe enemies of the Roman Church—at this moment he is wearing his coarse,yooold, monk’s cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistantsyooand slaves and the ‘holy guard.’ He stops at the sight of the crowd andyoowatches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set theyoocoffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. Heyooknits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. Heyooholds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power,yooso completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedienceyooto him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in theyoomidst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. Theyoocrowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the oldyooInquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guardsyoolead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancientyoopalace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and isyoofollowed by the dark, burning, ‘breathless’ night of Seville. The air isyoo‘fragrant with laurel and lemon.’ In the pitch darkness the iron door ofyoothe prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes inyoowith a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behindyoohim. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face.yooAt last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks.yooyoo“ ‘Is it Thou? Thou?’ but receiving no answer, he adds at once, ‘Don’tyooanswer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thouyoowouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadstyoosaid of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast come toyoohinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost Thou know what will beyooto-morrow? I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thouyooor only a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burnyooThee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very people who haveyooto-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rushyooto heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes, maybe Thouyooknowest it,’ he added with thoughtful penetration, never for a momentyootaking his eyes off the Prisoner.”yooyoo“I don’t quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?” Alyosha, who had beenyoolistening in silence, said with a smile. “Is it simply a wild fantasy, oryooa mistake on the part of the old man—some impossible _quiproquo_?”yooyoo“Take it as the last,” said Ivan, laughing, “if you are so corrupted byyoomodern realism and can’t stand anything fantastic. If you like it to be ayoocase of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,” he went on,yoolaughing, “the old man was ninety, and he might well be crazy over his setyooidea. He might have been struck by the appearance of the Prisoner. Ityoomight, in fact, be simply his ravings, the delusion of an old man ofyooninety, over-excited by the _auto da fé_ of a hundred heretics the dayyoobefore. But does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake ofyooidentity or a wild fantasy? All that matters is that the old man shouldyoospeak out, should speak openly of what he has thought in silence foryooninety years.”yooyoo“And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not say a word?”yooyoo“That’s inevitable in any case,” Ivan laughed again. “The old man has toldyooHim He hasn’t the right to add anything to what He has said of old. Oneyoomay say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman Catholicism, in myyooopinion at least. ‘All has been given by Thee to the Pope,’ they say, ‘andyooall, therefore, is still in the Pope’s hands, and there is no need foryooThee to come now at all. Thou must not meddle for the time, at least.’yooThat’s how they speak and write too—the Jesuits, at any rate. I have readyooit myself in the works of their theologians. ‘Hast Thou the right toyooreveal to us one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hastyoocome?’ my old man asks Him, and answers the question for Him. ‘No, Thouyoohast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said of old, andyoomayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst exalt when Thou wastyooon earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest anew will encroach on men’s freedom ofyoofaith; for it will be manifest as a miracle, and the freedom of theiryoofaith was dearer to Thee than anything in those days fifteen hundred yearsyooago. Didst Thou not often say then, “I will make you free”? But now Thouyoohast seen these “free” men,’ the old man adds suddenly, with a pensiveyoosmile. ‘Yes, we’ve paid dearly for it,’ he goes on, looking sternly atyooHim, ‘but at last we have completed that work in Thy name. For fifteenyoocenturies we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is ended andyooover for good. Dost Thou not believe that it’s over for good? Thou lookestyoomeekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me. But let me tellyooThee that now, to-day, people are more persuaded than ever that they haveyooperfect freedom, yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid ityoohumbly at our feet. But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst?yooWas this Thy freedom?’ ”yooyoo“I don’t understand again,” Alyosha broke in. “Is he ironical, is heyoojesting?”yooyoo“Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his Church thatyooat last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy.yoo‘For now’ (he is speaking of the Inquisition, of course) ‘for the firstyootime it has become possible to think of the happiness of men. Man wasyoocreated a rebel; and how can rebels be happy? Thou wast warned,’ he saysyooto Him. ‘Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didstyoonot listen to those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which menyoomight be made happy. But, fortunately, departing Thou didst hand on theyoowork to us. Thou hast promised, Thou hast established by Thy word, Thouyoohast given to us the right to bind and to unbind, and now, of course, Thouyoocanst not think of taking it away. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinderyoous?’ ”yooyoo“And what’s the meaning of ‘no lack of admonitions and warnings’?” askedyooAlyosha.yooyoo“Why, that’s the chief part of what the old man must say.yooyoo“ ‘The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction andyoonon-existence,’ the old man goes on, ‘the great spirit talked with Thee inyoothe wilderness, and we are told in the books that he “tempted” Thee. Isyoothat so? And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee inyoothree questions and what Thou didst reject, and what in the books isyoocalled “the temptation”? And yet if there has ever been on earth a realyoostupendous miracle, it took place on that day, on the day of the threeyootemptations. The statement of those three questions was itself theyoomiracle. If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argumentyoothat those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly fromyoothe books, and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew, and toyoodo so had gathered together all the wise men of the earth—rulers, chiefyoopriests, learned men, philosophers, poets—and had set them the task toyooinvent three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, butyooexpress in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history ofyoothe world and of humanity—dost Thou believe that all the wisdom of theyooearth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to theyoothree questions which were actually put to Thee then by the wise andyoomighty spirit in the wilderness? From those questions alone, from theyoomiracle of their statement, we can see that we have here to do not withyoothe fleeting human intelligence, but with the absolute and eternal. For inyoothose three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is, as ityoowere, brought together into one whole, and foretold, and in them areyoounited all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature. At theyootime it could not be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now thatyoofifteen hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those threeyooquestions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so trulyyoofulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.yooyoo“ ‘Judge Thyself who was right—Thou or he who questioned Thee then?yooRemember the first question; its meaning, in other words, was this: “Thouyoowouldst go into the world, and art going with empty hands, with someyoopromise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their naturalyoounruliness cannot even understand, which they fear and dread—for nothingyoohas ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society thanyoofreedom. But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barrenyoowilderness? Turn them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like ayooflock of sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lestyooThou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.” But Thou wouldst notyoodeprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking, what is thatyoofreedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread? Thou didst reply thatyooman lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou know that for the sake of thatyooearthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against Thee and willyoostrive with Thee and overcome Thee, and all will follow him, crying, “Whoyoocan compare with this beast? He has given us fire from heaven!” Dost Thouyooknow that the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips ofyootheir sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is onlyyoohunger? “Feed men, and then ask of them virtue!” that’s what they’ll writeyooon the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and with which theyyoowill destroy Thy temple. Where Thy temple stood will rise a new building;yoothe terrible tower of Babel will be built again, and though, like the oneyooof old, it will not be finished, yet Thou mightest have prevented that newyootower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years; foryoothey will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with theiryootower. They will seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, foryoowe shall be again persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry toyoous, “Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven’tyoogiven it!” And then we shall finish building their tower, for he finishesyoothe building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them in Thy name,yoodeclaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never, never can they feedyoothemselves without us! No science will give them bread so long as theyyooremain free. In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet, and sayyooto us, “Make us your slaves, but feed us.” They will understandyoothemselves, at last, that freedom and bread enough for all areyooinconceivable together, for never, never will they be able to shareyoobetween them! They will be convinced, too, that they can never be free,yoofor they are weak, vicious, worthless and rebellious. Thou didst promiseyoothem the bread of Heaven, but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthlyyoobread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man? And ifyoofor the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what isyooto become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creaturesyoowho will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake ofyoothe heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for the tens of thousands of theyoogreat and strong, while the millions, numerous as the sands of the sea,yoowho are weak but love Thee, must exist only for the sake of the great andyoostrong? No, we care for the weak too. They are sinful and rebellious, butyooin the end they too will become obedient. They will marvel at us and lookyooon us as gods, because we are ready to endure the freedom which they haveyoofound so dreadful and to rule over them—so awful it will seem to them toyoobe free. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them inyooThy name. We shall deceive them again, for we will not let Thee come to usyooagain. That deception will be our suffering, for we shall be forced toyoolie.yooyoo“ ‘This is the significance of the first question in the wilderness, andyoothis is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which Thouyoohast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies hid the greatyoosecret of this world. Choosing “bread,” Thou wouldst have satisfied theyoouniversal and everlasting craving of humanity—to find some one to worship.yooSo long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and soyoopainfully as to find some one to worship. But man seeks to worship what isyooestablished beyond dispute, so that all men would agree at once to worshipyooit. For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one oryoothe other can worship, but to find something that all would believe in andyooworship; what is essential is that all may be _together_ in it. Thisyoocraving for _community_ of worship is the chief misery of every manyooindividually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For the sakeyooof common worship they’ve slain each other with the sword. They have setyooup gods and challenged one another, “Put away your gods and come andyooworship ours, or we will kill you and your gods!” And so it will be to theyooend of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fallyoodown before idols just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not butyoohave known, this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst rejectyoothe one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow downyooto Thee alone—the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast rejected it foryoothe sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold what Thou didstyoofurther. And all again in the name of freedom! I tell Thee that man isyootormented by no greater anxiety than to find some one quickly to whom heyoocan hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature isyooborn. But only one who can appease their conscience can take over theiryoofreedom. In bread there was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread,yooand man will worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread. But ifyoosome one else gains possession of his conscience—oh! then he will castyooaway Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience. Inyoothat Thou wast right. For the secret of man’s being is not only to liveyoobut to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of theyooobject of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would ratheryoodestroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance.yooThat is true. But what happened? Instead of taking men’s freedom fromyoothem, Thou didst make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that manyooprefers peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge ofyoogood and evil? Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom ofyooconscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold,yooinstead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man atyoorest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional, vague andyooenigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond the strength of men,yooacting as though Thou didst not love them at all—Thou who didst come toyoogive Thy life for them! Instead of taking possession of men’s freedom,yooThou didst increase it, and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind withyooits sufferings for ever. Thou didst desire man’s free love, that he shouldyoofollow Thee freely, enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of theyoorigid ancient law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himselfyoowhat is good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him as hisyooguide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even Thy imageyooand Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful burden of freeyoochoice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in Thee, foryoothey could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than Thouyoohast caused, laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems.yooyoo“ ‘So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for theyoodestruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it. Yet whatyoowas offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers alone, able toyooconquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotentyoorebels for their happiness—those forces are miracle, mystery andyooauthority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example for doingyooso. When the wise and dread spirit set Thee on the pinnacle of the templeyooand said to Thee, “If Thou wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of Godyoothen cast Thyself down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him upyoolest he fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou artyoothe Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in Thy Father.”yooBut Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down. Oh, of course,yooThou didst proudly and well, like God; but the weak, unruly race of men,yooare they gods? Oh, Thou didst know then that in taking one step, in makingyooone movement to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and haveyoolost all Thy faith in Him, and wouldst have been dashed to pieces againstyoothat earth which Thou didst come to save. And the wise spirit that temptedyooThee would have rejoiced. But I ask again, are there many like Thee? Andyoocouldst Thou believe for one moment that men, too, could face such ayootemptation? Is the nature of men such, that they can reject miracle, andyooat the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, mostyooagonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of theyooheart? Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books, wouldyoobe handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the earth, and Thouyoodidst hope that man, following Thee, would cling to God and not ask for ayoomiracle. But Thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he rejectsyooGod too; for man seeks not so much God as the miraculous. And as manyoocannot bear to be without the miraculous, he will create new miracles ofyoohis own for himself, and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft,yoothough he might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel. Thouyoodidst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee, mocking andyooreviling Thee, “Come down from the cross and we will believe that Thou artyooHe.” Thou didst not come down, for again Thou wouldst not enslave man by ayoomiracle, and didst crave faith given freely, not based on miracle. Thouyoodidst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave beforeyoothe might that has overawed him for ever. But Thou didst think too highlyyooof men therein, for they are slaves, of course, though rebellious byyoonature. Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have passed, look uponyoothem. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I swear, man is weaker andyoobaser by nature than Thou hast believed him! Can he, can he do what Thouyoodidst? By showing him so much respect, Thou didst, as it were, cease toyoofeel for him, for Thou didst ask far too much from him—Thou who hast lovedyoohim more than Thyself! Respecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked lessyooof him. That would have been more like love, for his burden would haveyoobeen lighter. He is weak and vile. What though he is everywhere nowyoorebelling against our power, and proud of his rebellion? It is the prideyooof a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting and barringyooout the teacher at school. But their childish delight will end; it willyoocost them dear. They will cast down temples and drench the earth withyooblood. But they will see at last, the foolish children, that, though theyyooare rebels, they are impotent rebels, unable to keep up their ownyoorebellion. Bathed in their foolish tears, they will recognize at last thatyooHe who created them rebels must have meant to mock at them. They will sayyoothis in despair, and their utterance will be a blasphemy which will makeyoothem more unhappy still, for man’s nature cannot bear blasphemy, and inyoothe end always avenges it on itself. And so unrest, confusion andyoounhappiness—that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear so muchyoofor their freedom! The great prophet tells in vision and in image, that heyoosaw all those who took part in the first resurrection and that there wereyooof each tribe twelve thousand. But if there were so many of them, theyyoomust have been not men but gods. They had borne Thy cross, they hadyooendured scores of years in the barren, hungry wilderness, living uponyoolocusts and roots—and Thou mayest indeed point with pride at thoseyoochildren of freedom, of free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for Thyyooname. But remember that they were only some thousands; and what of theyoorest? And how are the other weak ones to blame, because they could notyooendure what the strong have endured? How is the weak soul to blame that ityoois unable to receive such terrible gifts? Canst Thou have simply come toyoothe elect and for the elect? But if so, it is a mystery and we cannotyoounderstand it. And if it is a mystery, we too have a right to preach ayoomystery, and to teach them that it’s not the free judgment of theiryoohearts, not love that matters, but a mystery which they must followyooblindly, even against their conscience. So we have done. We have correctedyooThy work and have founded it upon _miracle_, _mystery_ and _authority_.yooAnd men rejoiced that they were again led like sheep, and that theyooterrible gift that had brought them such suffering was, at last, liftedyoofrom their hearts. Were we right teaching them this? Speak! Did we notyoolove mankind, so meekly acknowledging their feebleness, lovinglyyoolightening their burden, and permitting their weak nature even sin withyooour sanction? Why hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou lookyoosilently and searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes? Be angry. I don’t wantyooThy love, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for me to hide anythingyoofrom Thee? Don’t I know to Whom I am speaking? All that I can say is knownyooto Thee already. And is it for me to conceal from Thee our mystery?yooPerhaps it is Thy will to hear it from my lips. Listen, then. We are notyooworking with Thee, but with _him_—that is our mystery. It’s long—eightyoocenturies—since we have been on _his_ side and not on Thine. Just eightyoocenturies ago, we took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn, thatyoolast gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of the earth. Weyootook from him Rome and the sword of Cæsar, and proclaimed ourselves soleyoorulers of the earth, though hitherto we have not been able to complete ouryoowork. But whose fault is that? Oh, the work is only beginning, but it hasyoobegun. It has long to await completion and the earth has yet much toyoosuffer, but we shall triumph and shall be Cæsars, and then we shall planyoothe universal happiness of man. But Thou mightest have taken even then theyoosword of Cæsar. Why didst Thou reject that last gift? Hadst Thou acceptedyoothat last counsel of the mighty spirit, Thou wouldst have accomplished allyoothat man seeks on earth—that is, some one to worship, some one to keep hisyooconscience, and some means of uniting all in one unanimous and harmoniousyooant-heap, for the craving for universal unity is the third and lastyooanguish of men. Mankind as a whole has always striven to organize ayoouniversal state. There have been many great nations with great histories,yoobut the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, foryoothey felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide union.yooThe great conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans, whirled like hurricanesyooover the face of the earth striving to subdue its people, and they tooyoowere but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universalyoounity. Hadst Thou taken the world and Cæsar’s purple, Thou wouldst haveyoofounded the universal state and have given universal peace. For who canyoorule men if not he who holds their conscience and their bread in hisyoohands? We have taken the sword of Cæsar, and in taking it, of course, haveyoorejected Thee and followed _him_. Oh, ages are yet to come of theyooconfusion of free thought, of their science and cannibalism. For havingyoobegun to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course,yoowith cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feetyooand spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon the beast andyooraise the cup, and on it will be written, “Mystery.” But then, and onlyyoothen, the reign of peace and happiness will come for men. Thou art proudyooof Thine elect, but Thou hast only the elect, while we give rest to all.yooAnd besides, how many of those elect, those mighty ones who could becomeyooelect, have grown weary waiting for Thee, and have transferred and willyootransfer the powers of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to theyooother camp, and end by raising their _free_ banner against Thee. Thouyoodidst Thyself lift up that banner. But with us all will be happy and willyoono more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. Oh, we shallyoopersuade them that they will only become free when they renounce theiryoofreedom to us and submit to us. And shall we be right or shall we beyoolying? They will be convinced that we are right, for they will rememberyoothe horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them.yooFreedom, free thought and science, will lead them into such straits andyoowill bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries,yoothat some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves,yooothers, rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest,yooweak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: “Yes,yooyou were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back to you,yoosave us from ourselves!”yooyoo“ ‘Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the breadyoomade by their hands from them, to give it to them, without any miracle.yooThey will see that we do not change the stones to bread, but in truth theyyoowill be more thankful for taking it from our hands than for the breadyooitself! For they will remember only too well that in old days, without ouryoohelp, even the bread they made turned to stones in their hands, whileyoosince they have come back to us, the very stones have turned to bread inyootheir hands. Too, too well will they know the value of completeyoosubmission! And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is most toyooblame for their not knowing it?—speak! Who scattered the flock and sent ityooastray on unknown paths? But the flock will come together again and willyoosubmit once more, and then it will be once for all. Then we shall giveyoothem the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are byyoonature. Oh, we shall persuade them at last not to be proud, for Thou didstyoolift them up and thereby taught them to be proud. We shall show them thatyoothey are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlikeyoohappiness is the sweetest of all. They will become timid and will look toyoous and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen. They will marvelyooat us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be proud at our beingyooso powerful and clever, that we have been able to subdue such a turbulentyooflock of thousands of millions. They will tremble impotently before ouryoowrath, their minds will grow fearful, they will be quick to shed tearsyoolike women and children, but they will be just as ready at a sign from usyooto pass to laughter and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes,yoowe shall set them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make theiryoolife like a child’s game, with children’s songs and innocent dance. Oh, weyooshall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they will loveyoous like children because we allow them to sin. We shall tell them thatyooevery sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission, that weyooallow them to sin because we love them, and the punishment for these sinsyoowe take upon ourselves. And we shall take it upon ourselves, and they willyooadore us as their saviors who have taken on themselves their sins beforeyooGod. And they will have no secrets from us. We shall allow or forbid themyooto live with their wives and mistresses, to have or not to haveyoochildren—according to whether they have been obedient or disobedient—andyoothey will submit to us gladly and cheerfully. The most painful secrets ofyootheir conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have anyooanswer for all. And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it willyoosave them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure at presentyooin making a free decision for themselves. And all will be happy, all theyoomillions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them. Foryooonly we, we who guard the mystery, shall be unhappy. There will beyoothousands of millions of happy babes, and a hundred thousand sufferers whoyoohave taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil.yooPeacefully they will die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, andyoobeyond the grave they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep theyoosecret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward ofyooheaven and eternity. Though if there were anything in the other world, ityoocertainly would not be for such as they. It is prophesied that Thou wiltyoocome again in victory, Thou wilt come with Thy chosen, the proud andyoostrong, but we will say that they have only saved themselves, but we haveyoosaved all. We are told that the harlot who sits upon the beast, and holdsyooin her hands the _mystery_, shall be put to shame, that the weak will riseyooup again, and will rend her royal purple and will strip naked heryooloathsome body. But then I will stand up and point out to Thee theyoothousand millions of happy children who have known no sin. And we who haveyootaken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before Thee andyoosay: “Judge us if Thou canst and darest.” Know that I fear Thee not. Knowyoothat I too have been in the wilderness, I too have lived on roots andyoolocusts, I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast blessed men, and Iyootoo was striving to stand among Thy elect, among the strong and powerful,yoothirsting “to make up the number.” But I awakened and would not serveyoomadness. I turned back and joined the ranks of those _who have correctedyooThy work_. I left the proud and went back to the humble, for the happinessyooof the humble. What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion willyoobe built up. I repeat, to-morrow Thou shalt see that obedient flock who atyooa sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about the pile onyoowhich I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us. For if any one has everyoodeserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I shall burn Thee. _Dixi._’ ”yooyooIvan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with excitement;yoowhen he had finished, he suddenly smiled.yooyooAlyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly moved andyooseemed several times on the point of interrupting, but restrained himself.yooNow his words came with a rush.yooyoo“But ... that’s absurd!” he cried, flushing. “Your poem is in praise ofyooJesus, not in blame of Him—as you meant it to be. And who will believe youyooabout freedom? Is that the way to understand it? That’s not the idea of ityooin the Orthodox Church.... That’s Rome, and not even the whole of Rome,yooit’s false—those are the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, theyooJesuits!... And there could not be such a fantastic creature as youryooInquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Whoyooare these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselvesyoofor the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen? We know theyooJesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not what youyoodescribe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They are simply theyooRomish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, withyoothe Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that’s their ideal, but there’s noyoosort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it.... It’s simple lust ofyoopower, of filthy earthly gain, of domination—something like a universalyooserfdom with them as masters—that’s all they stand for. They don’t evenyoobelieve in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.”yooyoo“Stay, stay,” laughed Ivan, “how hot you are! A fantasy you say, let it beyooso! Of course it’s a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you really thinkyoothat the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothingyoobut the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain? Is that Father Païssy’syooteaching?”yooyoo“No, no, on the contrary, Father Païssy did once say something rather theyoosame as you ... but of course it’s not the same, not a bit the same,”yooAlyosha hastily corrected himself.yooyoo“A precious admission, in spite of your ‘not a bit the same.’ I ask youyoowhy your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile materialyoogain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great sorrowyooand loving humanity? You see, only suppose that there was one such manyooamong all those who desire nothing but filthy material gain—if there’syooonly one like my old Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desertyooand made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free andyooperfect. But yet all his life he loved humanity, and suddenly his eyesyoowere opened, and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attainyooperfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the conviction thatyoomillions of God’s creatures have been created as a mockery, that they willyoonever be capable of using their freedom, that these poor rebels can neveryooturn into giants to complete the tower, that it was not for such geeseyoothat the great idealist dreamt his dream of harmony. Seeing all that heyooturned back and joined—the clever people. Surely that could haveyoohappened?”yooyoo“Joined whom, what clever people?” cried Alyosha, completely carried away.yoo“They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and secrets....yooPerhaps nothing but Atheism, that’s all their secret. Your Inquisitor doesyoonot believe in God, that’s his secret!”yooyoo“What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It’s perfectly true, it’syootrue that that’s the whole secret, but isn’t that suffering, at least foryooa man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the desert and yet couldyoonot shake off his incurable love of humanity? In his old age he reachedyoothe clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirityoocould build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly,yoo‘incomplete, empirical creatures created in jest.’ And so, convinced ofyoothis, he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, theyoodread spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying andyoodeception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and yetyoodeceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are beingyooled, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way thinkyoothemselves happy. And note, the deception is in the name of Him in Whoseyooideal the old man had so fervently believed all his life long. Is not thatyootragic? And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army ‘filledyoowith the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain’—would not oneyoosuch be enough to make a tragedy? More than that, one such standing at theyoohead is enough to create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church withyooall its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea. I tell you frankly that Iyoofirmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stoodyooat the head of the movement. Who knows, there may have been some such evenyooamong the Roman Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed oldyooman who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found evenyoonow in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by chance but byyooagreement, as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of theyoomystery, to guard it from the weak and the unhappy, so as to make themyoohappy. No doubt it is so, and so it must be indeed. I fancy that evenyooamong the Masons there’s something of the same mystery at the bottom, andyoothat that’s why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivalsyoobreaking up the unity of the idea, while it is so essential that thereyooshould be one flock and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my ideayooI might be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.”yooyoo“You are perhaps a Mason yourself!” broke suddenly from Alyosha. “Youyoodon’t believe in God,” he added, speaking this time very sorrowfully. Heyoofancied besides that his brother was looking at him ironically. “How doesyooyour poem end?” he asked, suddenly looking down. “Or was it the end?”yooyoo“I meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking heyoowaited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence weighed downyooupon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the time,yoolooking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply. The old manyoolonged for Him to say something, however bitter and terrible. But Heyoosuddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him on hisyoobloodless aged lips. That was all His answer. The old man shuddered. Hisyoolips moved. He went to the door, opened it, and said to Him: ‘Go, and comeyoono more ... come not at all, never, never!’ And he let Him out into theyoodark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went away.”yooyoo“And the old man?”yooyoo“The kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea.”yooyoo“And you with him, you too?” cried Alyosha, mournfully.yooyooIvan laughed.yooyoo“Why, it’s all nonsense, Alyosha. It’s only a senseless poem of ayoosenseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do youyootake it so seriously? Surely you don’t suppose I am going straight off toyoothe Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His work? Good Lord, it’syoono business of mine. I told you, all I want is to live on to thirty, andyoothen ... dash the cup to the ground!”yooyoo“But the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the blue sky,yooand the woman you love! How will you live, how will you love them?”yooAlyosha cried sorrowfully. “With such a hell in your heart and your head,yoohow can you? No, that’s just what you are going away for, to join them ...yooif not, you will kill yourself, you can’t endure it!”yooyoo“There is a strength to endure everything,” Ivan said with a cold smile.yooyoo“What strength?”yooyoo“The strength of the Karamazovs—the strength of the Karamazov baseness.”yooyoo“To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption, yes?”yooyoo“Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape it,yooand then—”yooyoo“How will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That’s impossibleyoowith your ideas.”yooyoo“In the Karamazov way, again.”yooyoo“ ‘Everything is lawful,’ you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?”yooyooIvan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.yooyoo“Ah, you’ve caught up yesterday’s phrase, which so offended Miüsov—andyoowhich Dmitri pounced upon so naïvely, and paraphrased!” he smiled queerly.yoo“Yes, if you like, ‘everything is lawful’ since the word has been said. Iyoowon’t deny it. And Mitya’s version isn’t bad.”yooyooAlyosha looked at him in silence.yooyoo“I thought that going away from here I have you at least,” Ivan saidyoosuddenly, with unexpected feeling; “but now I see that there is no placeyoofor me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, ‘all is lawful,’ Iyoowon’t renounce—will you renounce me for that, yes?”yooyooAlyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.yooyoo“That’s plagiarism,” cried Ivan, highly delighted. “You stole that from myyoopoem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it’s time we were going, both ofyoous.”yooyooThey went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of theyoorestaurant.yooyoo“Listen, Alyosha,” Ivan began in a resolute voice, “if I am really able toyoocare for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering you.yooIt’s enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I shan’t lose myyoodesire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as a declaration ofyoolove if you like. And now you go to the right and I to the left. And it’syooenough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I don’t go away to-morrow (Iyoothink I certainly shall go) and we meet again, don’t say a word more onyoothese subjects. I beg that particularly. And about Dmitri too, I ask youyoospecially, never speak to me again,” he added, with sudden irritation;yoo“it’s all exhausted, it has all been said over and over again, hasn’t it?yooAnd I’ll make you one promise in return for it. When at thirty, I want toyoo‘dash the cup to the ground,’ wherever I may be I’ll come to have one moreyootalk with you, even though it were from America, you may be sure of that.yooI’ll come on purpose. It will be very interesting to have a look at you,yooto see what you’ll be by that time. It’s rather a solemn promise, you see.yooAnd we really may be parting for seven years or ten. Come, go now to youryooPater Seraphicus, he is dying. If he dies without you, you will be angryyoowith me for having kept you. Good-by, kiss me once more; that’s right, nowyoogo.”yooyooIvan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back. It was just asyooDmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been veryyoodifferent. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyosha’syoomind in the distress and dejection of that moment. He waited a little,yoolooking after his brother. He suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as heyoowalked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his left. He hadyoonever noticed it before. But all at once he turned too, and almost ran toyoothe monastery. It was nearly dark, and he felt almost frightened;yoosomething new was growing up in him for which he could not account. Theyoowind had risen again as on the previous evening, and the ancient pinesyoomurmured gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse. He almostyooran. “Pater Seraphicus—he got that name from somewhere—where from?”yooAlyosha wondered. “Ivan, poor Ivan, and when shall I see you again?...yooHere is the hermitage. Yes, yes, that he is, Pater Seraphicus, he willyoosave me—from him and for ever!”yooyooSeveral times afterwards he wondered how he could on leaving Ivan soyoocompletely forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that morning, only ayoofew hours before, so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up doingyooso, even should he be unable to return to the monastery that night.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. For Awhile A Very Obscure OneyooyooyooAnd Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s house.yooBut, strange to say, he was overcome by insufferable depression, whichyoogrew greater at every step he took towards the house. There was nothingyoostrange in his being depressed; what was strange was that Ivan could notyoohave said what was the cause of it. He had often been depressed before,yooand there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, whenyoohe had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and wasyoopreparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new, unknownyoofuture. He would again be as solitary as ever, and though he had greatyoohopes, and great—too great—expectations from life, he could not have givenyooany definite account of his hopes, his expectations, or even his desires.yooyooYet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknownyoocertainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him was somethingyooquite different. “Is it loathing for my father’s house?” he wondered.yoo“Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though it’s the last time I shallyoocross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it.... No, it’s not thatyooeither. Is it the parting with Alyosha and the conversation I had withyoohim? For so many years I’ve been silent with the whole world and notyoodeigned to speak, and all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.”yooIt certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthfulyooinexperience and vanity—vexation at having failed to express himself,yooespecially with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainlyyoobeen reckoning. No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have doneyooindeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. “I feel sick withyoodepression and yet I can’t tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps.”yooyooIvan tried “not to think,” but that, too, was no use. What made hisyoodepression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual,yooexternal character—he felt that. Some person or thing seemed to beyoostanding out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude itselfyooupon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or conversation thatyoofor a long time one does not notice it, yet it irritates and almostyootorments one till at last one realizes, and removes the offending object,yoooften quite a trifling and ridiculous one—some article left about in theyoowrong place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on theyooshelf, and so on.yooyooAt last, feeling very cross and ill-humored, Ivan arrived home, andyoosuddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed what wasyoofretting and worrying him.yooyooOn a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying theyoocoolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him Ivan knew that theyoovalet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it was this man that his soulyooloathed. It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear. Just before,yoowhen Alyosha had been telling him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he hadyoofelt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirredyooresponsive anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked, Smerdyakov hadyoobeen forgotten for the time; but still he had been in his mind, and asyoosoon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgottenyoosensation began to obtrude itself again. “Is it possible that a miserable,yoocontemptible creature like that can worry me so much?” he wondered, withyooinsufferable irritation.yooyooIt was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike for theyooman, especially during the last few days. He had even begun to notice inyoohimself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the creature.yooPerhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when Ivan first cameyooto the neighborhood he had felt quite differently. Then he had taken ayoomarked interest in Smerdyakov, and had even thought him very original. Heyoohad encouraged him to talk to him, although he had always wondered at ayoocertain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind, and could notyoounderstand what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon theyoobrain of “the contemplative.” They discussed philosophical questions andyooeven how there could have been light on the first day when the sun, moon,yooand stars were only created on the fourth day, and how that was to beyoounderstood. But Ivan soon saw that, though the sun, moon, and stars mightyoobe an interesting subject, yet that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov,yooand that he was looking for something altogether different. In one way andyooanother, he began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too,yooand that Ivan disliked. It had first given rise to his aversion. Later on,yoothere had been trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on the scene, andyoothere had been the scandals with his brother Dmitri—they discussed that,yootoo. But though Smerdyakov always talked of that with great excitement, ityoowas impossible to discover what he desired to come of it. There was, inyoofact, something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some ofyoohis desires, accidentally betrayed and always vaguely expressed.yooSmerdyakov was always inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviouslyyoopremeditated questions, but what his object was he did not explain, andyoousually at the most important moment he would break off and relapse intoyoosilence or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated Ivan mostyooand confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting familiarityyoowhich Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly. Not that he forgotyoohimself and was rude; on the contrary, he always spoke very respectfully,yooyet he had obviously begun to consider—goodness knows why!—that there wasyoosome sort of understanding between him and Ivan Fyodorovitch. He alwaysyoospoke in a tone that suggested that those two had some kind of compact,yoosome secret between them, that had at some time been expressed on bothyoosides, only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those aroundyoothem. But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of hisyoogrowing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the root ofyooit.yooyooWith a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at the gateyoowithout speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov rose from theyoobench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew instantly that he wantedyooparticularly to talk to him. Ivan looked at him and stopped, and the factyoothat he did stop, instead of passing by, as he meant to the minute before,yoodrove him to fury. With anger and repulsion he looked at Smerdyakov’syooemasculate, sickly face, with the little curls combed forward on hisyooforehead. His left eye winked and he grinned as if to say, “Where are youyoogoing? You won’t pass by; you see that we two clever people have somethingyooto say to each other.”yooyooIvan shook. “Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with you?” wasyooon the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment he heardyoohimself say, “Is my father still asleep, or has he waked?”yooyooHe asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise, and at once,yooagain to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For an instant he feltyooalmost frightened; he remembered it afterwards. Smerdyakov stood facingyoohim, his hands behind his back, looking at him with assurance and almostyooseverity.yooyoo“His honor is still asleep,” he articulated deliberately (“You were theyoofirst to speak, not I,” he seemed to say). “I am surprised at you, sir,”yoohe added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting his rightyoofoot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.yooyoo“Why are you surprised at me?” Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly, doing hisyooutmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing, with disgust, that heyoowas feeling intense curiosity and would not, on any account, have goneyooaway without satisfying it.yooyoo“Why don’t you go to Tchermashnya, sir?” Smerdyakov suddenly raised hisyooeyes and smiled familiarly. “Why I smile you must understand of yourself,yooif you are a clever man,” his screwed-up left eye seemed to say.yooyoo“Why should I go to Tchermashnya?” Ivan asked in surprise.yooyooSmerdyakov was silent again.yooyoo“Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,” he said at last, slowlyyooand apparently attaching no significance to his answer. “I put you offyoowith a secondary reason,” he seemed to suggest, “simply to say something.”yooyoo“Damn you! Speak out what you want!” Ivan cried angrily at last, passingyoofrom meekness to violence.yooyooSmerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up, butyoostill looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile.yooyoo“Substantially nothing—but just by way of conversation.”yooyooAnother silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute. Ivanyooknew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov stood beforeyoohim and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he would be angry oryoonot. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last he moved to get up. Smerdyakovyooseemed to seize the moment.yooyoo“I’m in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don’t know how to helpyoomyself,” he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last word heyoosighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.yooyoo“They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little children,”yooSmerdyakov went on. “I am speaking of your parent and your brother DmitriyooFyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get up directly and beginyooworrying me every minute, ‘Has she come? Why hasn’t she come?’ and so onyooup till midnight and even after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovnayoodoesn’t come (for very likely she does not mean to come at all) then heyoowill be at me again to-morrow morning, ‘Why hasn’t she come? When will sheyoocome?’—as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it’s no better.yooAs soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother will appear with hisyoogun in his hands: ‘Look out, you rogue, you soup-maker. If you miss heryooand don’t let me know she’s been—I’ll kill you before any one.’ When theyoonight’s over, in the morning, he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, beginsyooworrying me to death. ‘Why hasn’t she come? Will she come soon?’ And he,yootoo, thinks me to blame because his lady hasn’t come. And every day andyooevery hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shallyookill myself in a fright. I can’t depend upon them, sir.”yooyoo“And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for DmitriyooFyodorovitch?” said Ivan irritably.yooyoo“How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven’t meddled at all, ifyooyou want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet from the veryyoobeginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on me to be his servant.yooHe has had only one thing to say since: ‘I’ll kill you, you scoundrel, ifyooyou miss her,’ I feel certain, sir, that I shall have a long fityooto-morrow.”yooyoo“What do you mean by ‘a long fit’?”yooyoo“A long fit, lasting a long time—several hours, or perhaps a day or two.yooOnce it went on for three days. I fell from the garret that time. Theyoostruggling ceased and then began again, and for three days I couldn’t comeyooback to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Herzenstube, the doctoryoohere, and he put ice on my head and tried another remedy, too.... I mightyoohave died.”yooyoo“But they say one can’t tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming. Whatyoomakes you say you will have one to-morrow?” Ivan inquired, with ayoopeculiar, irritable curiosity.yooyoo“That’s just so. You can’t tell beforehand.”yooyoo“Besides, you fell from the garret then.”yooyoo“I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret againyooto-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps. I have to goyoointo the cellar every day, too.”yooyooIvan took a long look at him.yooyoo“You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don’t quite understand you,” heyoosaid softly, but with a sort of menace. “Do you mean to pretend to be illyooto-morrow for three days, eh?”yooyooSmerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing with the toeyooof his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one forward, and,yoogrinning, articulated:yooyoo“If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fit—andyooit would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them—I should have ayooperfect right to use such a means to save myself from death. For even ifyooAgrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father while I am ill, his honoryoocan’t blame a sick man for not telling him. He’d be ashamed to.”yooyoo“Hang it all!” Ivan cried, his face working with anger, “why are youyooalways in such a funk for your life? All my brother Dmitri’s threats areyooonly hasty words and mean nothing. He won’t kill you; it’s not you he’llyookill!”yooyoo“He’d kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that, I amyooafraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does somethingyoocrazy to his father.”yooyoo“Why should you be taken for an accomplice?”yooyoo“They’ll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the signals as ayoogreat secret.”yooyoo“What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more plainly.”yooyoo“I’m bound to admit the fact,” Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic composure,yoo“that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in this business. As you knowyooyourself (if only you do know it) he has for several days past lockedyoohimself in as soon as night or even evening comes on. Of late you’ve beenyoogoing upstairs to your room early every evening, and yesterday you did notyoocome down at all, and so perhaps you don’t know how carefully he has begunyooto lock himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes toyoothe door he won’t open to him till he hears his voice. But GrigoryyooVassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him alone in his roomyoonow. That’s the arrangement he made himself ever since this to-do withyooAgrafena Alexandrovna began. But at night, by his orders, I go away to theyoolodge so that I don’t get to sleep till midnight, but am on the watch,yoogetting up and walking about the yard, waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovnayooto come. For the last few days he’s been perfectly frantic expecting her.yooWhat he argues is, she is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as heyoocalls him), ‘and so,’ says he, ‘she’ll come the back-way, late at night,yooto me. You look out for her,’ says he, ‘till midnight and later; and ifyooshe does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window from theyoogarden. Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then three times moreyooquickly, then,’ says he, ‘I shall understand at once that she has come,yooand will open the door to you quietly.’ Another signal he gave me in caseyooanything unexpected happens. At first, two knocks, and then, after anyoointerval, another much louder. Then he will understand that something hasyoohappened suddenly and that I must see him, and he will open to me so thatyooI can go and speak to him. That’s all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can’tyoocome herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch mightyoocome, too, so I must let him know he is near. His honor is awfully afraidyooof Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna had come andyoowere locked in with him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch were to turn up anywhereyoonear at the time, I should be bound to let him know at once, knockingyoothree times. So that the first signal of five knocks means AgrafenayooAlexandrovna has come, while the second signal of three knocks meansyoo‘something important to tell you.’ His honor has shown me them severalyootimes and explained them. And as in the whole universe no one knows ofyoothese signals but myself and his honor, so he’d open the door without theyooslightest hesitation and without calling out (he is awfully afraid ofyoocalling out aloud). Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitchyootoo, now.”yooyoo“How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you tell him?”yooyoo“It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it back fromyoohim? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day, ‘You are deceiving me,yooyou are hiding something from me! I’ll break both your legs for you.’ So Iyootold him those secret signals that he might see my slavish devotion, andyoomight be satisfied that I was not deceiving him, but was telling him all Iyoocould.”yooyoo“If you think that he’ll make use of those signals and try to get in,yoodon’t let him in.”yooyoo“But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him coming inyoothen, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate he is?”yooyoo“Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit, confoundyooyou? Are you laughing at me?”yooyoo“How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor with this fearyooon me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a presentiment. Frightyooalone will bring it on.”yooyoo“Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch. LetyooGrigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.”yooyoo“I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the signalsyoowithout orders from my master. And as for Grigory Vassilyevitch hearingyoohim and not admitting him, he has been ill ever since yesterday, and MarfayooIgnatyevna intends to give him medicine to-morrow. They’ve just arrangedyooit. It’s a very strange remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows of ayoopreparation and always keeps it. It’s a strong thing made from some herb.yooShe has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory Vassilyevitchyoothree times a year when his lumbago’s so bad he is almost paralyzed by it.yooThen she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and rubs his whole backyoofor half an hour till it’s quite red and swollen, and what’s left in theyoobottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer; but not quite all,yoofor on such occasions she leaves some for herself, and drinks it herself.yooAnd as they never take strong drink, I assure you they both drop asleep atyooonce and sleep sound a very long time. And when Grigory Vassilyevitchyoowakes up he is perfectly well after it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has ayooheadache from it. So, if Marfa Ignatyevna carries out her intentionyooto-morrow, they won’t hear anything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch.yooThey’ll be asleep.”yooyoo“What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though it wereyooplanned. You’ll have a fit and they’ll both be unconscious,” cried Ivan.yoo“But aren’t you trying to arrange it so?” broke from him suddenly, and heyoofrowned threateningly.yooyoo“How could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on DmitriyooFyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything, he’ll do it;yoobut if not, I shan’t be thrusting him upon his father.”yooyoo“And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you sayyooyourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won’t come at all?” Ivan went on, turningyoowhite with anger. “You say that yourself, and all the while I’ve beenyoohere, I’ve felt sure it was all the old man’s fancy, and the creatureyoowon’t come to him. Why should Dmitri break in on him if she doesn’t come?yooSpeak, I want to know what you are thinking!”yooyoo“You know yourself why he’ll come. What’s the use of what I think? Hisyoohonor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious on account ofyoomy illness perhaps, and he’ll dash in, as he did yesterday throughyooimpatience to search the rooms, to see whether she hasn’t escaped him onyoothe sly. He is perfectly well aware, too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has a bigyooenvelope with three thousand roubles in it, tied up with ribbon and sealedyoowith three seals. On it is written in his own hand, ‘To my angelyooGrushenka, if she will come,’ to which he added three days later, ‘for myyoolittle chicken.’ There’s no knowing what that might do.”yooyoo“Nonsense!” cried Ivan, almost beside himself. “Dmitri won’t come to stealyoomoney and kill my father to do it. He might have killed him yesterday onyooaccount of Grushenka, like the frantic, savage fool he is, but he won’tyoosteal.”yooyoo“He is in very great need of money now—the greatest need, IvanyooFyodorovitch. You don’t know in what need he is,” Smerdyakov explained,yoowith perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. “He looks on thatyoothree thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself. ‘My father stillyooowes me just three thousand,’ he said. And besides that, consider, IvanyooFyodorovitch, there is something else perfectly true. It’s as good asyoocertain, so to say, that Agrafena Alexandrovna will force him, if only sheyoocares to, to marry her—the master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch—ifyooonly she cares to, and of course she may care to. All I’ve said is thatyooshe won’t come, but maybe she’s looking for more than that—I mean to beyoomistress here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughingyoowith her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all ayoostupid thing to do. And she’s got plenty of sense. She wouldn’t marry ayoobeggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into consideration, IvanyooFyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourselfyooand your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, would have anything after theyoomaster’s death, not a rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry himyoosimply to get hold of the whole, all the money there is. But if youryoofather were to die now, there’d be some forty thousand for sure, even foryooDmitri Fyodorovitch whom he hates so, for he’s made no will.... DmitriyooFyodorovitch knows all that very well.”yooyooA sort of shudder passed over Ivan’s face. He suddenly flushed.yooyoo“Then why on earth,” he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, “do you advise meyooto go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by that? If I go away, you seeyoowhat will happen here.” Ivan drew his breath with difficulty.yooyoo“Precisely so,” said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivanyoointently, however.yooyoo“What do you mean by ‘precisely so’?” Ivan questioned him, with a menacingyoolight in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.yooyoo“I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I shouldyoosimply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,”yooanswered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan’s flashingyooeyes. They were both silent.yooyoo“You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what’s more ... an awful scoundrel,yootoo.” Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straightyoothrough the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Somethingyoostrange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched hisyoofists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. Theyoolatter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back.yooBut the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned inyoosilence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.yooyoo“I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know—early to-morrowyoomorning. That’s all!” he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himselfyooafterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov.yooyoo“That’s the best thing you can do,” he responded, as though he hadyooexpected to hear it; “except that you can always be telegraphed for fromyooMoscow, if anything should happen here.”yooyooIvan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But a changeyoohad passed over him, too. All his familiarity and carelessness hadyoocompletely disappeared. His face expressed attention and expectation,yoointent but timid and cringing.yooyoo“Haven’t you something more to say—something to add?” could be read in theyoointent gaze he fixed on Ivan.yooyoo“And couldn’t I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too—in case anythingyoohappened?” Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason raising hisyoovoice.yooyoo“From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,” Smerdyakov muttered,yooalmost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing intently into Ivan’syooeyes.yooyoo“Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to save myyoospending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out of my way, thatyooyou insist on Tchermashnya?”yooyoo“Precisely so ...” muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He lookedyooat Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw back. But toyoohis astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went through the gate stillyoolaughing. Any one who had seen his face at that moment would have knownyoothat he was not laughing from lightness of heart, and he could not haveyooexplained himself what he was feeling at that instant. He moved and walkedyooas though in a nervous frenzy.yooyooyooyooChapter VII. “It’s Always Worth While Speaking To A Clever Man”yooyooyooAnd in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor Pavlovitchyooin the drawing-room directly he went in, he shouted to him, waving hisyoohands, “I am going upstairs to my room, not in to you. Good-by!” andyoopassed by, trying not even to look at his father. Very possibly the oldyooman was too hateful to him at that moment; but such an unceremoniousyoodisplay of hostility was a surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the oldyooman evidently wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meetyoohim in the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, heyoostood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son goingyooupstairs, till he passed out of sight.yooyoo“What’s the matter with him?” he promptly asked Smerdyakov, who hadyoofollowed Ivan.yooyoo“Angry about something. Who can tell?” the valet muttered evasively.yooyoo“Confound him! Let him be angry then. Bring in the samovar, and get alongyoowith you. Look sharp! No news?”yooyooThen followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just complainedyooof to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor, and these questions weyoowill omit. Half an hour later the house was locked, and the crazy old manyoowas wandering along through the rooms in excited expectation of hearingyooevery minute the five knocks agreed upon. Now and then he peered out intoyoothe darkness, seeing nothing.yooyooIt was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat up lateyoothat night, till two o’clock. But we will not give an account of hisyoothoughts, and this is not the place to look into that soul—its turn willyoocome. And even if one tried, it would be very hard to give an account ofyoothem, for there were no thoughts in his brain, but something very vague,yooand, above all, intense excitement. He felt himself that he had lost hisyoobearings. He was fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and almostyoosurprising desires; for instance, after midnight he suddenly had anyoointense irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to theyoolodge and beat Smerdyakov. But if he had been asked why, he could not haveyoogiven any exact reason, except perhaps that he loathed the valet as oneyoowho had insulted him more gravely than any one in the world. On the otheryoohand, he was more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicableyoohumiliating terror, which he felt positively paralyzed his physicalyoopowers. His head ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred was ranklingyooin his heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on some one. He evenyoohated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had just had with him. Atyoomoments he hated himself intensely. Of Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgotyooto think, and wondered greatly at this afterwards, especially as heyooremembered perfectly that when he had protested so valiantly to KaterinayooIvanovna that he would go away next day to Moscow, something had whisperedyooin his heart, “That’s nonsense, you are not going, and it won’t be so easyyooto tear yourself away as you are boasting now.”yooyooRemembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with peculiaryoorepulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and had stealthily, asyoothough he were afraid of being watched, opened the door, gone out on theyoostaircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch stirring down below, hadyoolistened a long while—some five minutes—with a sort of strange curiosity,yooholding his breath while his heart throbbed. And why he had done all this,yoowhy he was listening, he could not have said. That “action” all his lifeyooafterwards he called “infamous,” and at the bottom of his heart, heyoothought of it as the basest action of his life. For Fyodor Pavlovitchyoohimself he felt no hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curiousyooto know how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing now.yooHe wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of the dark windowsyooand stopping in the middle of the room, listening, listening—for some oneyooto knock. Ivan went out on to the stairs twice to listen like this.yooyooAbout two o’clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor Pavlovitchyoohad gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved to fall asleep atyooonce, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did fall asleep at once, andyooslept soundly without dreams, but waked early, at seven o’clock, when ityoowas broad daylight. Opening his eyes, he was surprised to feel himselfyooextraordinarily vigorous. He jumped up at once and dressed quickly; thenyoodragged out his trunk and began packing immediately. His linen had comeyooback from the laundress the previous morning. Ivan positively smiled atyoothe thought that everything was helping his sudden departure. And hisyoodeparture certainly was sudden. Though Ivan had said the day before (toyooKaterina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was leaving next day,yooyet he remembered that he had no thought of departure when he went to bed,yooor, at least, had not dreamed that his first act in the morning would beyooto pack his trunk. At last his trunk and bag were ready. It was about nineyooo’clock when Marfa Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, “Where willyooyour honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?” He lookedyooalmost cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and gestures,yoosomething hurried and scattered. Greeting his father affably, and evenyooinquiring specially after his health, though he did not wait to hear hisyooanswer to the end, he announced that he was starting off in an hour toyooreturn to Moscow for good, and begged him to send for the horses. Hisyoofather heard this announcement with no sign of surprise, and forgot in anyoounmannerly way to show regret at losing him. Instead of doing so, he flewyoointo a great flutter at the recollection of some important business of hisyooown.yooyoo“What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never mind; we’ll manageyooit all the same. Do me a great service, my dear boy. Go to Tchermashnya onyoothe way. It’s only to turn to the left from the station at Volovya, onlyyooanother twelve versts and you come to Tchermashnya.”yooyoo“I’m sorry, I can’t. It’s eighty versts to the railway and the trainyoostarts for Moscow at seven o’clock to-night. I can only just catch it.”yooyoo“You’ll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off toyooTchermashnya. It won’t put you out much to humor your father! If I hadn’tyoohad something to keep me here, I would have run over myself long ago, foryooI’ve some business there in a hurry. But here I ... it’s not the time foryoome to go now.... You see, I’ve two pieces of copse land there. TheyooMaslovs, an old merchant and his son, will give eight thousand for theyootimber. But last year I just missed a purchaser who would have givenyootwelve. There’s no getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs haveyooit all their own way. One has to take what they’ll give, for no one hereyoodare bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursdayyoothat a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up. What makesyoohim valuable is that he is not from these parts, so he is not afraid ofyoothe Maslovs. He says he will give me eleven thousand for the copse. Do youyoohear? But he’ll only be here, the priest writes, for a week altogether, soyooyou must go at once and make a bargain with him.”yooyoo“Well, you write to the priest; he’ll make the bargain.”yooyoo“He can’t do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect treasure, I’dyoogive him twenty thousand to take care of for me without a receipt; but heyoohas no eye for business, he is a perfect child, a crow could deceive him.yooAnd yet he is a learned man, would you believe it? This Gorstkin looksyoolike a peasant, he wears a blue kaftan, but he is a regular rogue. That’syoothe common complaint. He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that youyoowonder why he is doing it. He told me the year before last that his wifeyoowas dead and that he had married another, and would you believe it, thereyoowas not a word of truth in it? His wife has never died at all, she isyooalive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week. So what you haveyooto find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth, when he says heyoowants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.”yooyoo“I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.”yooyoo“Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the signs byyoowhich you can judge about Gorstkin. I’ve done business with him a longyootime. You see, you must watch his beard; he has a nasty, thin, red beard.yooIf his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross, it’s all right, he isyoosaying what he means, he wants to do business. But if he strokes his beardyoowith his left hand and grins—he is trying to cheat you. Don’t watch hisyooeyes, you won’t find out anything from his eyes, he is a deep one, ayoorogue—but watch his beard! I’ll give you a note and you show it to him.yooHe’s called Gorstkin, though his real name is Lyagavy(4); but don’t callyoohim so, he will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him, andyoosee it’s all right, write here at once. You need only write: ‘He’s notyoolying.’ Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock off, butyoonot more. Just think! there’s a difference between eight thousand andyooeleven thousand. It’s as good as picking up three thousand; it’s not soyooeasy to find a purchaser, and I’m in desperate need of money. Only let meyooknow it’s serious, and I’ll run over and fix it up. I’ll snatch the timeyoosomehow. But what’s the good of my galloping over, if it’s all a notion ofyoothe priest’s? Come, will you go?”yooyoo“Oh, I can’t spare the time. You must excuse me.”yooyoo“Come, you might oblige your father. I shan’t forget it. You’ve no heart,yooany of you—that’s what it is? What’s a day or two to you? Where are youyoogoing now—to Venice? Your Venice will keep another two days. I would haveyoosent Alyosha, but what use is Alyosha in a thing like that? I send youyoojust because you are a clever fellow. Do you suppose I don’t see that? Youyooknow nothing about timber, but you’ve got an eye. All that is wanted is toyoosee whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his beard—if hisyoobeard shakes you know he is in earnest.”yooyoo“You force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself, then?” criedyooIvan, with a malignant smile.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy, butyoohe caught the smile.yooyoo“Then you’ll go, you’ll go? I’ll scribble the note for you at once.”yooyoo“I don’t know whether I shall go. I don’t know. I’ll decide on the way.”yooyoo“Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you settle theyoomatter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he’ll send it on to meyooat once. And I won’t delay you more than that. You can go to Venice. Theyoopriest will give you horses back to Volovya station.”yooyooThe old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent for theyoohorses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor Pavlovitchyoowas pleased, he usually became expansive, but to-day he seemed to restrainyoohimself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a word. He was quiteyoounmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something toyoosay. Ivan noticed this particularly. “He must be bored with me,” heyoothought. Only when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old manyoobegan to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to holdyooout his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it at once, andyooinstantly pulled himself up.yooyoo“Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!” he repeated from the steps.yoo“You’ll come again some time or other? Mind you do come. I shall always beyooglad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!”yooyooIvan got into the carriage.yooyoo“Good-by, Ivan! Don’t be too hard on me!” the father called for the lastyootime.yooyooThe whole household came out to take leave—Smerdyakov, Marfa and Grigory.yooIvan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated himself in theyoocarriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.yooyoo“You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,” broke suddenly from Ivan. Again,yooas the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and he laughed,yootoo, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it long after.yooyoo“It’s a true saying then, that ‘it’s always worth while speaking to ayooclever man,’ ” answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at Ivan.yooyooThe carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivan’s soul, but he lookedyooeagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees, at a flockyooof geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all of a sudden heyoofelt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver, and he felt intenselyyoointerested in an answer the peasant made him; but a minute later heyoorealized that he was not catching anything, and that he had not reallyyooeven taken in the peasant’s answer. He was silent, and it was pleasantyooeven so. The air was fresh, pure and cool, the sky bright. The images ofyooAlyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind. But he softly smiled,yooblew softly on the friendly phantoms, and they flew away. “There’s plentyyooof time for them,” he thought. They reached the station quickly, changedyoohorses, and galloped to Volovya. “Why is it worth while speaking to ayooclever man? What did he mean by that?” The thought seemed suddenly toyooclutch at his breathing. “And why did I tell him I was going toyooTchermashnya?” They reached Volovya station. Ivan got out of the carriage,yooand the drivers stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelveyooversts to Tchermashnya. He told them to harness the horses. He went intoyoothe station house, looked round, glanced at the overseer’s wife, andyoosuddenly went back to the entrance.yooyoo“I won’t go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway by seven,yoobrothers?”yooyoo“We shall just do it. Shall we get the carriage out?”yooyoo“At once. Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow?”yooyoo“To be sure. Mitri here will.”yooyoo“Can you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my father’s, to Fyodor PavlovitchyooKaramazov, and tell him I haven’t gone to Tchermashnya. Can you?”yooyoo“Of course I can. I’ve known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.”yooyoo“And here’s something for you, for I dare say he won’t give you anything,”yoosaid Ivan, laughing gayly.yooyoo“You may depend on it he won’t.” Mitya laughed too. “Thank you, sir. I’llyoobe sure to do it.”yooyooAt seven o’clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow “Away withyoothe past. I’ve done with the old world for ever, and may I have no news,yoono echo, from it. To a new life, new places and no looking back!” Butyooinstead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom, and his heartyooached with such anguish, as he had never known in his life before. He wasyoothinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when heyoowas approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation.yooyoo“I am a scoundrel,” he whispered to himself.yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son off. Foryootwo hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy. Butyoosuddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant foryooevery one in the house, and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch’syooequanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fellyoodown from the top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in theyooyard and heard him in time. She did not see the fall, but heard hisyooscream—the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to her—the scream ofyoothe epileptic falling in a fit. They could not tell whether the fit hadyoocome on him at the moment he was descending the steps, so that he mustyoohave fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the shock that hadyoocaused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be liable to them. Theyyoofound him at the bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions andyoofoaming at the mouth. It was thought at first that he must have brokenyoosomething—an arm or a leg—and hurt himself, but “God had preserved him,”yooas Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it—nothing of the kind had happened. But ityoowas difficult to get him out of the cellar. They asked the neighbors toyoohelp and managed it somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at theyoowhole ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick man didyoonot regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but thenyoobegan again, and every one concluded that the same thing would happen, asyoohad happened a year before, when he accidentally fell from the garret.yooThey remembered that ice had been put on his head then. There was stillyooice in the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up. In theyooevening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived atyooonce. He was a most estimable old man, and the most careful andyooconscientious doctor in the province. After careful examination, heyooconcluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have seriousyooconsequences; that meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand it,yoobut that by to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, heyoowould venture to try something else. The invalid was taken to the lodge,yooto a room next to Grigory’s and Marfa Ignatyevna’s.yooyooThen Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up withyoothat day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the soup, compared withyooSmerdyakov’s, was “no better than dish-water,” and the fowl was so driedyooup that it was impossible to masticate it. To her master’s bitter, thoughyoodeserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a veryyooold one to begin with, and that she had never been trained as a cook. Inyoothe evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; heyoowas informed that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days,yoowas completely laid up by his lumbago. Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his teayooas early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house. He was inyooterrible excitement and suspense. That evening he reckoned on Grushenka’syoocoming almost as a certainty. He had received from Smerdyakov that morningyooan assurance “that she had promised to come without fail.” Theyooincorrigible old man’s heart throbbed with excitement; he paced up andyoodown his empty rooms listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might beyooon the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the windowyoo(Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her whereyooand how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be ayoosecond in the passage, for fear—which God forbid!—that she should beyoofrightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but neveryoohad his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he couldyoosay almost certainly that she would come!yooyooyooyooyooBook VI. The Russian MonkyooyooyooyooChapter I. Father Zossima And His VisitorsyooyooyooWhen with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder’s cell,yoohe stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his last gasp,yooperhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw him sitting upyooin his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face was bright andyoocheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyfulyooconversation. But he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an houryoobefore Alyosha’s arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cellyooearlier, waiting for him to wake, having received a most confidentyooassurance from Father Païssy that “the teacher would get up, and as he hadyoohimself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to hisyooheart.” This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder FatheryooPaïssy put implicit trust in. If he had seen him unconscious, if he hadyooseen him breathe his last, and yet had his promise that he would rise upyooand say good-by to him, he would not have believed perhaps even in death,yoobut would still have expected the dead man to recover and fulfill hisyoopromise. In the morning as he lay down to sleep, Father Zossima had toldyoohim positively: “I shall not die without the delight of anotheryooconversation with you, beloved of my heart. I shall look once more on youryoodear face and pour out my heart to you once again.” The monks, who hadyoogathered for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima, had allyoobeen his devoted friends for many years. There were four of them: FatheryooIosif and Father Païssy, Father Mihaïl, the warden of the hermitage, a manyoonot very old and far from being learned. He was of humble origin, ofyoostrong will and steadfast faith, of austere appearance, but of deepyootenderness, though he obviously concealed it as though he were almostyooashamed of it. The fourth, Father Anfim, was a very old and humble littleyoomonk of the poorest peasant class. He was almost illiterate, and veryyooquiet, scarcely speaking to any one. He was the humblest of the humble,yooand looked as though he had been frightened by something great and awfulyoobeyond the scope of his intelligence. Father Zossima had a great affectionyoofor this timorous man, and always treated him with marked respect, thoughyooperhaps there was no one he had known to whom he had said less, in spiteyooof the fact that he had spent years wandering about holy Russia with him.yooThat was very long ago, forty years before, when Father Zossima firstyoobegan his life as a monk in a poor and little monastery at Kostroma, andyoowhen, shortly after, he had accompanied Father Anfim on his pilgrimage toyoocollect alms for their poor monastery.yooyooThe whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned before, wasyoovery small, so that there was scarcely room for the four of them (inyooaddition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood) to sit round Father Zossima onyoochairs brought from the sitting-room. It was already beginning to getyoodark, the room was lighted up by the lamps and the candles before theyooikons.yooyooSeeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father Zossima smiledyooat him joyfully and held out his hand.yooyoo“Welcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too. I knew youyoowould come.”yooyooAlyosha went up to him, bowed down before him to the ground and wept.yooSomething surged up from his heart, his soul was quivering, he wanted toyoosob.yooyoo“Come, don’t weep over me yet,” Father Zossima smiled, laying his rightyoohand on his head. “You see I am sitting up talking; maybe I shall liveyooanother twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from Vishegorye, withyooher little Lizaveta in her arms, wished me yesterday. God bless the motheryooand the little girl Lizaveta,” he crossed himself. “Porfiry, did you takeyooher offering where I told you?”yooyooHe meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the good-humoredyoowoman to be given “to some one poorer than me.” Such offerings, always ofyoomoney gained by personal toil, are made by way of penance voluntarilyyooundertaken. The elder had sent Porfiry the evening before to a widow,yoowhose house had been burnt down lately, and who after the fire had goneyoowith her children begging alms. Porfiry hastened to reply that he hadyoogiven the money, as he had been instructed, “from an unknownyoobenefactress.”yooyoo“Get up, my dear boy,” the elder went on to Alyosha. “Let me look at you.yooHave you been home and seen your brother?” It seemed strange to Alyoshayoothat he asked so confidently and precisely, about one of his brothersyooonly—but which one? Then perhaps he had sent him out both yesterday andyooto-day for the sake of that brother.yooyoo“I have seen one of my brothers,” answered Alyosha.yooyoo“I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.”yooyoo“I only saw him yesterday and could not find him to-day,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“Make haste to find him, go again to-morrow and make haste, leaveyooeverything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time to preventyoosomething terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in storeyoofor him.”yooyooHe was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words were strange.yooFather Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday, exchanged glancesyoowith Father Païssy. Alyosha could not resist asking:yooyoo“Father and teacher,” he began with extreme emotion, “your words are tooyooobscure.... What is this suffering in store for him?”yooyoo“Don’t inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as thoughyoohis whole future were expressed in his eyes. A look came into his eyes—soyoothat I was instantly horror-stricken at what that man is preparing foryoohimself. Once or twice in my life I’ve seen such a look in a man’s faceyoo... reflecting as it were his future fate, and that fate, alas, came toyoopass. I sent you to him, Alexey, for I thought your brotherly face wouldyoohelp him. But everything and all our fates are from the Lord. ‘Except ayoocorn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if ityoodie, it bringeth forth much fruit.’ Remember that. You, Alexey, I’ve manyyootimes silently blessed for your face, know that,” added the elder with ayoogentle smile. “This is what I think of you, you will go forth from theseyoowalls, but will live like a monk in the world. You will have many enemies,yoobut even your foes will love you. Life will bring you many misfortunes,yoobut you will find your happiness in them, and will bless life and willyoomake others bless it—which is what matters most. Well, that is youryoocharacter. Fathers and teachers,” he addressed his friends with a tenderyoosmile, “I have never till to-day told even him why the face of this youthyoois so dear to me. Now I will tell you. His face has been as it were ayooremembrance and a prophecy for me. At the dawn of my life when I was ayoochild I had an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen. Andyoolater on in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that thatyoobrother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me. For had heyoonot come into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at least, haveyoobecome a monk and entered on this precious path. He appeared first to meyooin my childhood, and here, at the end of my pilgrimage, he seems to haveyoocome to me over again. It is marvelous, fathers and teachers, that Alexey,yoowho has some, though not a great, resemblance in face, seems to me so likeyoohim spiritually, that many times I have taken him for that young man, myyoobrother, mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage, as ayooreminder and an inspiration. So that I positively wondered at so strange ayoodream in myself. Do you hear this, Porfiry?” he turned to the novice whoyoowaited on him. “Many times I’ve seen in your face as it were a look ofyoomortification that I love Alexey more than you. Now you know why that wasyooso, but I love you too, know that, and many times I grieved at youryoomortification. I should like to tell you, dear friends, of that youth, myyoobrother, for there has been no presence in my life more precious, moreyoosignificant and touching. My heart is full of tenderness, and I look at myyoowhole life at this moment as though living through it again.”yooyoo                  -------------------------------------yooyooHere I must observe that this last conversation of Father Zossima with theyoofriends who visited him on the last day of his life has been partlyyoopreserved in writing. Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov wrote it down fromyoomemory, some time after his elder’s death. But whether this was only theyooconversation that took place then, or whether he added to it his notes ofyooparts of former conversations with his teacher, I cannot determine. In hisyooaccount, Father Zossima’s talk goes on without interruption, as though heyootold his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is noyoodoubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening wasyoogeneral. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet theyyootoo talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides, FatheryooZossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he wasyoosometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay downyooto rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did notyooleave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted byyooFather Païssy’s reading the Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no oneyooof them supposed that he would die that night, for on that evening of hisyoolife after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found newyoostrength, which kept him up through this long conversation. It was like ayoolast effort of love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a littleyootime, however, for his life was cut short immediately.... But of thatyoolater. I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to theyooaccount given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be shorter and notyooso fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a greatyoodeal from previous conversations and added them to it.yooyoo                  -------------------------------------yooyooNotes of the Life of the deceased Priest and Monk, the Elder Zossima,yootaken from his own words by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.yooyooBIOGRAPHICAL NOTESyooyoo_(a)_ _Father Zossima’s Brother_yooyooBeloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in theyoonorth, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth, but of noyoogreat consequence or position. He died when I was only two years old, andyooI don’t remember him at all. He left my mother a small house built ofyoowood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient to keep her and heryoochildren in comfort. There were two of us, my elder brother Markel and I.yooHe was eight years older than I was, of hasty irritable temperament, butyookind-hearted and never ironical. He was remarkably silent, especially atyoohome with me, his mother, and the servants. He did well at school, but didyoonot get on with his schoolfellows, though he never quarreled, at least soyoomy mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was seventeen,yoohe made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscowyooto our town for freethinking, and led a solitary existence there. He was ayoogood scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university.yooSomething made him take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to seeyoohim. The young man would spend whole evenings with him during that winter,yootill the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his post again at hisyooown request, as he had powerful friends.yooyooIt was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was rude andyoolaughed at it. “That’s all silly twaddle, and there is no God,” he said,yoohorrifying my mother, the servants, and me too. For though I was onlyyoonine, I too was aghast at hearing such words. We had four servants, allyooserfs. I remember my mother selling one of the four, the cook Afimya, whoyoowas lame and elderly, for sixty paper roubles, and hiring a free servantyooto take her place.yooyooIn the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and had ayootendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin andyoodelicate-looking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose he caughtyoocold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to my mother that it wasyoogalloping consumption, that he would not live through the spring. Myyoomother began weeping, and, careful not to alarm my brother, she entreatedyoohim to go to church, to confess and take the sacrament, as he was stillyooable to move about. This made him angry, and he said something profaneyooabout the church. He grew thoughtful, however; he guessed at once that heyoowas seriously ill, and that that was why his mother was begging him toyooconfess and take the sacrament. He had been aware, indeed, for a long timeyoopast, that he was far from well, and had a year before coolly observed atyoodinner to our mother and me, “My life won’t be long among you, I may notyoolive another year,” which seemed now like a prophecy.yooyooThree days passed and Holy Week had come. And on Tuesday morning myyoobrother began going to church. “I am doing this simply for your sake,yoomother, to please and comfort you,” he said. My mother wept with joy andyoogrief. “His end must be near,” she thought, “if there’s such a change inyoohim.” But he was not able to go to church long, he took to his bed, so heyoohad to confess and take the sacrament at home.yooyooIt was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full ofyoofragrance. I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly, but inyoothe morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair. That’s how Iyooremember him sitting, sweet and gentle, smiling, his face bright andyoojoyous, in spite of his illness. A marvelous change passed over him, hisyoospirit seemed transformed. The old nurse would come in and say, “Let meyoolight the lamp before the holy image, my dear.” And once he would not haveyooallowed it and would have blown it out.yooyoo“Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you doing it.yooYou are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying when I rejoiceyooseeing you. So we are praying to the same God.”yooyooThose words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her room andyooweep, but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes and looked cheerful.yoo“Mother, don’t weep, darling,” he would say, “I’ve long to live yet, longyooto rejoice with you, and life is glad and joyful.”yooyoo“Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night,yoocoughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces.”yooyoo“Don’t cry, mother,” he would answer, “life is paradise, and we are all inyooparadise, but we won’t see it, if we would, we should have heaven on earthyoothe next day.”yooyooEvery one wondered at his words, he spoke so strangely and positively; weyoowere all touched and wept. Friends came to see us. “Dear ones,” he wouldyoosay to them, “what have I done that you should love me so, how can youyoolove any one like me, and how was it I did not know, I did not appreciateyooit before?”yooyooWhen the servants came in to him he would say continually, “Dear, kindyoopeople, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve to be waited on? Ifyooit were God’s will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men shouldyoowait on one another.”yooyooMother shook her head as she listened. “My darling, it’s your illnessyoomakes you talk like that.”yooyoo“Mother, darling,” he would say, “there must be servants and masters, butyooif so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as they are to me.yooAnd another thing, mother, every one of us has sinned against all men, andyooI more than any.”yooyooMother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears. “Why, howyoocould you have sinned against all men, more than all? Robbers andyoomurderers have done that, but what sin have you committed yet, that youyoohold yourself more guilty than all?”yooyoo“Mother, little heart of mine,” he said (he had begun using such strangeyoocaressing words at that time), “little heart of mine, my joy, believe me,yooevery one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything.yooI don’t know how to explain it to you, but I feel it is so, painfullyyooeven. And how is it we went on then living, getting angry and notyooknowing?”yooyooSo he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and full ofyoolove. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt, came:yooyoo“Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?” he would ask, joking.yooyoo“You’ll live many days yet,” the doctor would answer, “and months andyooyears too.”yooyoo“Months and years!” he would exclaim. “Why reckon the days? One day isyooenough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones, why do we quarrel,yootry to outshine each other and keep grudges against each other? Let’s goyoostraight into the garden, walk and play there, love, appreciate, and kissyooeach other, and glorify life.”yooyoo“Your son cannot last long,” the doctor told my mother, as she accompaniedyoohim to the door. “The disease is affecting his brain.”yooyooThe windows of his room looked out into the garden, and our garden was ayooshady one, with old trees in it which were coming into bud. The firstyoobirds of spring were flitting in the branches, chirruping and singing atyoothe windows. And looking at them and admiring them, he began suddenlyyoobegging their forgiveness too: “Birds of heaven, happy birds, forgive me,yoofor I have sinned against you too.” None of us could understand that atyoothe time, but he shed tears of joy. “Yes,” he said, “there was such ayooglory of God all about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; only I lived inyooshame and dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.”yooyoo“You take too many sins on yourself,” mother used to say, weeping.yooyoo“Mother, darling, it’s for joy, not for grief I am crying. Though I can’tyooexplain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for I don’t knowyoohow to love them enough. If I have sinned against every one, yet allyooforgive me, too, and that’s heaven. Am I not in heaven now?”yooyooAnd there was a great deal more I don’t remember. I remember I went onceyoointo his room when there was no one else there. It was a bright evening,yoothe sun was setting, and the whole room was lighted up. He beckoned me,yooand I went up to him. He put his hands on my shoulders and looked into myyooface tenderly, lovingly; he said nothing for a minute, only looked at meyoolike that.yooyoo“Well,” he said, “run and play now, enjoy life for me too.”yooyooI went out then and ran to play. And many times in my life afterwards Iyooremembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy life for him too. Thereyoowere many other marvelous and beautiful sayings of his, though we did notyoounderstand them at the time. He died the third week after Easter. He wasyoofully conscious though he could not talk; up to his last hour he did notyoochange. He looked happy, his eyes beamed and sought us, he smiled at us,yoobeckoned us. There was a great deal of talk even in the town about hisyoodeath. I was impressed by all this at the time, but not too much so,yoothough I cried a good deal at his funeral. I was young then, a child, butyooa lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all, remained in my heart,yooready to rise up and respond when the time came. So indeed it happened.yooyoo_(b) Of the Holy Scriptures in the Life of Father Zossima_yooyooI was left alone with my mother. Her friends began advising her to send meyooto Petersburg as other parents did. “You have only one son now,” theyyoosaid, “and have a fair income, and you will be depriving him perhaps of ayoobrilliant career if you keep him here.” They suggested I should be sent toyooPetersburg to the Cadet Corps, that I might afterwards enter the ImperialyooGuard. My mother hesitated for a long time, it was awful to part with heryooonly child, but she made up her mind to it at last, though not withoutyoomany tears, believing she was acting for my happiness. She brought me toyooPetersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw her again. Foryooshe too died three years afterwards. She spent those three years mourningyooand grieving for both of us.yooyooFrom the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but preciousyoomemories, for there are no memories more precious than those of earlyyoochildhood in one’s first home. And that is almost always so if there isyooany love and harmony in the family at all. Indeed, precious memories mayyooremain even of a bad home, if only the heart knows how to find what isyooprecious. With my memories of home I count, too, my memories of the Bible,yoowhich, child as I was, I was very eager to read at home. I had a book ofyooScripture history then with excellent pictures, called _A Hundred and FouryooStories from the Old and New Testament_, and I learned to read from it. Iyoohave it lying on my shelf now, I keep it as a precious relic of the past.yooBut even before I learned to read, I remember first being moved toyoodevotional feeling at eight years old. My mother took me alone to mass (Iyoodon’t remember where my brother was at the time) on the Monday beforeyooEaster. It was a fine day, and I remember to-day, as though I saw it now,yoohow the incense rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and,yoooverhead in the cupola, mingled in rising waves with the sunlight thatyoostreamed in at the little window. I was stirred by the sight, and for theyoofirst time in my life I consciously received the seed of God’s word in myyooheart. A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a big book,yooso large that at the time I fancied he could scarcely carry it. He laid ityooon the reading desk, opened it, and began reading, and suddenly for theyoofirst time I understood something read in the church of God. In the landyooof Uz, there lived a man, righteous and God-fearing, and he had greatyoowealth, so many camels, so many sheep and asses, and his children feasted,yooand he loved them very much and prayed for them. “It may be that my sonsyoohave sinned in their feasting.” Now the devil came before the Lordyootogether with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he had gone upyooand down the earth and under the earth. “And hast thou considered myyooservant Job?” God asked of him. And God boasted to the devil, pointing toyoohis great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at God’s words. “Giveyoohim over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy servant will murmur against Theeyooand curse Thy name.” And God gave up the just man He loved so, to theyoodevil. And the devil smote his children and his cattle and scattered hisyoowealth, all of a sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven. And Job rent hisyoomantle and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud, “Naked came I out ofyoomy mother’s womb, and naked shall I return into the earth; the Lord gaveyooand the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever andyooever.”yooyooFathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood rises upyooagain before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with the breast ofyooa little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and wonder andyoogladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination, and Satan, whoyootalked like that with God, and God who gave His servant up to destruction,yooand His servant crying out: “Blessed be Thy name although Thou dost punishyoome,” and then the soft and sweet singing in the church: “Let my prayeryoorise up before Thee,” and again incense from the priest’s censer and theyookneeling and the prayer. Ever since then—only yesterday I took it up—I’veyoonever been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how much thatyoois great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it! Afterwards I heardyoothe words of mockery and blame, proud words, “How could God give up theyoomost loved of His saints for the diversion of the devil, take from him hisyoochildren, smite him with sore boils so that he cleansed the corruptionyoofrom his sores with a pot-sherd—and for no object except to boast to theyoodevil! ‘See what My saint can suffer for My sake.’ ” But the greatness ofyooit lies just in the fact that it is a mystery—that the passing earthlyyooshow and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face of theyooearthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator, just as onyoothe first days of creation He ended each day with praise: “That is goodyoothat I have created,” looks upon Job and again praises His creation. AndyooJob, praising the Lord, serves not only Him but all His creation foryoogenerations and generations, and for ever and ever, since for that he wasyooordained. Good heavens, what a book it is, and what lessons there are inyooit! What a book the Bible is, what a miracle, what strength is given withyooit to man! It is like a mold cast of the world and man and human nature,yooeverything is there, and a law for everything for all the ages. And whatyoomysteries are solved and revealed! God raises Job again, gives him wealthyooagain. Many years pass by, and he has other children and loves them. Butyoohow could he love those new ones when those first children are no more,yoowhen he has lost them? Remembering them, how could he be fully happy withyoothose new ones, however dear the new ones might be? But he could, heyoocould. It’s the great mystery of human life that old grief passesyoogradually into quiet, tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the placeyooof the riotous blood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, asyoobefore, my hearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting,yooits long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that comeyoowith them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life—and overyooall the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving! My life isyooending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I feel how myyooearthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, that approachingyoolife, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture, my mindyooglowing and my heart weeping with joy.yooyooFriends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late one mayyoohear it more often, that the priests, and above all the village priests,yooare complaining on all sides of their miserable income and theiryoohumiliating lot. They plainly state, even in print—I’ve read ityoomyself—that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the people becauseyooof the smallness of their means, and if Lutherans and heretics come andyoolead the flock astray, they let them lead them astray because they have soyoolittle to live upon. May the Lord increase the sustenance that is soyooprecious to them, for their complaint is just, too. But of a truth I say,yooif any one is to blame in the matter, half the fault is ours. For he mayyoobe short of time, he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the whileyoowith work and services, but still it’s not all the time, even he has anyoohour a week to remember God. And he does not work the whole year round.yooLet him gather round him once a week, some hour in the evening, if onlyyoothe children at first—the fathers will hear of it and they too will beginyooto come. There’s no need to build halls for this, let him take them intoyoohis own cottage. They won’t spoil his cottage, they would only be thereyooone hour. Let him open that book and begin reading it without grand wordsyooor superciliousness, without condescension to them, but gently and kindly,yoobeing glad that he is reading to them and that they are listening withyooattention, loving the words himself, only stopping from time to time toyooexplain words that are not understood by the peasants. Don’t be anxious,yoothey will understand everything, the orthodox heart will understand all!yooLet him read them about Abraham and Sarah, about Isaac and Rebecca, of howyooJacob went to Laban and wrestled with the Lord in his dream and said,yoo“This place is holy”—and he will impress the devout mind of the peasant.yooLet him read, especially to the children, how the brothers sold Joseph,yoothe tender boy, the dreamer and prophet, into bondage, and told theiryoofather that a wild beast had devoured him, and showed him hisyooblood-stained clothes. Let him read them how the brothers afterwardsyoojourneyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler,yoounrecognized by them, tormented them, accused them, kept his brotheryooBenjamin, and all through love: “I love you, and loving you I tormentyooyou.” For he remembered all his life how they had sold him to theyoomerchants in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands,yoohe had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in ayoostrange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he loved themyoobeyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love. He left themyooat last not able to bear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on hisyoobed and wept. Then, wiping his tears away, he went out to them joyful andyootold them, “Brothers, I am your brother Joseph!” Let him read them furtheryoohow happy old Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive,yooand how he went to Egypt leaving his own country, and died in a foreignyooland, bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden inyoohis meek and timid heart all his life, that from his offspring, fromyooJudah, will come the great hope of the world, the Messiah and Saviour.yooyooFathers and teachers, forgive me and don’t be angry, that like a littleyoochild I’ve been babbling of what you know long ago, and can teach me ayoohundred times more skillfully. I only speak from rapture, and forgive myyootears, for I love the Bible. Let him too weep, the priest of God, and beyoosure that the hearts of his listeners will throb in response. Only ayoolittle tiny seed is needed—drop it into the heart of the peasant and ityoowon’t die, it will live in his soul all his life, it will be hidden in theyoomidst of his darkness and sin, like a bright spot, like a great reminder.yooAnd there’s no need of much teaching or explanation, he will understand ityooall simply. Do you suppose that the peasants don’t understand? Try readingyoothem the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or theyoomiraculous story of Jonah in the whale. Don’t forget either the parablesyooof Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke (that is what Iyoodid), and then from the Acts of the Apostles the conversion of St. Paulyoo(that you mustn’t leave out on any account), and from the _Lives of theyooSaints_, for instance, the life of Alexey, the man of God and, greatest ofyooall, the happy martyr and the seer of God, Mary of Egypt—and you willyoopenetrate their hearts with these simple tales. Give one hour a week to ityooin spite of your poverty, only one little hour. And you will see foryooyourselves that our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you ayoohundred-fold. Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving wordsyoothey have heard from him, they will of their own accord help him in hisyoofields and in his house, and will treat him with more respect thanyoobefore—so that it will even increase his worldly well-being too. The thingyoois so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words, foryoofear of being laughed at, and yet how true it is! One who does not believeyooin God will not believe in God’s people. He who believes in God’s peopleyoowill see His Holiness too, even though he had not believed in it tillyoothen. Only the people and their future spiritual power will convert ouryooatheists, who have torn themselves away from their native soil.yooyooAnd what is the use of Christ’s words, unless we set an example? Theyoopeople is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst for theyooWord and for all that is good.yooyooIn my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over Russiayoowith Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and we stayed oneyoonight on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen. Ayoogood-looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined us; he had to hurry backyoonext morning to pull a merchant’s barge along the bank. I noticed himyoolooking straight before him with clear and tender eyes. It was a bright,yoowarm, still, July night, a cool mist rose from the broad river, we couldyoohear the plash of a fish, the birds were still, all was hushed andyoobeautiful, everything praying to God. Only we two were not sleeping, theyoolad and I, and we talked of the beauty of this world of God’s and of theyoogreat mystery of it. Every blade of grass, every insect, ant, and goldenyoobee, all so marvelously know their path, though they have notyoointelligence, they bear witness to the mystery of God and continuallyyooaccomplish it themselves. I saw the dear lad’s heart was moved. He told meyoothat he loved the forest and the forest birds. He was a bird-catcher, knewyoothe note of each of them, could call each bird. “I know nothing betteryoothan to be in the forest,” said he, “though all things are good.”yooyoo“Truly,” I answered him, “all things are good and fair, because all isyootruth. Look,” said I, “at the horse, that great beast that is so near toyooman; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him and works for him; look atyootheir faces, what meekness, what devotion to man, who often beats themyoomercilessly. What gentleness, what confidence and what beauty! It’syootouching to know that there’s no sin in them, for all, all except man, isyoosinless, and Christ has been with them before us.”yooyoo“Why,” asked the boy, “is Christ with them too?”yooyoo“It cannot but be so,” said I, “since the Word is for all. All creationyooand all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word, singing glory toyooGod, weeping to Christ, unconsciously accomplishing this by the mystery ofyootheir sinless life. Yonder,” said I, “in the forest wanders the dreadfulyoobear, fierce and menacing, and yet innocent in it.” And I told him howyooonce a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell inyoothe wood. And the great saint pitied him, went up to him without fear andyoogave him a piece of bread. “Go along,” said he, “Christ be with you,” andyoothe savage beast walked away meekly and obediently, doing no harm. And theyoolad was delighted that the bear had walked away without hurting the saint,yooand that Christ was with him too. “Ah,” said he, “how good that is, howyoogood and beautiful is all God’s work!” He sat musing softly and sweetly. Iyoosaw he understood. And he slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. MayyooGod bless youth! And I prayed for him as I went to sleep. Lord, send peaceyooand light to Thy people!yooyooyooyooChapter II. The Duelyooyooyoo_(c) Recollections of Father Zossima’s Youth before he became a Monk. TheyooDuel_yooyooI spent a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet school atyooPetersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings there, many of myyoochildish impressions grew dimmer, though I forgot nothing. I picked up soyoomany new habits and opinions that I was transformed into a cruel, absurd,yooalmost savage creature. A surface polish of courtesy and society manners Iyoodid acquire together with the French language.yooyooBut we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our service asyoocattle. I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect, for I was soyoomuch more impressionable than my companions. By the time we left theyooschool as officers, we were ready to lay down our lives for the honor ofyoothe regiment, but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning ofyoohonor, and if any one had known it, he would have been the first toyooridicule it. Drunkenness, debauchery and devilry were what we almostyooprided ourselves on. I don’t say that we were bad by nature, all theseyooyoung men were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all.yooWhat made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money, and so Iyooflung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged headlong into all theyoorecklessness of youth.yooyooI was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one book Iyoonever opened at that time, though I always carried it about with me, and Iyoowas never separated from it; in very truth I was keeping that book “foryoothe day and the hour, for the month and the year,” though I knew it not.yooyooAfter four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K. where ouryooregiment was stationed at the time. We found the people of the townyoohospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I met with a cordialyooreception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament and was known to beyoowell off, which always goes a long way in the world. And then ayoocircumstance happened which was the beginning of it all.yooyooI formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of nobleyooand lofty character, the daughter of people much respected. They wereyoowell-to-do people of influence and position. They always gave me a cordialyooand friendly reception. I fancied that the young lady looked on me withyoofavor and my heart was aflame at such an idea. Later on I saw and fullyyoorealized that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all,yoobut only recognized the elevation of her mind and character, which I couldyoonot indeed have helped doing. I was prevented, however, from making her anyoooffer at the time by my selfishness, I was loath to part with theyooallurements of my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of myyooyouth, and with my pockets full of money. I did drop some hint as to myyoofeelings however, though I put off taking any decisive step for a time.yooThen, all of a sudden, we were ordered off for two months to anotheryoodistrict.yooyooOn my return two months later, I found the young lady already married to ayoorich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man, still young though olderyoothan I was, connected with the best Petersburg society, which I was not,yooand of excellent education, which I also was not. I was so overwhelmed atyoothis unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded. Theyooworst of it all was that, as I learned then, the young landowner had beenyooa long while betrothed to her, and I had met him indeed many times in heryoohouse, but blinded by my conceit I had noticed nothing. And thisyooparticularly mortified me; almost everybody had known all about it, whileyooI knew nothing. I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury. With flushedyooface I began recalling how often I had been on the point of declaring myyoolove to her, and as she had not attempted to stop me or to warn me, sheyoomust, I concluded, have been laughing at me all the time. Later on, ofyoocourse, I reflected and remembered that she had been very far fromyoolaughing at me; on the contrary, she used to turn off any love-making onyoomy part with a jest and begin talking of other subjects; but at thatyoomoment I was incapable of reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge. Iyooam surprised to remember that my wrath and revengeful feelings wereyooextremely repugnant to my own nature, for being of an easy temper, I foundyooit difficult to be angry with any one for long, and so I had to workyoomyself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd.yooyooI waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my “rival” in theyoopresence of a large company. I insulted him on a perfectly extraneousyoopretext, jeering at his opinion upon an important public event—it was inyoothe year 1826(5)—and my jeer was, so people said, clever and effective.yooThen I forced him to ask for an explanation, and behaved so rudely that heyooaccepted my challenge in spite of the vast inequality between us, as I wasyooyounger, a person of no consequence, and of inferior rank. I learnedyooafterwards for a fact that it was from a jealous feeling on his side alsoyoothat my challenge was accepted; he had been rather jealous of me on hisyoowife’s account before their marriage; he fancied now that if he submittedyooto be insulted by me and refused to accept my challenge, and if she heardyooof it, she might begin to despise him and waver in her love for him. Iyoosoon found a second in a comrade, an ensign of our regiment. In those daysyoothough duels were severely punished, yet dueling was a kind of fashionyooamong the officers—so strong and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudiceyoosometimes be.yooyooIt was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at seven o’clockyoothe next day on the outskirts of the town—and then something happened thatyooin very truth was the turning-point of my life. In the evening, returningyoohome in a savage and brutal humor, I flew into a rage with my orderlyyooAfanasy, and gave him two blows in the face with all my might, so that ityoowas covered with blood. He had not long been in my service and I hadyoostruck him before, but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me,yoothough it’s forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I wentyooto bed and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day wasyoobreaking. I got up—I did not want to sleep any more—I went to theyoowindow—opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw the sun rising; ityoowas warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.yooyoo“What’s the meaning of it?” I thought. “I feel in my heart as it wereyoosomething vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to shed blood? No,”yooI thought, “I feel it’s not that. Can it be that I am afraid of death,yooafraid of being killed? No, that’s not it, that’s not it at all.”... Andyooall at once I knew what it was: it was because I had beaten Afanasy theyooevening before! It all rose before my mind, it all was as it were repeatedyooover again; he stood before me and I was beating him straight on the faceyooand he was holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixedyooupon me as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not evenyoodare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has beenyoobrought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature! What a crime! Ityoowas as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through. I stood as if Iyoowere struck dumb, while the sun was shining, the leaves were rejoicing andyoothe birds were trilling the praise of God.... I hid my face in my hands,yoofell on my bed and broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered myyoobrother Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants: “My dearyooones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your waitingyooon me?”yooyoo“Yes, am I worth it?” flashed through my mind. “After all what am I worth,yoothat another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness and image ofyooGod, should serve me?” For the first time in my life this question forcedyooitself upon me. He had said, “Mother, my little heart, in truth we areyooeach responsible to all for all, it’s only that men don’t know this. Ifyoothey knew it, the world would be a paradise at once.”yooyoo“God, can that too be false?” I thought as I wept. “In truth, perhaps, Iyooam more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner than all menyooin the world.” And all at once the whole truth in its full light appearedyooto me; what was I going to do? I was going to kill a good, clever, nobleyooman, who had done me no wrong, and by depriving his wife of happiness foryoothe rest of her life, I should be torturing and killing her too. I layyoothus in my bed with my face in the pillow, heedless how the time wasyoopassing. Suddenly my second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetchyoome.yooyoo“Ah,” said he, “it’s a good thing you are up already, it’s time we wereyoooff, come along!”yooyooI did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we went out toyoothe carriage, however.yooyoo“Wait here a minute,” I said to him. “I’ll be back directly, I haveyooforgotten my purse.”yooyooAnd I ran back alone, to Afanasy’s little room.yooyoo“Afanasy,” I said, “I gave you two blows on the face yesterday, forgiveyoome,” I said.yooyooHe started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I saw thatyooit was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer’s uniform, Iyoodropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.yooyoo“Forgive me,” I said.yooyooThen he was completely aghast.yooyoo“Your honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?”yooyooAnd he burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his hands,yooturned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I flew out to myyoocomrade and jumped into the carriage.yooyoo“Ready,” I cried. “Have you ever seen a conqueror?” I asked him. “Here isyooone before you.”yooyooI was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don’t remember whatyooabout.yooyooHe looked at me. “Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you’ll keep upyoothe honor of the uniform, I can see.”yooyooSo we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We were placedyootwelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood gayly, looking him fullyooin the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked lovingly at him, for Iyooknew what I would do. His shot just grazed my cheek and ear.yooyoo“Thank God,” I cried, “no man has been killed,” and I seized my pistol,yooturned back and flung it far away into the wood. “That’s the place foryooyou,” I cried.yooyooI turned to my adversary.yooyoo“Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,” I said, “for my unprovoked insultyooto you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am ten times worse than youyooand more, maybe. Tell that to the person whom you hold dearest in theyooworld.”yooyooI had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.yooyoo“Upon my word,” cried my adversary, annoyed, “if you did not want toyoofight, why did not you let me alone?”yooyoo“Yesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better,” I answered him gayly.yooyoo“As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is difficult toyooagree with your opinion,” said he.yooyoo“Bravo,” I cried, clapping my hands. “I agree with you there too. I haveyoodeserved it!”yooyoo“Will you shoot, sir, or not?”yooyoo“No, I won’t,” I said; “if you like, fire at me again, but it would beyoobetter for you not to fire.”yooyooThe seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: “Can you disgrace theyooregiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness! IfyooI’d only known this!”yooyooI stood facing them all, not laughing now.yooyoo“Gentlemen,” I said, “is it really so wonderful in these days to find ayooman who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his wrongdoing?”yooyoo“But not in a duel,” cried my second again.yooyoo“That’s what’s so strange,” I said. “For I ought to have owned my fault asyoosoon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before leading him into ayoogreat and deadly sin; but we have made our life so grotesque, that to actyooin that way would have been almost impossible, for only after I have facedyoohis shot at the distance of twelve paces could my words have anyyoosignificance for him, and if I had spoken before, he would have said, ‘Heyoois a coward, the sight of the pistols has frightened him, no use to listenyooto him.’ Gentlemen,” I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart,yoo“look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, theyootender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we,yooare sinful and foolish, and we don’t understand that life is heaven, foryoowe have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in allyooits beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.”yooyooI would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with the sweetnessyooand youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss in my heart as I hadyoonever known before in my life.yooyoo“All this as rational and edifying,” said my antagonist, “and in any caseyooyou are an original person.”yooyoo“You may laugh,” I said to him, laughing too, “but afterwards you willyooapprove of me.”yooyoo“Oh, I am ready to approve of you now,” said he; “will you shake hands?yoofor I believe you are genuinely sincere.”yooyoo“No,” I said, “not now, later on when I have grown worthier and deserveyooyour esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.”yooyooWe went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I kissed him. Allyoomy comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to passyoojudgment on me the same day.yooyoo“He has disgraced the uniform,” they said; “let him resign hisyoocommission.”yooyooSome stood up for me: “He faced the shot,” they said.yooyoo“Yes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness.”yooyoo“If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own pistolyoofirst before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded into the forest.yooNo, there’s something else in this, something original.”yooyooI enjoyed listening and looking at them. “My dear friends and comrades,”yoosaid I, “don’t worry about my resigning my commission, for I have done soyooalready. I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as I get myyoodischarge I shall go into a monastery—it’s with that object I am leavingyoothe regiment.”yooyooWhen I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.yooyoo“You should have told us of that first, that explains everything, we can’tyoojudge a monk.”yooyooThey laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully, but kindlyyooand merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even those who had beenyoosternest in their censure, and all the following month, before myyoodischarge came, they could not make enough of me. “Ah, you monk,” theyyoowould say. And every one said something kind to me, they began trying toyoodissuade me, even to pity me: “What are you doing to yourself?”yooyoo“No,” they would say, “he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and could haveyoofired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night before that heyooshould become a monk, that’s why he did it.”yooyooIt was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I had beenyookindly received, but had not been the object of special attention, and nowyooall came to know me at once and invited me; they laughed at me, but theyyooloved me. I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel,yoothe authorities took no notice of it, because my antagonist was a nearyoorelation of our general, and as there had been no bloodshed and no seriousyooconsequences, and as I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke. AndyooI began then to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter,yoofor it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter. These conversationsyoomostly took place in the evenings, in the company of ladies; womenyooparticularly liked listening to me then and they made the men listen.yooyoo“But how can I possibly be responsible for all?” every one would laugh inyoomy face. “Can I, for instance, be responsible for you?”yooyoo“You may well not know it,” I would answer, “since the whole world hasyoolong been going on a different line, since we consider the veriest lies asyootruth and demand the same lies from others. Here I have for once in myyoolife acted sincerely and, well, you all look upon me as a madman. Thoughyooyou are friendly to me, yet, you see, you all laugh at me.”yooyoo“But how can we help being friendly to you?” said my hostess, laughing.yooThe room was full of people. All of a sudden the young lady rose, on whoseyooaccount the duel had been fought and whom only lately I had intended to beyoomy future wife. I had not noticed her coming into the room. She got up,yoocame to me and held out her hand.yooyoo“Let me tell you,” she said, “that I am the first not to laugh at you, butyooon the contrary I thank you with tears and express my respect for you foryooyour action then.”yooyooHer husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and almostyookissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention was especiallyyoocaught by a middle-aged man who came up to me with the others. I knew himyooby name already, but had never made his acquaintance nor exchanged a wordyoowith him till that evening.yooyoo_(d) The Mysterious Visitor_yooyooHe had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent position,yoorespected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence. He subscribedyooconsiderable sums to the almshouse and the orphan asylum; he was veryyoocharitable, too, in secret, a fact which only became known after hisyoodeath. He was a man of about fifty, almost stern in appearance and notyoomuch given to conversation. He had been married about ten years and hisyoowife, who was still young, had borne him three children. Well, I wasyoositting alone in my room the following evening, when my door suddenlyyooopened and this gentleman walked in.yooyooI must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my formeryooquarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms with an oldyoolady, the widow of a government clerk. My landlady’s servant waited uponyoome, for I had moved into her rooms simply because on my return from theyooduel I had sent Afanasy back to the regiment, as I felt ashamed to lookyoohim in the face after my last interview with him. So prone is the man ofyoothe world to be ashamed of any righteous action.yooyoo“I have,” said my visitor, “with great interest listened to you speakingyooin different houses the last few days and I wanted at last to make youryoopersonal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately. Can you, dearyoosir, grant me this favor?”yooyoo“I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an honor.”yooI said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I impressedyoofrom the first moment by the appearance of this man. For though otheryoopeople had listened to me with interest and attention, no one had come toyoome before with such a serious, stern and concentrated expression. And nowyoohe had come to see me in my own rooms. He sat down.yooyoo“You are, I see, a man of great strength of character,” he said; “as youyoohave dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you risked incurringyoothe contempt of all.”yooyoo“Your praise is, perhaps, excessive,” I replied.yooyoo“No, it’s not excessive,” he answered; “believe me, such a course ofyooaction is far more difficult than you think. It is that which hasyooimpressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to you,” heyoocontinued. “Tell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed by my perhapsyoounseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations, if you can recallyoothem, at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiveness at theyooduel. Do not think my question frivolous; on the contrary, I have inyooasking the question a secret motive of my own, which I will perhapsyooexplain to you later on, if it is God’s will that we should become moreyoointimately acquainted.”yooyooAll the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight into the faceyooand I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great curiosity on myyooside also, for I felt that there was some strange secret in his soul.yooyoo“You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I asked myyooopponent’s forgiveness,” I answered; “but I had better tell you from theyoobeginning what I have not yet told any one else.” And I described all thatyoohad passed between Afanasy and me, and how I had bowed down to the groundyooat his feet. “From that you can see for yourself,” I concluded, “that atyoothe time of the duel it was easier for me, for I had made a beginningyooalready at home, and when once I had started on that road, to go fartheryooalong it was far from being difficult, but became a source of joy andyoohappiness.”yooyooI liked the way he looked at me as he listened. “All that,” he said, “isyooexceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and again.”yooyooAnd from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening. And weyooshould have become greater friends, if only he had ever talked of himself.yooBut about himself he scarcely ever said a word, yet continually asked meyooabout myself. In spite of that I became very fond of him and spoke withyooperfect frankness to him about all my feelings; “for,” thought I, “whatyooneed have I to know his secrets, since I can see without that that he is ayoogood man? Moreover, though he is such a serious man and my senior, heyoocomes to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal.” And Iyoolearned a great deal that was profitable from him, for he was a man ofyoolofty mind.yooyoo“That life is heaven,” he said to me suddenly, “that I have long beenyoothinking about”; and all at once he added, “I think of nothing elseyooindeed.” He looked at me and smiled. “I am more convinced of it than youyooare, I will tell you later why.”yooyooI listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell meyoosomething.yooyoo“Heaven,” he went on, “lies hidden within all of us—here it lies hidden inyoome now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow and for allyootime.”yooyooI looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazingyoomysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.yooyoo“And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own sins,yooyou were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how you couldyoocomprehend it in all its significance at once. And in very truth, so soonyooas men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not ayoodream, but a living reality.”yooyoo“And when,” I cried out to him bitterly, “when will that come to pass? andyoowill it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of ours?”yooyoo“What then, you don’t believe it,” he said. “You preach it and don’tyoobelieve it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will come toyoopass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every process has itsyoolaw. It’s a spiritual, psychological process. To transform the world, toyoorecreate it afresh, men must turn into another path psychologically. Untilyooyou have become really, in actual fact, a brother to every one,yoobrotherhood will not come to pass. No sort of scientific teaching, no kindyooof common interest, will ever teach men to share property and privilegesyoowith equal consideration for all. Every one will think his share too smallyooand they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another.yooYou ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we haveyooto go through the period of isolation.”yooyoo“What do you mean by isolation?” I asked him.yooyoo“Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age—it hasyoonot fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every oneyoostrives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secureyoothe greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all hisyooefforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, foryooinstead of self-realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. Allyoomankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each inyoohis own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has,yoofrom the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them.yooHe heaps up riches by himself and thinks, ‘How strong I am now and howyoosecure,’ and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heapsyooup, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he isyooaccustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from theyoowhole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in menyooand in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money andyoothe privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days menyoohave, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is toyoobe found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort.yooBut this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all willyoosuddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another.yooIt will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they haveyoosat so long in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of theyooSon of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must keepyoothe banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and hisyooconduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men’syoosouls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love,yoothat the great idea may not die.”yooyooOur evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and ferventyootalk. I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less frequently.yooBesides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not as blame, for theyyoostill loved me and treated me good-humoredly, but there’s no denying thatyoofashion is a great power in society. I began to regard my mysteriousyoovisitor with admiration, for besides enjoying his intelligence, I began toyooperceive that he was brooding over some plan in his heart, and wasyoopreparing himself perhaps for a great deed. Perhaps he liked my notyooshowing curiosity about his secret, not seeking to discover it by directyooquestion nor by insinuation. But I noticed at last, that he seemed to showyoosigns of wanting to tell me something. This had become quite evident,yooindeed, about a month after he first began to visit me.yooyoo“Do you know,” he said to me once, “that people are very inquisitive aboutyoous in the town and wonder why I come to see you so often. But let themyoowonder, for _soon all will be explained_.”yooyooSometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and almostyooalways on such occasions he would get up and go away. Sometimes he wouldyoofix a long piercing look upon me, and I thought, “He will say somethingyoodirectly now.” But he would suddenly begin talking of something ordinaryyooand familiar. He often complained of headache too.yooyooOne day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking with greatyoofervor a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and his face workedyooconvulsively, while he stared persistently at me.yooyoo“What’s the matter?” I said; “do you feel ill?”—he had just beenyoocomplaining of headache.yooyoo“I ... do you know ... I murdered some one.”yooyooHe said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. “Why is it he isyoosmiling?” The thought flashed through my mind before I realized anythingyooelse. I too turned pale.yooyoo“What are you saying?” I cried.yooyoo“You see,” he said, with a pale smile, “how much it has cost me to say theyoofirst word. Now I have said it, I feel I’ve taken the first step and shallyoogo on.”yooyooFor a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe him atyoothat time, but only after he had been to see me three days running andyootold me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended by being convinced,yooto my great grief and amazement. His crime was a great and terrible one.yooyooFourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner, a wealthyyooand handsome young woman who had a house in our town. He fell passionatelyyooin love with her, declared his feeling and tried to persuade her to marryyoohim. But she had already given her heart to another man, an officer ofyoonoble birth and high rank in the service, who was at that time away at theyoofront, though she was expecting him soon to return. She refused his offeryooand begged him not to come and see her. After he had ceased to visit her,yoohe took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter at night throughyoothe garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery. But, as often happens,yooa crime committed with extraordinary audacity is more successful thanyooothers.yooyooEntering the garret through the skylight, he went down the ladder, knowingyoothat the door at the bottom of it was sometimes, through the negligence ofyoothe servants, left unlocked. He hoped to find it so, and so it was. Heyoomade his way in the dark to her bedroom, where a light was burning. Asyoothough on purpose, both her maids had gone off to a birthday-party in theyoosame street, without asking leave. The other servants slept in theyooservants’ quarters or in the kitchen on the ground-floor. His passionyooflamed up at the sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous angeryootook possession of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, heyoothrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even cry out. Then withyoodevilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion should fall onyoothe servants. He was so base as to take her purse, to open her chest withyookeys from under her pillow, and to take some things from it, doing it allyooas it might have been done by an ignorant servant, leaving valuable papersyooand taking only money. He took some of the larger gold things, but leftyoosmaller articles that were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too,yoosome things for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having doneyoothis awful deed, he returned by the way he had come.yooyooNeither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any time after inyoohis life, did any one dream of suspecting that he was the criminal. No oneyooindeed knew of his love for her, for he was always reserved and silent andyoohad no friend to whom he would have opened his heart. He was looked uponyoosimply as an acquaintance, and not a very intimate one, of the murderedyoowoman, as for the previous fortnight he had not even visited her. A serfyooof hers called Pyotr was at once suspected, and every circumstanceyooconfirmed the suspicion. The man knew—indeed his mistress did not concealyoothe fact—that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit she had decidedyooto send him, as he had no relations and his conduct was unsatisfactory.yooPeople had heard him angrily threatening to murder her when he was drunkyooin a tavern. Two days before her death, he had run away, staying no oneyooknew where in the town. The day after the murder, he was found on the roadyooleading out of the town, dead drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and hisyooright hand happened to be stained with blood. He declared that his noseyoohad been bleeding, but no one believed him. The maids confessed that theyyoohad gone to a party and that the street-door had been left open till theyyooreturned. And a number of similar details came to light, throwingyoosuspicion on the innocent servant.yooyooThey arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week after theyooarrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious in theyoohospital. There the matter ended and the judges and the authorities andyooevery one in the town remained convinced that the crime had been committedyooby no one but the servant who had died in the hospital. And after that theyoopunishment began.yooyooMy mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he was not inyoothe least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was miserable a long time,yoobut not for that reason; only from regret that he had killed the woman heyooloved, that she was no more, that in killing her he had killed his love,yoowhile the fire of passion was still in his veins. But of the innocentyooblood he had shed, of the murder of a fellow creature, he scarcelyyoothought. The thought that his victim might have become the wife of anotheryooman was insupportable to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced inyoohis conscience that he could not have acted otherwise.yooyooAt first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness andyoodeath soon set his mind at rest, for the man’s death was apparently (so heyooreflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his fright, but a chillyoohe had taken on the day he ran away, when he had lain all night dead drunkyooon the damp ground. The theft of the money and other things troubled himyoolittle, for he argued that the theft had not been committed for gain butyooto avert suspicion. The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwardsyoosubscribed the whole of it, and much more, towards the funds foryoomaintaining an almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set hisyooconscience at rest about the theft, and it’s a remarkable fact that for ayoolong time he really was at peace—he told me this himself. He entered thenyooupon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for ayoodifficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and being ayooman of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he recalled it, heyootried not to think of it at all. He became active in philanthropy too,yoofounded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town, did a goodyoodeal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected ayoomember of philanthropic societies.yooyooAt last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain of ityoowas too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent girlyooand soon after married her, hoping that marriage would dispel his lonelyyoodepression, and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing hisyooduty to his wife and children, he would escape from old memoriesyooaltogether. But the very opposite of what he expected happened. He began,yooeven in the first month of his marriage, to be continually fretted by theyoothought, “My wife loves me—but what if she knew?” When she first told himyoothat she would soon bear him a child, he was troubled. “I am giving life,yoobut I have taken life.” Children came. “How dare I love them, teach andyooeducate them, how can I talk to them of virtue? I have shed blood.” Theyyoowere splendid children, he longed to caress them; “and I can’t look atyootheir innocent candid faces, I am unworthy.”yooyooAt last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of hisyoomurdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed, by the blood thatyoocried out for vengeance. He had begun to have awful dreams. But, being ayooman of fortitude, he bore his suffering a long time, thinking: “I shallyooexpiate everything by this secret agony.” But that hope, too, was vain;yoothe longer it went on, the more intense was his suffering.yooyooHe was respected in society for his active benevolence, though every oneyoowas overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But the more he wasyoorespected, the more intolerable it was for him. He confessed to me that heyoohad thoughts of killing himself. But he began to be haunted by anotheryooidea—an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable,yoothough at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake ityoooff. He dreamed of rising up, going out and confessing in the face of allyoomen that he had committed murder. For three years this dream had pursuedyoohim, haunting him in different forms. At last he believed with his wholeyooheart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul and would beyooat peace for ever. But this belief filled his heart with terror, for howyoocould he carry it out? And then came what happened at my duel.yooyoo“Looking at you, I have made up my mind.”yooyooI looked at him.yooyoo“Is it possible,” I cried, clasping my hands, “that such a trivialyooincident could give rise to such a resolution in you?”yooyoo“My resolution has been growing for the last three years,” he answered,yoo“and your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking at you, Iyooreproached myself and envied you.” He said this to me almost sullenly.yooyoo“But you won’t be believed,” I observed; “it’s fourteen years ago.”yooyoo“I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them.”yooyooThen I cried and kissed him.yooyoo“Tell me one thing, one thing,” he said (as though it all depended uponyoome), “my wife, my children! My wife may die of grief, and though myyoochildren won’t lose their rank and property, they’ll be a convict’syoochildren and for ever! And what a memory, what a memory of me I shallyooleave in their hearts!”yooyooI said nothing.yooyoo“And to part from them, to leave them for ever? It’s for ever, you know,yoofor ever!”yooyooI sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I got up at last, I felt afraid.yooyoo“Well?” He looked at me.yooyoo“Go!” said I, “confess. Everything passes, only the truth remains. Youryoochildren will understand, when they grow up, the nobility of youryooresolution.”yooyooHe left me that time as though he had made up his mind. Yet for more thanyooa fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening, still preparingyoohimself, still unable to bring himself to the point. He made my heartyooache. One day he would come determined and say fervently:yooyoo“I know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess. Fourteenyooyears I’ve been in hell. I want to suffer. I will take my punishment andyoobegin to live. You can pass through the world doing wrong, but there’s noyooturning back. Now I dare not love my neighbor nor even my own children.yooGood God, my children will understand, perhaps, what my punishment hasyoocost me and will not condemn me! God is not in strength but in truth.”yooyoo“All will understand your sacrifice,” I said to him, “if not at once, theyyoowill understand later; for you have served truth, the higher truth, not ofyoothe earth.”yooyooAnd he would go away seeming comforted, but next day he would come again,yoobitter, pale, sarcastic.yooyoo“Every time I come to you, you look at me so inquisitively as though toyoosay, ‘He has still not confessed!’ Wait a bit, don’t despise me too much.yooIt’s not such an easy thing to do, as you would think. Perhaps I shall notyoodo it at all. You won’t go and inform against me then, will you?”yooyooAnd far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity, I was afraid toyoolook at him at all. I was quite ill from anxiety, and my heart was full ofyootears. I could not sleep at night.yooyoo“I have just come from my wife,” he went on. “Do you understand what theyooword ‘wife’ means? When I went out, the children called to me, ‘Good-by,yoofather, make haste back to read _The Children’s Magazine_ with us.’ No,yooyou don’t understand that! No one is wise from another man’s woe.”yooyooHis eyes were glittering, his lips were twitching. Suddenly he struck theyootable with his fist so that everything on it danced—it was the first timeyoohe had done such a thing, he was such a mild man.yooyoo“But need I?” he exclaimed, “must I? No one has been condemned, no one hasyoobeen sent to Siberia in my place, the man died of fever. And I’ve beenyoopunished by my sufferings for the blood I shed. And I shan’t be believed,yoothey won’t believe my proofs. Need I confess, need I? I am ready to go onyoosuffering all my life for the blood I have shed, if only my wife andyoochildren may be spared. Will it be just to ruin them with me? Aren’t weyoomaking a mistake? What is right in this case? And will people recognizeyooit, will they appreciate it, will they respect it?”yooyoo“Good Lord!” I thought to myself, “he is thinking of other people’syoorespect at such a moment!” And I felt so sorry for him then, that Iyoobelieve I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him. I sawyoohe was beside himself. I was aghast, realizing with my heart as well as myyoomind what such a resolution meant.yooyoo“Decide my fate!” he exclaimed again.yooyoo“Go and confess,” I whispered to him. My voice failed me, but I whisperedyooit firmly. I took up the New Testament from the table, the Russianyootranslation, and showed him the Gospel of St. John, chapter xii. verse 24:yooyoo“Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into theyooground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth muchyoofruit.”yooyooI had just been reading that verse when he came in. He read it.yooyoo“That’s true,” he said, but he smiled bitterly. “It’s terrible the thingsyooyou find in those books,” he said, after a pause. “It’s easy enough toyoothrust them upon one. And who wrote them? Can they have been written byyoomen?”yooyoo“The Holy Spirit wrote them,” said I.yooyoo“It’s easy for you to prate,” he smiled again, this time almost withyoohatred.yooyooI took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him theyooEpistle to the Hebrews, chapter x. verse 31. He read:yooyoo“It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”yooyooHe read it and simply flung down the book. He was trembling all over.yooyoo“An awful text,” he said. “There’s no denying you’ve picked out fittingyooones.” He rose from the chair. “Well!” he said, “good-by, perhaps I shan’tyoocome again ... we shall meet in heaven. So I have been for fourteen yearsyoo‘in the hands of the living God,’ that’s how one must think of thoseyoofourteen years. To-morrow I will beseech those hands to let me go.”yooyooI wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him, but I did not dare—his faceyoowas contorted and somber. He went away.yooyoo“Good God,” I thought, “what has he gone to face!” I fell on my kneesyoobefore the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of God, our swiftyoodefender and helper. I was half an hour praying in tears, and it was late,yooabout midnight. Suddenly I saw the door open and he came in again. I wasyoosurprised.yooyoo“Where have you been?” I asked him.yooyoo“I think,” he said, “I’ve forgotten something ... my handkerchief, Iyoothink.... Well, even if I’ve not forgotten anything, let me stay ayoolittle.”yooyooHe sat down. I stood over him.yooyoo“You sit down, too,” said he.yooyooI sat down. We sat still for two minutes; he looked intently at me andyoosuddenly smiled—I remembered that—then he got up, embraced me warmly andyookissed me.yooyoo“Remember,” he said, “how I came to you a second time. Do you hear,yooremember it!”yooyooAnd he went out.yooyoo“To-morrow,” I thought.yooyooAnd so it was. I did not know that evening that the next day was hisyoobirthday. I had not been out for the last few days, so I had no chance ofyoohearing it from any one. On that day he always had a great gathering,yooevery one in the town went to it. It was the same this time. After dinneryoohe walked into the middle of the room, with a paper in his hand—a formalyoodeclaration to the chief of his department who was present. Thisyoodeclaration he read aloud to the whole assembly. It contained a fullyooaccount of the crime, in every detail.yooyoo“I cut myself off from men as a monster. God has visited me,” he said inyooconclusion. “I want to suffer for my sin!”yooyooThen he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had beenyookeeping for fourteen years, that he thought would prove his crime, theyoojewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had stolen to divertyoosuspicion, a cross and a locket taken from her neck with a portrait of heryoobetrothed in the locket, her notebook and two letters; one from heryoobetrothed, telling her that he would soon be with her, and her unfinishedyooanswer left on the table to be sent off next day. He carried off these twoyooletters—what for? Why had he kept them for fourteen years afterwardsyooinstead of destroying them as evidence against him?yooyooAnd this is what happened: every one was amazed and horrified, every oneyoorefused to believe it and thought that he was deranged, though allyoolistened with intense curiosity. A few days later it was fully decided andyooagreed in every house that the unhappy man was mad. The legal authoritiesyoocould not refuse to take the case up, but they too dropped it. Though theyootrinkets and letters made them ponder, they decided that even if they didyooturn out to be authentic, no charge could be based on those alone.yooBesides, she might have given him those things as a friend, or asked himyooto take care of them for her. I heard afterwards, however, that theyoogenuineness of the things was proved by the friends and relations of theyoomurdered woman, and that there was no doubt about them. Yet nothing wasyoodestined to come of it, after all.yooyooFive days later, all had heard that he was ill and that his life was inyoodanger. The nature of his illness I can’t explain, they said it was anyooaffection of the heart. But it became known that the doctors had beenyooinduced by his wife to investigate his mental condition also, and had comeyooto the conclusion that it was a case of insanity. I betrayed nothing,yoothough people ran to question me. But when I wanted to visit him, I wasyoofor a long while forbidden to do so, above all by his wife.yooyoo“It’s you who have caused his illness,” she said to me; “he was alwaysyoogloomy, but for the last year people noticed that he was peculiarlyyooexcited and did strange things, and now you have been the ruin of him.yooYour preaching has brought him to this; for the last month he was alwaysyoowith you.”yooyooIndeed, not only his wife but the whole town were down upon me and blamedyoome. “It’s all your doing,” they said. I was silent and indeed rejoiced atyooheart, for I saw plainly God’s mercy to the man who had turned againstyoohimself and punished himself. I could not believe in his insanity.yooyooThey let me see him at last, he insisted upon saying good-by to me. I wentyooin to him and saw at once, that not only his days, but his hours wereyoonumbered. He was weak, yellow, his hands trembled, he gasped for breath,yoobut his face was full of tender and happy feeling.yooyoo“It is done!” he said. “I’ve long been yearning to see you, why didn’t youyoocome?”yooyooI did not tell him that they would not let me see him.yooyoo“God has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know I am dying,yoobut I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years. There wasyooheaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to do. Now I dareyooto love my children and to kiss them. Neither my wife nor the judges, noryooany one has believed it. My children will never believe it either. I seeyooin that God’s mercy to them. I shall die, and my name will be without ayoostain for them. And now I feel God near, my heart rejoices as in Heavenyoo... I have done my duty.”yooyooHe could not speak, he gasped for breath, he pressed my hand warmly,yoolooking fervently at me. We did not talk for long, his wife kept peepingyooin at us. But he had time to whisper to me:yooyoo“Do you remember how I came back to you that second time, at midnight? Iyootold you to remember it. You know what I came back for? I came to killyooyou!”yooyooI started.yooyoo“I went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about the streets,yoostruggling with myself. And suddenly I hated you so that I could hardlyyoobear it. Now, I thought, he is all that binds me, and he is my judge. Iyoocan’t refuse to face my punishment to-morrow, for he knows all. It was notyoothat I was afraid you would betray me (I never even thought of that), butyooI thought, ‘How can I look him in the face if I don’t confess?’ And if youyoohad been at the other end of the earth, but alive, it would have been allyoothe same, the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowingyooeverything and condemning me. I hated you as though you were the cause, asyoothough you were to blame for everything. I came back to you then,yooremembering that you had a dagger lying on your table. I sat down andyooasked you to sit down, and for a whole minute I pondered. If I had killedyooyou, I should have been ruined by that murder even if I had not confessedyoothe other. But I didn’t think about that at all, and I didn’t want toyoothink of it at that moment. I only hated you and longed to revenge myselfyooon you for everything. The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart. But letyoome tell you, you were never nearer death.”yooyooA week later he died. The whole town followed him to the grave. The chiefyoopriest made a speech full of feeling. All lamented the terrible illnessyoothat had cut short his days. But all the town was up in arms against meyooafter the funeral, and people even refused to see me. Some, at first a fewyooand afterwards more, began indeed to believe in the truth of his story,yooand they visited me and questioned me with great interest and eagerness,yoofor man loves to see the downfall and disgrace of the righteous. But Iyooheld my tongue, and very shortly after, I left the town, and five monthsyoolater by God’s grace I entered upon the safe and blessed path, praisingyoothe unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it. But I remember inyoomy prayer to this day, the servant of God, Mihail, who suffered soyoogreatly.yooyooyooyooChapter III. Conversations And Exhortations Of Father Zossimayooyooyoo_(e) The Russian Monk and his possible Significance_yooyooFathers and teachers, what is the monk? In the cultivated world the wordyoois nowadays pronounced by some people with a jeer, and by others it isyooused as a term of abuse, and this contempt for the monk is growing. It isyootrue, alas, it is true, that there are many sluggards, gluttons,yooprofligates and insolent beggars among monks. Educated people point toyoothese: “You are idlers, useless members of society, you live on the laboryooof others, you are shameless beggars.” And yet how many meek and humbleyoomonks there are, yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace! Theseyooare less noticed, or passed over in silence. And how surprised men wouldyoobe if I were to say that from these meek monks, who yearn for solitaryyooprayer, the salvation of Russia will come perhaps once more! For they areyooin truth made ready in peace and quiet “for the day and the hour, theyoomonth and the year.” Meanwhile, in their solitude, they keep the image ofyooChrist fair and undefiled, in the purity of God’s truth, from the times ofyoothe Fathers of old, the Apostles and the martyrs. And when the time comesyoothey will show it to the tottering creeds of the world. That is a greatyoothought. That star will rise out of the East.yooyooThat is my view of the monk, and is it false? is it too proud? Look at theyooworldly and all who set themselves up above the people of God, has notyooGod’s image and His truth been distorted in them? They have science; butyooin science there is nothing but what is the object of sense. The spiritualyooworld, the higher part of man’s being is rejected altogether, dismissedyoowith a sort of triumph, even with hatred. The world has proclaimed theyooreign of freedom, especially of late, but what do we see in this freedomyooof theirs? Nothing but slavery and self-destruction! For the world says:yooyoo“You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as theyoomost rich and powerful. Don’t be afraid of satisfying them and evenyoomultiply your desires.” That is the modern doctrine of the world. In thatyoothey see freedom. And what follows from this right of multiplication ofyoodesires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envyyooand murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown theyoomeans of satisfying their wants. They maintain that the world is gettingyoomore and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community,yooas it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air.yooyooAlas, put no faith in such a bond of union. Interpreting freedom as theyoomultiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires, men distort their ownyoonature, for many senseless and foolish desires and habits and ridiculousyoofancies are fostered in them. They live only for mutual envy, for luxuryyooand ostentation. To have dinners, visits, carriages, rank and slaves toyoowait on one is looked upon as a necessity, for which life, honor and humanyoofeeling are sacrificed, and men even commit suicide if they are unable toyoosatisfy it. We see the same thing among those who are not rich, while theyoopoor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness. But soonyoothey will drink blood instead of wine, they are being led on to it. I askyooyou is such a man free? I knew one “champion of freedom” who told meyoohimself that, when he was deprived of tobacco in prison, he was soyoowretched at the privation that he almost went and betrayed his cause foryoothe sake of getting tobacco again! And such a man says, “I am fighting foryoothe cause of humanity.”yooyooHow can such a one fight? what is he fit for? He is capable perhaps ofyoosome action quickly over, but he cannot hold out long. And it’s no wonderyoothat instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into slavery, and insteadyooof serving the cause of brotherly love and the union of humanity haveyoofallen, on the contrary, into dissension and isolation, as my mysteriousyoovisitor and teacher said to me in my youth. And therefore the idea of theyooservice of humanity, of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind, isyoomore and more dying out in the world, and indeed this idea is sometimesyootreated with derision. For how can a man shake off his habits? What canyoobecome of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying theyooinnumerable desires he has created for himself? He is isolated, and whatyooconcern has he with the rest of humanity? They have succeeded inyooaccumulating a greater mass of objects, but the joy in the world has grownyooless.yooyooThe monastic way is very different. Obedience, fasting and prayer areyoolaughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real, true freedom. Iyoocut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I subdue my proud andyoowanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with God’s help I attainyoofreedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy. Which is most capable ofyooconceiving a great idea and serving it—the rich man in his isolation oryoothe man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things andyoohabits? The monk is reproached for his solitude, “You have secludedyooyourself within the walls of the monastery for your own salvation, andyoohave forgotten the brotherly service of humanity!” But we shall see whichyoowill be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love. For it is not we, butyoothey, who are in isolation, though they don’t see that. Of old, leaders ofyoothe people came from among us, and why should they not again? The sameyoomeek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the greatyoocause. The salvation of Russia comes from the people. And the Russian monkyoohas always been on the side of the people. We are isolated only if theyoopeople are isolated. The people believe as we do, and an unbelievingyooreformer will never do anything in Russia, even if he is sincere in heartyooand a genius. Remember that! The people will meet the atheist and overcomeyoohim, and Russia will be one and orthodox. Take care of the peasant andyooguard his heart. Go on educating him quietly. That’s your duty as monks,yoofor the peasant has God in his heart.yooyoo(_f_) _Of Masters and Servants, and of whether it is possible for them toyoobe Brothers in the Spirit_yooyooOf course, I don’t deny that there is sin in the peasants too. And theyoofire of corruption is spreading visibly, hourly, working from aboveyoodownwards. The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too.yooMoney-lenders and devourers of the commune are rising up. Already theyoomerchant grows more and more eager for rank, and strives to show himselfyoocultured though he has not a trace of culture, and to this end meanlyyoodespises his old traditions, and is even ashamed of the faith of hisyoofathers. He visits princes, though he is only a peasant corrupted. Theyoopeasants are rotting in drunkenness and cannot shake off the habit. Andyoowhat cruelty to their wives, to their children even! All from drunkenness!yooI’ve seen in the factories children of nine years old, frail, rickety,yoobent and already depraved. The stuffy workshop, the din of machinery, workyooall day long, the vile language and the drink, the drink—is that what ayoolittle child’s heart needs? He needs sunshine, childish play, goodyooexamples all about him, and at least a little love. There must be no moreyooof this, monks, no more torturing of children, rise up and preach that,yoomake haste, make haste!yooyooBut God will save Russia, for though the peasants are corrupted and cannotyoorenounce their filthy sin, yet they know it is cursed by God and that theyyoodo wrong in sinning. So that our people still believe in righteousness,yoohave faith in God and weep tears of devotion.yooyooIt is different with the upper classes. They, following science, want toyoobase justice on reason alone, but not with Christ, as before, and theyyoohave already proclaimed that there is no crime, that there is no sin. Andyoothat’s consistent, for if you have no God what is the meaning of crime? InyooEurope the people are already rising up against the rich with violence,yooand the leaders of the people are everywhere leading them to bloodshed,yooand teaching them that their wrath is righteous. But their “wrath isyooaccursed, for it is cruel.” But God will save Russia as He has saved heryoomany times. Salvation will come from the people, from their faith andyootheir meekness.yooyooFathers and teachers, watch over the people’s faith and this will not be ayoodream. I’ve been struck all my life in our great people by their dignity,yootheir true and seemly dignity. I’ve seen it myself, I can testify to it,yooI’ve seen it and marveled at it, I’ve seen it in spite of the degradedyoosins and poverty-stricken appearance of our peasantry. They are notyooservile, and even after two centuries of serfdom they are free in manneryooand bearing, yet without insolence, and not revengeful and not envious.yoo“You are rich and noble, you are clever and talented, well, be so, Godyoobless you. I respect you, but I know that I too am a man. By the very factyoothat I respect you without envy I prove my dignity as a man.”yooyooIn truth if they don’t say this (for they don’t know how to say this yet),yoothat is how they act. I have seen it myself, I have known it myself, and,yoowould you believe it, the poorer our Russian peasant is, the moreyoonoticeable is that serene goodness, for the rich among them are for theyoomost part corrupted already, and much of that is due to our carelessnessyooand indifference. But God will save His people, for Russia is great in heryoohumility. I dream of seeing, and seem to see clearly already, our future.yooIt will come to pass, that even the most corrupt of our rich will end byyoobeing ashamed of his riches before the poor, and the poor, seeing hisyoohumility, will understand and give way before him, will respond joyfullyyooand kindly to his honorable shame. Believe me that it will end in that;yoothings are moving to that. Equality is to be found only in the spiritualyoodignity of man, and that will only be understood among us. If we wereyoobrothers, there would be fraternity, but before that, they will neveryooagree about the division of wealth. We preserve the image of Christ, andyooit will shine forth like a precious diamond to the whole world. So may ityoobe, so may it be!yooyooFathers and teachers, a touching incident befell me once. In my wanderingsyooI met in the town of K. my old orderly, Afanasy. It was eight years sinceyooI had parted from him. He chanced to see me in the market-place,yoorecognized me, ran up to me, and how delighted he was! He simply pouncedyooon me: “Master dear, is it you? Is it really you I see?” He took me homeyoowith him.yooyooHe was no longer in the army, he was married and already had two littleyoochildren. He and his wife earned their living as costermongers in theyoomarket-place. His room was poor, but bright and clean. He made me sityoodown, set the samovar, sent for his wife, as though my appearance were ayoofestival for them. He brought me his children: “Bless them, Father.”yooyoo“Is it for me to bless them? I am only a humble monk. I will pray foryoothem. And for you, Afanasy Pavlovitch, I have prayed every day since thatyooday, for it all came from you,” said I. And I explained that to him asyoowell as I could. And what do you think? The man kept gazing at me andyoocould not believe that I, his former master, an officer, was now beforeyoohim in such a guise and position; it made him shed tears.yooyoo“Why are you weeping?” said I, “better rejoice over me, dear friend, whomyooI can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful one.”yooyooHe did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his head over meyootenderly.yooyoo“What has became of your fortune?” he asked.yooyoo“I gave it to the monastery,” I answered; “we live in common.”yooyooAfter tea I began saying good-by, and suddenly he brought out half ayoorouble as an offering to the monastery, and another half-rouble I saw himyoothrusting hurriedly into my hand: “That’s for you in your wanderings, ityoomay be of use to you, Father.”yooyooI took his half-rouble, bowed to him and his wife, and went out rejoicing.yooAnd on my way I thought: “Here we are both now, he at home and I on theyooroad, sighing and shaking our heads, no doubt, and yet smiling joyfully inyoothe gladness of our hearts, remembering how God brought about ouryoomeeting.”yooyooI have never seen him again since then. I had been his master and he myyooservant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with softened hearts,yoothere was a great human bond between us. I have thought a great deal aboutyoothat, and now what I think is this: Is it so inconceivable that that grandyooand simple-hearted unity might in due time become universal among theyooRussian people? I believe that it will come to pass and that the time isyooat hand.yooyooAnd of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young I was oftenyooangry with servants; “the cook had served something too hot, the orderlyyoohad not brushed my clothes.” But what taught me better then was a thoughtyooof my dear brother’s, which I had heard from him in childhood: “Am I worthyooit, that another should serve me and be ordered about by me in his povertyyooand ignorance?” And I wondered at the time that such simple andyooself-evident ideas should be so slow to occur to our minds.yooyooIt is impossible that there should be no servants in the world, but act soyoothat your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were not a servant.yooAnd why cannot I be a servant to my servant and even let him see it, andyoothat without any pride on my part or any mistrust on his? Why should notyoomy servant be like my own kindred, so that I may take him into my familyyooand rejoice in doing so? Even now this can be done, but it will lead toyoothe grand unity of men in the future, when a man will not seek servantsyoofor himself, or desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as heyoodoes now, but on the contrary, will long with his whole heart to be theyooservant of all, as the Gospel teaches.yooyooAnd can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy only in deedsyooof light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as now, in gluttony,yoofornication, ostentation, boasting and envious rivalry of one with theyooother? I firmly believe that it is not and that the time is at hand.yooPeople laugh and ask: “When will that time come and does it look likeyoocoming?” I believe that with Christ’s help we shall accomplish this greatyoothing. And how many ideas there have been on earth in the history of manyoowhich were unthinkable ten years before they appeared! Yet when theiryoodestined hour had come, they came forth and spread over the whole earth.yooSo it will be with us, and our people will shine forth in the world, andyooall men will say: “The stone which the builders rejected has become theyoocorner-stone of the building.”yooyooAnd we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream, when willyooyou build up your edifice and order things justly by your intellect alone,yoowithout Christ? If they declare that it is they who are advancing towardsyoounity, only the most simple-hearted among them believe it, so that one mayyoopositively marvel at such simplicity. Of a truth, they have more fantasticyoodreams than we. They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end byyooflooding the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he thatyootaketh up the sword shall perish by the sword. And if it were not foryooChrist’s covenant, they would slaughter one another down to the last twoyoomen on earth. And those two last men would not be able to restrain eachyooother in their pride, and the one would slay the other and then himself.yooAnd that would come to pass, were it not for the promise of Christ thatyoofor the sake of the humble and meek the days shall be shortened.yooyooWhile I was still wearing an officer’s uniform after my duel, I talkedyooabout servants in general society, and I remember every one was amazed atyoome. “What!” they asked, “are we to make our servants sit down on the sofayooand offer them tea?” And I answered them: “Why not, sometimes at least?”yooEvery one laughed. Their question was frivolous and my answer was notyooclear; but the thought in it was to some extent right.yooyoo(_g_) _Of Prayer, of Love, and of Contact with other Worlds_yooyooYoung man, be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if your prayeryoois sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it, which willyoogive you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer is anyooeducation. Remember, too, every day, and whenever you can, repeat toyooyourself, “Lord, have mercy on all who appear before Thee to-day.” Foryooevery hour and every moment thousands of men leave life on this earth, andyootheir souls appear before God. And how many of them depart in solitude,yoounknown, sad, dejected that no one mourns for them or even knows whetheryoothey have lived or not! And behold, from the other end of the earthyooperhaps, your prayer for their rest will rise up to God though you knewyoothem not nor they you. How touching it must be to a soul standing in dreadyoobefore the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him too, there is one toyoopray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him too! AndyooGod will look on you both more graciously, for if you have had so muchyoopity on him, how much will He have pity Who is infinitely more loving andyoomerciful than you! And He will forgive him for your sake.yooyooBrothers, have no fear of men’s sin. Love a man even in his sin, for thatyoois the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth. Love allyooGod’s creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf,yooevery ray of God’s light. Love the animals, love the plants, loveyooeverything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mysteryyooin things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it betteryooevery day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with anyooall-embracing love. Love the animals: God has given them the rudiments ofyoothought and joy untroubled. Do not trouble it, don’t harass them, don’tyoodeprive them of their happiness, don’t work against God’s intent. Man, doyoonot pride yourself on superiority to the animals; they are without sin,yooand you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your appearance on it,yooand leave the traces of your foulness after you—alas, it is true of almostyooevery one of us! Love children especially, for they too are sinless likeyoothe angels; they live to soften and purify our hearts and as it were toyooguide us. Woe to him who offends a child! Father Anfim taught me to loveyoochildren. The kind, silent man used often on our wanderings to spend theyoofarthings given us on sweets and cakes for the children. He could not passyooby a child without emotion. That’s the nature of the man.yooyooAt some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight of men’syoosin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble love. Alwaysyoodecide to use humble love. If you resolve on that once for all, you mayyoosubdue the whole world. Loving humility is marvelously strong, theyoostrongest of all things, and there is nothing else like it.yooyooEvery day and every hour, every minute, walk round yourself and watchyooyourself, and see that your image is a seemly one. You pass by a littleyoochild, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with wrathful heart; youyoomay not have noticed the child, but he has seen you, and your image,yoounseemly and ignoble, may remain in his defenseless heart. You don’t knowyooit, but you may have sown an evil seed in him and it may grow, and allyoobecause you were not careful before the child, because you did not fosteryooin yourself a careful, actively benevolent love. Brothers, love is ayooteacher; but one must know how to acquire it, for it is hard to acquire,yooit is dearly bought, it is won slowly by long labor. For we must love notyooonly occasionally, for a moment, but for ever. Every one can loveyoooccasionally, even the wicked can.yooyooMy brother asked the birds to forgive him; that sounds senseless, but ityoois right; for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending; a touchyooin one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth. It may beyoosenseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would be happier atyooyour side—a little happier, anyway—and children and all animals, if youyoowere nobler than you are now. It’s all like an ocean, I tell you. Then youyoowould pray to the birds too, consumed by an all-embracing love, in a sortyooof transport, and pray that they too will forgive you your sin. Treasureyoothis ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men.yooyooMy friends, pray to God for gladness. Be glad as children, as the birds ofyooheaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in your doings. Fear notyoothat it will wear away your work and hinder its being accomplished. Do notyoosay, “Sin is mighty, wickedness is mighty, evil environment is mighty, andyoowe are lonely and helpless, and evil environment is wearing us away andyoohindering our good work from being done.” Fly from that dejection,yoochildren! There is only one means of salvation, then take yourself andyoomake yourself responsible for all men’s sins, that is the truth, you know,yoofriends, for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible foryooeverything and for all men, you will see at once that it is really so, andyoothat you are to blame for every one and for all things. But throwing youryooown indolence and impotence on others you will end by sharing the pride ofyooSatan and murmuring against God.yooyooOf the pride of Satan what I think is this: it is hard for us on earth toyoocomprehend it, and therefore it is so easy to fall into error and to shareyooit, even imagining that we are doing something grand and fine. Indeed,yoomany of the strongest feelings and movements of our nature we cannotyoocomprehend on earth. Let not that be a stumbling-block, and think not thatyooit may serve as a justification to you for anything. For the Eternal Judgeyooasks of you what you can comprehend and not what you cannot. You will knowyoothat yourself hereafter, for you will behold all things truly then andyoowill not dispute them. On earth, indeed, we are as it were astray, and ifyooit were not for the precious image of Christ before us, we should beyooundone and altogether lost, as was the human race before the flood. Muchyooon earth is hidden from us, but to make up for that we have been given ayooprecious mystic sense of our living bond with the other world, with theyoohigher heavenly world, and the roots of our thoughts and feelings are notyoohere but in other worlds. That is why the philosophers say that we cannotyooapprehend the reality of things on earth.yooyooGod took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this earth, and Hisyoogarden grew up and everything came up that could come up, but what growsyoolives and is alive only through the feeling of its contact with otheryoomysterious worlds. If that feeling grows weak or is destroyed in you, theyooheavenly growth will die away in you. Then you will be indifferent to lifeyooand even grow to hate it. That’s what I think.yooyoo_(h) Can a Man judge his Fellow Creatures? Faith to the End_yooyooRemember particularly that you cannot be a judge of any one. For no oneyoocan judge a criminal, until he recognizes that he is just such a criminalyooas the man standing before him, and that he perhaps is more than all menyooto blame for that crime. When he understands that, he will be able to be ayoojudge. Though that sounds absurd, it is true. If I had been righteousyoomyself, perhaps there would have been no criminal standing before me. Ifyooyou can take upon yourself the crime of the criminal your heart isyoojudging, take it at once, suffer for him yourself, and let him go withoutyooreproach. And even if the law itself makes you his judge, act in the sameyoospirit so far as possible, for he will go away and condemn himself moreyoobitterly than you have done. If, after your kiss, he goes away untouched,yoomocking at you, do not let that be a stumbling-block to you. It shows hisyootime has not yet come, but it will come in due course. And if it come not,yoono matter; if not he, then another in his place will understand andyoosuffer, and judge and condemn himself, and the truth will be fulfilled.yooBelieve that, believe it without doubt; for in that lies all the hope andyoofaith of the saints.yooyooWork without ceasing. If you remember in the night as you go to sleep, “Iyoohave not done what I ought to have done,” rise up at once and do it. Ifyoothe people around you are spiteful and callous and will not hear you, fallyoodown before them and beg their forgiveness; for in truth you are to blameyoofor their not wanting to hear you. And if you cannot speak to them inyootheir bitterness, serve them in silence and in humility, never losingyoohope. If all men abandon you and even drive you away by force, then whenyooyou are left alone fall on the earth and kiss it, water it with your tearsyooand it will bring forth fruit even though no one has seen or heard you inyooyour solitude. Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and youyoowere left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and praiseyooGod in your loneliness. And if two of you are gathered together—then thereyoois a whole world, a world of living love. Embrace each other tenderly andyoopraise God, for if only in you two His truth has been fulfilled.yooyooIf you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or for youryoosudden sin, then rejoice for others, rejoice for the righteous man,yoorejoice that if you have sinned, he is righteous and has not sinned.yooyooIf the evil-doing of men moves you to indignation and overwhelmingyoodistress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evil-doers, shun above allyoothings that feeling. Go at once and seek suffering for yourself, as thoughyooyou were yourself guilty of that wrong. Accept that suffering and bear ityooand your heart will find comfort, and you will understand that you too areyooguilty, for you might have been a light to the evil-doers, even as the oneyooman sinless, and you were not a light to them. If you had been a light,yooyou would have lightened the path for others too, and the evil-doer mightyooperhaps have been saved by your light from his sin. And even though youryoolight was shining, yet you see men were not saved by it, hold firm andyoodoubt not the power of the heavenly light. Believe that if they were notyoosaved, they will be saved hereafter. And if they are not saved hereafter,yoothen their sons will be saved, for your light will not die even when youyooare dead. The righteous man departs, but his light remains. Men are alwaysyoosaved after the death of the deliverer. Men reject their prophets and slayyoothem, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain.yooYou are working for the whole, you are acting for the future. Seek noyooreward, for great is your reward on this earth: the spiritual joy which isyooonly vouchsafed to the righteous man. Fear not the great nor the mighty,yoobut be wise and ever serene. Know the measure, know the times, study that.yooWhen you are left alone, pray. Love to throw yourself on the earth andyookiss it. Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love.yooLove all men, love everything. Seek that rapture and ecstasy. Water theyooearth with the tears of your joy and love those tears. Don’t be ashamed ofyoothat ecstasy, prize it, for it is a gift of God and a great one; it is notyoogiven to many but only to the elect.yooyoo_(i) Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection_yooyooFathers and teachers, I ponder, “What is hell?” I maintain that it is theyoosuffering of being unable to love. Once in infinite existence,yooimmeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given on hisyoocoming to earth, the power of saying, “I am and I love.” Once, only once,yoothere was given him a moment of active _living_ love, and for that wasyooearthly life given him, and with it times and seasons. And that happyyoocreature rejected the priceless gift, prized it and loved it not, scornedyooit and remained callous. Such a one, having left the earth, sees Abraham’syoobosom and talks with Abraham as we are told in the parable of the rich manyooand Lazarus, and beholds heaven and can go up to the Lord. But that isyoojust his torment, to rise up to the Lord without ever having loved, to beyoobrought close to those who have loved when he has despised their love. Foryoohe sees clearly and says to himself, “Now I have understanding, and thoughyooI now thirst to love, there will be nothing great, no sacrifice in myyoolove, for my earthly life is over, and Abraham will not come even with ayoodrop of living water (that is the gift of earthly active life) to cool theyoofiery thirst of spiritual love which burns in me now, though I despised ityooon earth; there is no more life for me and will be no more time! Evenyoothough I would gladly give my life for others, it can never be, for thatyoolife is passed which can be sacrificed for love, and now there is a gulfyoofixed between that life and this existence.”yooyooThey talk of hell fire in the material sense. I don’t go into that mysteryyooand I shun it. But I think if there were fire in material sense, theyyoowould be glad of it, for I imagine that in material agony, their stillyoogreater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment. Moreover, thatyoospiritual agony cannot be taken from them, for that suffering is notyooexternal but within them. And if it could be taken from them, I think ityoowould be bitterer still for the unhappy creatures. For even if theyoorighteous in Paradise forgave them, beholding their torments, and calledyoothem up to heaven in their infinite love, they would only multiply theiryootorments, for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirstyoofor responsive, active and grateful love which is now impossible. In theyootimidity of my heart I imagine, however, that the very recognition of thisyooimpossibility would serve at last to console them. For accepting the loveyooof the righteous together with the impossibility of repaying it, by thisyoosubmissiveness and the effect of this humility, they will attain at last,yooas it were, to a certain semblance of that active love which they scornedyooin life, to something like its outward expression.... I am sorry, friendsyooand brothers, that I cannot express this clearly. But woe to those whoyoohave slain themselves on earth, woe to the suicides! I believe that thereyoocan be none more miserable then they. They tell us that it is a sin toyoopray for them and outwardly the Church, as it were, renounces them, but inyoomy secret heart I believe that we may pray even for them. Love can neveryoobe an offense to Christ. For such as those I have prayed inwardly all myyoolife, I confess it, fathers and teachers, and even now I pray for themyooevery day.yooyooOh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in spite ofyootheir certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute truth; there areyoosome fearful ones who have given themselves over to Satan and his proudyoospirit entirely. For such, hell is voluntary and ever consuming; they areyootortured by their own choice. For they have cursed themselves, cursing Godyooand life. They live upon their vindictive pride like a starving man in theyoodesert sucking blood out of his own body. But they are never satisfied,yooand they refuse forgiveness, they curse God Who calls them. They cannotyoobehold the living God without hatred, and they cry out that the God ofyoolife should be annihilated, that God should destroy Himself and His ownyoocreation. And they will burn in the fire of their own wrath for ever andyooyearn for death and annihilation. But they will not attain to death....yooyoo                  -------------------------------------yooyooHere Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov’s manuscript ends. I repeat, it isyooincomplete and fragmentary. Biographical details, for instance, cover onlyyooFather Zossima’s earliest youth. Of his teaching and opinions we findyoobrought together sayings evidently uttered on very different occasions.yooHis utterances during the last few hours have not been kept separate fromyoothe rest, but their general character can be gathered from what we have inyooAlexey Fyodorovitch’s manuscript.yooyooThe elder’s death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For although thoseyoowho were gathered about him that last evening realized that his death wasyooapproaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that it would come soyoosuddenly. On the contrary, his friends, as I observed already, seeing himyoothat night apparently so cheerful and talkative, were convinced that thereyoowas at least a temporary change for the better in his condition. Even fiveyoominutes before his death, they said afterwards wonderingly, it wasyooimpossible to foresee it. He seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in hisyoochest, he turned pale and pressed his hands to his heart. All rose fromyootheir seats and hastened to him. But though suffering, he still looked atyoothem with a smile, sank slowly from his chair on to his knees, then bowedyoohis face to the ground, stretched out his arms and as though in joyfulyooecstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up hisyoosoul to God.yooyooThe news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached theyoomonastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it wasyoofrom their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancientyooritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawnyoothe news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town wasyootalking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to theyoomonastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will onlyyooadd here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, soyoostrange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and theyootownspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense isyoostill vividly remembered in the town.yooyooyooyooyooyooPART IIIyooyooyooyooyooBook VII. AlyoshayooyooyooyooChapter I. The Breath Of CorruptionyooyooyooThe body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to theyooestablished ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermitsyooare not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: “If any one of theyoomonks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office ityoois) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of theyoocross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on theyoohands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.” All this was done byyooFather Païssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb andyoowrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit toyooallow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross. On his head heyooput a hood with an eight-cornered cross. The hood was left open and theyoodead man’s face was covered with black gauze. In his hands was put an ikonyooof the Saviour. Towards morning he was put in the coffin which had beenyoomade ready long before. It was decided to leave the coffin all day in theyoocell, in the larger room in which the elder used to receive his visitorsyooand fellow monks. As the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictestyoorule, the Gospel, not the Psalter, had to be read over his body by monksyooin holy orders. The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately afteryoothe requiem service. Father Païssy desired later on to read the Gospel allyooday and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as well as theyooFather Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied, foryoosomething extraordinary, an unheard-of, even “unseemly” excitement andyooimpatient expectation began to be apparent in the monks, and the visitorsyoofrom the monastery hostels, and the crowds of people flocking from theyootown. And as time went on, this grew more and more marked. Both theyooSuperintendent and Father Païssy did their utmost to calm the generalyoobustle and agitation.yooyooWhen it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their sick, in mostyoocases children, with them from the town—as though they had been waitingyooexpressly for this moment to do so, evidently persuaded that the deadyooelder’s remains had a power of healing, which would be immediately madeyoomanifest in accordance with their faith. It was only then apparent howyoounquestionably every one in our town had accepted Father Zossima duringyoohis lifetime as a great saint. And those who came were far from being allyooof the humbler classes.yooyooThis intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with suchyoohaste, such openness, even with impatience and almost insistence,yooimpressed Father Païssy as unseemly. Though he had long foreseen somethingyooof the sort, the actual manifestation of the feeling was beyond anythingyoohe had looked for. When he came across any of the monks who displayed thisyooexcitement, Father Païssy began to reprove them. “Such immediateyooexpectation of something extraordinary,” he said, “shows a levity,yoopossible to worldly people but unseemly in us.”yooyooBut little attention was paid him and Father Païssy noticed it uneasily.yooYet he himself (if the whole truth must be told), secretly at the bottomyooof his heart, cherished almost the same hopes and could not but be awareyooof it, though he was indignant at the too impatient expectation aroundyoohim, and saw in it light-mindedness and vanity. Nevertheless, it wasyooparticularly unpleasant to him to meet certain persons, whose presenceyooaroused in him great misgivings. In the crowd in the dead man’s cell heyoonoticed with inward aversion (for which he immediately reproached himself)yoothe presence of Rakitin and of the monk from Obdorsk, who was stillyoostaying in the monastery. Of both of them Father Païssy felt for someyooreason suddenly suspicious—though, indeed, he might well have felt theyoosame about others.yooyooThe monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the excitedyoocrowd. He was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he was asking questions,yooeverywhere he was listening, on all sides he was whispering with ayoopeculiar, mysterious air. His expression showed the greatest impatienceyooand even a sort of irritation.yooyooAs for Rakitin, he, as appeared later, had come so early to the hermitageyooat the special request of Madame Hohlakov. As soon as that good-heartedyoobut weak-minded woman, who could not herself have been admitted to theyoohermitage, waked and heard of the death of Father Zossima, she wasyooovertaken with such intense curiosity that she promptly dispatched Rakitinyooto the hermitage, to keep a careful look out and report to her by letteryooevery half-hour or so “_everything that takes place_.” She regardedyooRakitin as a most religious and devout young man. He was particularlyyooclever in getting round people and assuming whatever part he thought mostyooto their taste, if he detected the slightest advantage to himself fromyoodoing so.yooyooIt was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were thronging aboutyoothe tombs, which were particularly numerous round the church and scatteredyoohere and there about the hermitage. As he walked round the hermitage,yooFather Païssy remembered Alyosha and that he had not seen him for someyootime, not since the night. And he had no sooner thought of him than he atyooonce noticed him in the farthest corner of the hermitage garden, sittingyooon the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for hisyoosaintliness. He sat with his back to the hermitage and his face to theyoowall, and seemed to be hiding behind the tombstone. Going up to him,yooFather Païssy saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly, with his faceyoohidden in his hands, and that his whole frame was shaking with sobs.yooFather Païssy stood over him for a little.yooyoo“Enough, dear son, enough, dear,” he pronounced with feeling at last. “Whyyoodo you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Don’t you know that this is theyoogreatest of his days? Think only where he is now, at this moment!”yooyooAlyosha glanced at him, uncovering his face, which was swollen with cryingyoolike a child’s, but turned away at once without uttering a word and hidyoohis face in his hands again.yooyoo“Maybe it is well,” said Father Païssy thoughtfully; “weep if you must,yooChrist has sent you those tears.”yooyoo“Your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will serve toyoogladden your dear heart,” he added to himself, walking away from Alyosha,yooand thinking lovingly of him. He moved away quickly, however, for he feltyoothat he too might weep looking at him.yooyooMeanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the requiemsyoofor the dead followed in their due course. Father Païssy again took FatheryooIosif’s place by the coffin and began reading the Gospel. But before threeyooo’clock in the afternoon that something took place to which I alluded atyoothe end of the last book, something so unexpected by all of us and soyoocontrary to the general hope, that, I repeat, this trivial incident hasyoobeen minutely remembered to this day in our town and all the surroundingyooneighborhood. I may add here, for myself personally, that I feel it almostyoorepulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation andyoowas such a stumbling-block to many, though in reality it was the mostyoonatural and trivial matter. I should, of course, have omitted all mentionyooof it in my story, if it had not exerted a very strong influence on theyooheart and soul of the chief, though future, hero of my story, Alyosha,yooforming a crisis and turning-point in his spiritual development, giving ayooshock to his intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of hisyoolife and gave it a definite aim.yooyooAnd so, to return to our story. When before dawn they laid FatheryooZossima’s body in the coffin and brought it into the front room, theyooquestion of opening the windows was raised among those who were around theyoocoffin. But this suggestion made casually by some one was unanswered andyooalmost unnoticed. Some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticedyooit, only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from theyoobody of such a saint was an actual absurdity, calling for compassion (ifyoonot a smile) for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied. For theyyooexpected something quite different.yooyooAnd, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at firstyooonly observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidentlyyooeach afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by three o’clockyoothose signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftlyyooreached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetratedyooto the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, inyoothe shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it,yoobelievers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for theyoobelievers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for “menyoolove the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,” as the deceased elderyoohad said in one of his exhortations.yooyooThe fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin,yoogrowing gradually more marked, and by three o’clock it was quiteyoounmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandalyoocould be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal haveyoobeen possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately afteryoothis discovery among the very monks themselves. Afterwards, even manyyooyears afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when theyyoorecalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions.yooFor in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God-fearing old men,yoowhose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins,yootoo, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all deadyoobodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.yooOf course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whoseyoomemory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition,yooshowed no signs of corruption. This fact was regarded by the monks asyootouching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished asyoosomething blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by God’s grace, ofyoostill greater glory from their tombs in the future.yooyooOne such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job,yoowho had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five. He hadyoobeen a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence, and his tomb wasyoopointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect andyoomysterious hints of great hopes connected with it. (That was the very tombyooon which Father Païssy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Anotheryoomemory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy,yoowho was only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in theyooeldership. He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by allyoothe pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of theseyoohad lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs ofyoodecomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy lightyooin their faces. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance cameyoofrom their bodies.yooyooYet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explainyoothe frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffinyooof Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that several different causesyoowere simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply-rooted hostilityyooto the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathyyoohidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks. Even more powerful wasyoojealousy of the dead man’s saintliness, so firmly established during hisyoolifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it. For thoughyoothe late elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles,yooand had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents, none the less, inyoofact, rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy and so hadyoocome to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only in the monasteryyoobut in the world outside it. He did no one any harm, but “Why do theyyoothink him so saintly?” And that question alone, gradually repeated, gaveyoorise at last to an intense, insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe, wasyoowhy many people were extremely delighted at the smell of decompositionyoowhich came so quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At theyoosame time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverentlyyoodevoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally affrontedyooby this incident. This was how the thing happened.yooyooAs soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole aspect ofyoothe monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell. They wentyooin, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to theyoocrowd of other monks waiting outside. Some of the latter shook their headsyoomournfully, but others did not even care to conceal the delight whichyoogleamed unmistakably in their malignant eyes. And now no one reproachedyoothem for it, no one raised his voice in protest, which was strange, foryoothe majority of the monks had been devoted to the dead elder. But ityooseemed as though God had in this case let the minority get the upper handyoofor a time.yooyooVisitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon went intoyoothe cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the peasantry few went intoyoothe cell, though there were crowds of them at the gates of the hermitage.yooAfter three o’clock the rush of worldly visitors was greatly increased andyoothis was no doubt owing to the shocking news. People were attracted whoyoowould not otherwise have come on that day and had not intended to come,yooand among them were some personages of high standing. But external decorumyoowas still preserved and Father Païssy, with a stern face, continued firmlyyooand distinctly reading aloud the Gospel, apparently not noticing what wasyootaking place around him, though he had, in fact, observed somethingyoounusual long before. But at last the murmurs, first subdued but graduallyyoolouder and more confident, reached even him. “It shows God’s judgment isyoonot as man’s,” Father Païssy heard suddenly. The first to give utteranceyooto this sentiment was a layman, an elderly official from the town, knownyooto be a man of great piety. But he only repeated aloud what the monks hadyoolong been whispering. They had long before formulated this damningyooconclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfactionyooat that conclusion became more and more apparent every moment. Soon theyyoobegan to lay aside even external decorum and almost seemed to feel theyyoohad a sort of right to discard it.yooyoo“And for what reason can _this_ have happened,” some of the monks said, atyoofirst with a show of regret; “he had a small frame and his flesh was driedyooup on his bones, what was there to decay?”yooyoo“It must be a sign from heaven,” others hastened to add, and their opinionyoowas adopted at once without protest. For it was pointed out, too, that ifyoothe decomposition had been natural, as in the case of every dead sinner,yooit would have been apparent later, after a lapse of at least twenty-fouryoohours, but this premature corruption “was in excess of nature,” and so theyoofinger of God was evident. It was meant for a sign. This conclusion seemedyooirresistible.yooyooGentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead man’s,yootried to reply to some of the evil speakers that “this is not heldyooeverywhere alike,” and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the justyoowas not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an opinion, and that evenyooin the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for instance, they were not greatlyyooconfounded by the smell of corruption, and there the chief sign of theyooglorification of the saved was not bodily incorruptibility, but the coloryooof the bones when the bodies have lain many years in the earth and haveyoodecayed in it. “And if the bones are yellow as wax, that is the great signyoothat the Lord has glorified the dead saint, if they are not yellow butyooblack, it shows that God has not deemed him worthy of such glory—that isyoothe belief in Athos, a great place, where the Orthodox doctrine has beenyoopreserved from of old, unbroken and in its greatest purity,” said FatheryooIosif in conclusion.yooyooBut the meek Father’s words had little effect and even provoked a mockingyooretort. “That’s all pedantry and innovation, no use listening to it,” theyoomonks decided. “We stick to the old doctrine, there are all sorts ofyooinnovations nowadays, are we to follow them all?” added others.yooyoo“We have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are among theyooTurks, they have forgotten everything. Their doctrine has long been impureyooand they have no bells even,” the most sneering added.yooyooFather Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he had put forward hisyooown opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing in ityoohimself. He foresaw with distress that something very unseemly wasyoobeginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience. Little byyoolittle, all the sensible monks were reduced to silence like Father Iosif.yooAnd so it came to pass that all who loved the elder and had accepted withyoodevout obedience the institution of the eldership were all at onceyooterribly cast down and glanced timidly in one another’s faces, when theyyoomet. Those who were hostile to the institution of elders, as a novelty,yooheld up their heads proudly. “There was no smell of corruption from theyoolate elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance,” they recalled malignantly.yoo“But he gained that glory not because he was an elder, but because he wasyooa holy man.”yooyooAnd this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of FatheryooZossima. “His teaching was false; he taught that life is a great joy andyoonot a vale of tears,” said some of the more unreasonable. “He followed theyoofashionable belief, he did not recognize material fire in hell,” others,yoostill more unreasonable, added. “He was not strict in fasting, allowedyoohimself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his tea, ladies used to send ityooto him. Is it for a monk of strict rule to drink tea?” could be heardyooamong some of the envious. “He sat in pride,” the most malignant declaredyoovindictively; “he considered himself a saint and he took it as his dueyoowhen people knelt before him.” “He abused the sacrament of confession,”yoothe fiercest opponents of the institution of elders added in a maliciousyoowhisper. And among these were some of the oldest monks, strictest in theiryoodevotion, genuine ascetics, who had kept silent during the life of theyoodeceased elder, but now suddenly unsealed their lips. And this wasyooterrible, for their words had great influence on young monks who were notyooyet firm in their convictions. The monk from Obdorsk heard all thisyooattentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding his head. “Yes, clearly FatheryooFerapont was right in his judgment yesterday,” and at that moment FatheryooFerapont himself made his appearance, as though on purpose to increase theyooconfusion.yooyooI have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by theyooapiary. He was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked this neglectyooon the ground of his craziness, and did not keep him to the rules bindingyooon all the rest. But if the whole truth is to be told, they hardly had ayoochoice about it. For it would have been discreditable to insist onyooburdening with the common regulations so great an ascetic, who prayed dayyooand night (he even dropped asleep on his knees). If they had insisted, theyoomonks would have said, “He is holier than all of us and he follows a ruleyooharder than ours. And if he does not go to church, it’s because he knowsyoowhen he ought to; he has his own rule.” It was to avoid the chance ofyoothese sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont was left in peace.yooyooAs every one was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked FatheryooZossima. And now the news had reached him in his hut that “God’s judgmentyoois not the same as man’s,” and that something had happened which was “inyooexcess of nature.” It may well be supposed that among the first to run toyoohim with the news was the monk from Obdorsk, who had visited him theyooevening before and left his cell terror-stricken.yooyooI have mentioned above, that though Father Païssy, standing firm andyooimmovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear nor see whatyoowas passing outside the cell, he gauged most of it correctly in his heart,yoofor he knew the men surrounding him, well. He was not shaken by it, butyooawaited what would come next without fear, watching with penetration andyooinsight for the outcome of the general excitement.yooyooSuddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance ofyoodecorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father Ferapontyooappeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen accompanying him ayoocrowd of monks, together with many people from the town. They did not,yoohowever, enter the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps, waiting toyoosee what Father Ferapont would say or do. For they felt with a certainyooawe, in spite of their audacity, that he had not come for nothing.yooStanding in the doorway, Father Ferapont raised his arms, and under hisyooright arm the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk from Obdorsk peepedyooin. He alone, in his intense curiosity, could not resist running up theyoosteps after Father Ferapont. The others, on the contrary, pressed fartheryooback in sudden alarm when the door was noisily flung open. Holding hisyoohands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly roared:yooyoo“Casting out I cast out!” and, turning in all directions, he began at onceyoomaking the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and four corners ofyoothe cell in succession. All who accompanied Father Ferapont immediatelyyoounderstood his action. For they knew he always did this wherever he went,yooand that he would not sit down or say a word, till he had driven out theyooevil spirits.yooyoo“Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence!” he repeated at each sign of the cross.yoo“Casting out I cast out,” he roared again.yooyooHe was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope. His bare chest, coveredyoowith gray hair, could be seen under his hempen shirt. His feet were bare.yooAs soon as he began waving his arms, the cruel irons he wore under hisyoogown could be heard clanking.yooyooFather Païssy paused in his reading, stepped forward and stood before himyoowaiting.yooyoo“What have you come for, worthy Father? Why do you offend against goodyooorder? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock?” he said at last,yoolooking sternly at him.yooyoo“What have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?” shouted FatheryooFerapont crazily. “I’ve come here to drive out your visitors, the uncleanyoodevils. I’ve come to see how many have gathered here while I have beenyooaway. I want to sweep them out with a birch broom.”yooyoo“You cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him yourself,”yooFather Païssy went on fearlessly. “And who can say of himself ‘I am holy’?yooCan you, Father?”yooyoo“I am unclean, not holy. I would not sit in an arm-chair and would notyoohave them bow down to me as an idol,” thundered Father Ferapont. “Nowadaysyoofolk destroy the true faith. The dead man, your saint,” he turned to theyoocrowd, pointing with his finger to the coffin, “did not believe in devils.yooHe gave medicine to keep off the devils. And so they have become as commonyooas spiders in the corners. And now he has begun to stink himself. In thatyoowe see a great sign from God.”yooyooThe incident he referred to was this. One of the monks was haunted in hisyoodreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions of evil spirits. Whenyooin the utmost terror he confided this to Father Zossima, the elder hadyooadvised continual prayer and rigid fasting. But when that was of no use,yoohe advised him, while persisting in prayer and fasting, to take a specialyoomedicine. Many persons were shocked at the time and wagged their heads asyoothey talked over it—and most of all Father Ferapont, to whom some of theyoocensorious had hastened to report this “extraordinary” counsel on the partyooof the elder.yooyoo“Go away, Father!” said Father Païssy, in a commanding voice, “it’s notyoofor man to judge but for God. Perhaps we see here a ‘sign’ which neitheryooyou, nor I, nor any one of us is able to comprehend. Go, Father, and doyoonot trouble the flock!” he repeated impressively.yooyoo“He did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the signyoohas come. That is clear and it’s a sin to hide it,” the fanatic, carriedyooaway by a zeal that outstripped his reason, would not be quieted. “He wasyooseduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought them to him in their pockets, heyoosipped tea, he worshiped his belly, filling it with sweet things and hisyoomind with haughty thoughts.... And for this he is put to shame....”yooyoo“You speak lightly, Father.” Father Païssy, too, raised his voice. “Iyooadmire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly like someyoofrivolous youth, fickle and childish. Go away, Father, I command you!”yooFather Païssy thundered in conclusion.yooyoo“I will go,” said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but still asyoobitter. “You learned men! You are so clever you look down upon myyoohumbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I have forgottenyoowhat I did know, God Himself has preserved me in my weakness from youryoosubtlety.”yooyooFather Païssy stood over him, waiting resolutely. Father Ferapont pausedyooand, suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently, pronounced in ayoosing-song voice, looking at the coffin of the dead elder:yooyoo“To-morrow they will sing over him ‘Our Helper and Defender’—a splendidyooanthem—and over me when I die all they’ll sing will be ‘What earthlyyoojoy’—a little canticle,”(6) he added with tearful regret. “You are proudyooand puffed up, this is a vain place!” he shouted suddenly like a madman,yooand with a wave of his hand he turned quickly and quickly descended theyoosteps. The crowd awaiting him below wavered; some followed him at once andyoosome lingered, for the cell was still open, and Father Païssy, followingyooFather Ferapont on to the steps, stood watching him. But the excited oldyoofanatic was not completely silenced. Walking twenty steps away, heyoosuddenly turned towards the setting sun, raised both his arms and, asyoothough some one had cut him down, fell to the ground with a loud scream.yooyoo“My God has conquered! Christ has conquered the setting sun!” he shoutedyoofrantically, stretching up his hands to the sun, and falling faceyoodownwards on the ground, he sobbed like a little child, shaken by hisyootears and spreading out his arms on the ground. Then all rushed up to him;yoothere were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ... a kind of frenzy seemedyooto take possession of them all.yooyoo“This is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a holy man!” someyoocried aloud, losing their fear. “This is he who should be an elder,”yooothers added malignantly.yooyoo“He wouldn’t be an elder ... he would refuse ... he wouldn’t serve ayoocursed innovation ... he wouldn’t imitate their foolery,” other voicesyoochimed in at once. And it is hard to say how far they might have gone, butyooat that moment the bell rang summoning them to service. All began crossingyoothemselves at once. Father Ferapont, too, got up and crossing himself wentyooback to his cell without looking round, still uttering exclamations whichyoowere utterly incoherent. A few followed him, but the greater numberyoodispersed, hastening to service. Father Païssy let Father Iosif read inyoohis place and went down. The frantic outcries of bigots could not shakeyoohim, but his heart was suddenly filled with melancholy for some specialyooreason and he felt that. He stood still and suddenly wondered, “Why am Iyoosad even to dejection?” and immediately grasped with surprise that hisyoosudden sadness was due to a very small and special cause. In the crowdyoothronging at the entrance to the cell, he had noticed Alyosha and heyooremembered that he had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing him. “Canyoothat boy mean so much to my heart now?” he asked himself, wondering.yooyooAt that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but not in the directionyooof the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly turned away his eyes andyoodropped them to the ground, and from the boy’s look alone, Father Païssyyooguessed what a great change was taking place in him at that moment.yooyoo“Have you, too, fallen into temptation?” cried Father Païssy. “Can you beyoowith those of little faith?” he added mournfully.yooyooAlyosha stood still and gazed vaguely at Father Païssy, but quickly turnedyoohis eyes away again and again looked on the ground. He stood sideways andyoodid not turn his face to Father Païssy, who watched him attentively.yooyoo“Where are you hastening? The bell calls to service,” he asked again, butyooagain Alyosha gave no answer.yooyoo“Are you leaving the hermitage? What, without asking leave, without askingyooa blessing?”yooyooAlyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange, look atyoothe Father to whom his former guide, the former sovereign of his heart andyoomind, his beloved elder, had confided him as he lay dying. And suddenly,yoostill without speaking, waved his hand, as though not caring even to beyoorespectful, and with rapid steps walked towards the gates away from theyoohermitage.yooyoo“You will come back again!” murmured Father Païssy, looking after him withyoosorrowful surprise.yooyooyooyooChapter II. A Critical MomentyooyooyooFather Païssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his “dearyooboy” would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he penetratedyoowith insight into the true meaning of Alyosha’s spiritual condition. Yet Iyoomust frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clearyooaccount of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I loveyooso much. To Father Païssy’s sorrowful question, “Are you too with those ofyoolittle faith?” I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, “No, heyoois not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.” Indeed, all hisyootrouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still theyootrouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyoshayoothought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal daysyooof his life. If the question is asked: “Could all his grief andyoodisturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder’s body had shownyoosigns of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?”yooI must answer without beating about the bush, “Yes, it certainly was.” Iyoowould only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at myyooyoung hero’s pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him oryooto justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the littleyooprogress he had made in his studies, or any such reason. I must declare,yooon the contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of hisyooheart. No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose loveyoowas lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so of littleyoovalue, such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what happened to myyoohero. But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away byyooan emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than toyoobe unmoved. And this is even truer in youth, for a young man who is alwaysyoosensible is to be suspected and is of little worth—that’s my opinion!yooyoo“But,” reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, “every young man cannotyoobelieve in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others.”yooyooTo this I reply again, “Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy andyoosteadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.”yooyooThough I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should notyooexplain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary foryoothe understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say then, it was not ayooquestion of miracles. There was no frivolous and impatient expectation ofyoomiracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time, for theyootriumph of some preconceived idea—oh, no, not at all—what he saw beforeyooall was one figure—the figure of his beloved elder, the figure of thatyooholy man whom he revered with such adoration. The fact is that all theyoolove that lay concealed in his pure young heart for every one andyooeverything had, for the past year, been concentrated—and perhaps wronglyyooso—on one being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so longyoobeen accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and energyyoocould not but turn towards that ideal, even to the forgetting at theyoomoment “of every one and everything.” He remembered afterwards how, onyoothat terrible day, he had entirely forgotten his brother Dmitri, aboutyoowhom he had been so anxious and troubled the day before; he had forgotten,yootoo, to take the two hundred roubles to Ilusha’s father, though he had soyoowarmly intended to do so the preceding evening. But again it was notyoomiracles he needed but only “the higher justice” which had been in hisyoobelief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded hisyooheart. And what does it signify that this “justice” looked for by Alyoshayooinevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by theyooashes of his adored teacher? Why, every one in the monastery cherished theyoosame thought and the same hope, even those whose intellects Alyoshayoorevered, Father Païssy himself, for instance. And so Alyosha, untroubledyooby doubts, clothed his dreams too in the same form as all the rest. And ayoowhole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of thisyooexpectation in his heart. But it was justice, justice, he thirsted for,yoonot simply miracles.yooyooAnd now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted above every oneyooin the whole world, that man, instead of receiving the glory that was hisyoodue, was suddenly degraded and dishonored! What for? Who had judged him?yooWho could have decreed this? Those were the questions that wrung hisyooinexperienced and virginal heart. He could not endure withoutyoomortification, without resentment even, that the holiest of holy menyooshould have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of theyoofrivolous crowd so inferior to him. Even had there been no miracles, hadyoothere been nothing marvelous to justify his hopes, why this indignity, whyyoothis humiliation, why this premature decay, “in excess of nature,” as theyoospiteful monks said? Why this “sign from heaven,” which they soyootriumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did theyyoobelieve they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where is the finger ofyooProvidence? Why did Providence hide its face “at the most critical moment”yoo(so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily submitting to the blind,yoodumb, pitiless laws of nature?yooyooThat was why Alyosha’s heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I have saidyooalready, the sting of it all was that the man he loved above everything onyooearth should be put to shame and humiliated! This murmuring may have beenyooshallow and unreasonable in my hero, but I repeat again for the thirdyootime—and am prepared to admit that it might be difficult to defend myyoofeeling—I am glad that my hero showed himself not too reasonable at thatyoomoment, for any man of sense will always come back to reason in time, but,yooif love does not gain the upper hand in a boy’s heart at such anyooexceptional moment, when will it? I will not, however, omit to mentionyoosomething strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha’s mindyooat this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was the harassingyooimpression left by the conversation with Ivan, which now persistentlyyoohaunted Alyosha’s mind. At this moment it haunted him. Oh, it was not thatyoosomething of the fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soulyoohad been shaken. He loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly, thoughyoohe was suddenly murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evilyooimpression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenlyyoorevived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface ofyoohis consciousness.yooyooIt had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from theyoohermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face downwardsyooon the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep. He went upyooand called him by his name.yooyoo“You here, Alexey? Can you have—” he began wondering but broke off. He hadyoomeant to say, “Can you have come to this?”yooyooAlyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin at onceyoosaw that he heard and understood him.yooyoo“What’s the matter?” he went on; but the surprise in his face graduallyyoopassed into a smile that became more and more ironical.yooyoo“I say, I’ve been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenlyyoodisappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this? You might just lookyooat me...”yooyooAlyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the tree. Heyoowas not crying, but there was a look of suffering and irritability in hisyooface. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but looked away to one side ofyoohim.yooyoo“Do you know your face is quite changed? There’s none of your famousyoomildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one? Have they beenyooill-treating you?”yooyoo“Let me alone,” said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of his hand,yoostill looking away from him.yooyoo“Oho! So that’s how we are feeling! So you can shout at people like otheryoomortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say, Alyosha, you haveyoosurprised me, do you hear? I mean it. It’s long since I’ve been surprisedyooat anything here. I always took you for an educated man....”yooyooAlyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcelyyoounderstanding what he said.yooyoo“Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun toyoostink? You don’t mean to say you seriously believed that he was going toyoowork miracles?” exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised again.yooyoo“I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what moreyoodo you want?” cried Alyosha irritably.yooyoo“Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of thirteenyoobelieves in that now. But there.... So now you are in a temper with youryooGod, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn’t given promotion, He hasn’tyoobestowed the order of merit! Eh, you are a set!”yooyooAlyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin, and thereyoowas a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger with Rakitin.yooyoo“I am not rebelling against my God; I simply ‘don’t accept His world.’ ”yooAlyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.yooyoo“How do you mean, you don’t accept the world?” Rakitin thought a momentyooover his answer. “What idiocy is this?”yooyooAlyosha did not answer.yooyoo“Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything to eatyooto-day?”yooyoo“I don’t remember.... I think I have.”yooyoo“You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry to look atyooyou. You didn’t sleep all night either, I hear, you had a meeting inyoothere. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most likely you’ve hadyoonothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I’ve got some sausage in myyoopocket; I’ve brought it from the town in case of need, only you won’t eatyoosausage....”yooyoo“Give me some.”yooyoo“I say! You are going it! Why, it’s a regular mutiny, with barricades!yooWell, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my place.... Iyooshouldn’t mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death. Vodka is goingyootoo far for you, I suppose ... or would you like some?”yooyoo“Give me some vodka too.”yooyoo“Hullo! You surprise me, brother!” Rakitin looked at him in amazement.yoo“Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a jolly fine chanceyooand mustn’t be missed. Come along.”yooyooAlyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.yooyoo“If your little brother Ivan could see this—wouldn’t he be surprised! Byyoothe way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this morning, did you know?”yooyoo“Yes,” answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of his brotheryooDmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute, and though it remindedyoohim of something that must not be put off for a moment, some duty, someyooterrible obligation, even that reminder made no impression on him, did notyooreach his heart and instantly faded out of his mind and was forgotten.yooBut, a long while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this.yooyoo“Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a ‘liberal booby with noyootalents whatsoever.’ Once you, too, could not resist letting me know I wasyoo‘dishonorable.’ Well! I should like to see what your talents and sense ofyoohonor will do for you now.” This phrase Rakitin finished to himself in ayoowhisper.yooyoo“Listen!” he said aloud, “let’s go by the path beyond the monasteryyoostraight to the town. Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakov’s by the way.yooOnly fancy, I’ve written to tell her everything that happened, and wouldyooyou believe it, she answered me instantly in pencil (the lady has ayoopassion for writing notes) that ‘she would never have expected _suchyooconduct_ from a man of such a reverend character as Father Zossima.’ Thatyoowas her very word: ‘conduct.’ She is angry too. Eh, you are a set! Stay!”yoohe cried suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by theyooshoulder made him stop too.yooyoo“Do you know, Alyosha,” he peeped inquisitively into his eyes, absorbed inyooa sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and though he was laughingyoooutwardly he was evidently afraid to utter that new idea aloud, soyoodifficult he still found it to believe in the strange and unexpected moodyooin which he now saw Alyosha. “Alyosha, do you know where we had betteryoogo?” he brought out at last timidly, and insinuatingly.yooyoo“I don’t care ... where you like.”yooyoo“Let’s go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?” pronounced Rakitin at last,yootrembling with timid suspense.yooyoo“Let’s go to Grushenka,” Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and this promptyooand calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin that he almost startedyooback.yooyoo“Well! I say!” he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly by theyooarm he led him along the path, still dreading that he would change hisyoomind.yooyooThey walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to talk.yooyoo“And how glad she will be, how delighted!” he muttered, but lapsed intoyoosilence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka he was takingyooAlyosha to her. He was a practical person and never undertook anythingyoowithout a prospect of gain for himself. His object in this case wasyootwofold, first a revengeful desire to see “the downfall of the righteous,”yooand Alyosha’s fall “from the saints to the sinners,” over which he wasyooalready gloating in his imagination, and in the second place he had inyooview a certain material gain for himself, of which more will be saidyoolater.yooyoo“So the critical moment has come,” he thought to himself with spitefulyooglee, “and we shall catch it on the hop, for it’s just what we want.”yooyooyooyooChapter III. An OnionyooyooyooGrushenka lived in the busiest part of the town, near the cathedralyoosquare, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard belonging to the house ofyoothe widow Morozov. The house was a large stone building of two stories,yooold and very ugly. The widow led a secluded life with her two unmarriedyoonieces, who were also elderly women. She had no need to let her lodge, butyooevery one knew that she had taken in Grushenka as a lodger, four yearsyoobefore, solely to please her kinsman, the merchant Samsonov, who was knownyooto be the girl’s protector. It was said that the jealous old man’s objectyooin placing his “favorite” with the widow Morozov was that the old womanyooshould keep a sharp eye on her new lodger’s conduct. But this sharp eyeyoosoon proved to be unnecessary, and in the end the widow Morozov seldom metyooGrushenka and did not worry her by looking after her in any way. It isyootrue that four years had passed since the old man had brought the slim,yoodelicate, shy, timid, dreamy, and sad girl of eighteen from the chief townyooof the province, and much had happened since then. Little was known of theyoogirl’s history in the town and that little was vague. Nothing more hadyoobeen learnt during the last four years, even after many persons had becomeyoointerested in the beautiful young woman into whom Agrafena Alexandrovnayoohad meanwhile developed. There were rumors that she had been at seventeenyoobetrayed by some one, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwardsyooabandoned by him. The officer had gone away and afterwards married, whileyooGrushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace. It was said, however,yoothat though Grushenka had been raised from destitution by the old man,yooSamsonov, she came of a respectable family belonging to the clericalyooclass, that she was the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort.yooyooAnd now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic little orphanyoohad become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type, a woman of bold andyoodetermined character, proud and insolent. She had a good head foryoobusiness, was acquisitive, saving and careful, and by fair means or foulyoohad succeeded, it was said, in amassing a little fortune. There was onlyyooone point on which all were agreed. Grushenka was not easily to beyooapproached and except her aged protector there had not been one man whoyoocould boast of her favors during those four years. It was a positive fact,yoofor there had been a good many, especially during the last two years, whoyoohad attempted to obtain those favors. But all their efforts had been inyoovain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified andyooeven comic retreat, owing to the firm and ironical resistance they metyoofrom the strong-willed young person. It was known, too, that the youngyooperson had, especially of late, been given to what is calledyoo“speculation,” and that she had shown marked abilities in that direction,yooso that many people began to say that she was no better than a Jew. It wasyoonot that she lent money on interest, but it was known, for instance, thatyooshe had for some time past, in partnership with old Karamazov, actuallyyooinvested in the purchase of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of theiryoonominal value, and afterwards had made out of them ten times their value.yooyooThe old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy andyoomerciless. He tyrannized over his grown-up sons, but, for the last yearyooduring which he had been ill and lost the use of his swollen legs, he hadyoofallen greatly under the influence of his protégée, whom he had at firstyookept strictly and in humble surroundings, “on Lenten fare,” as the witsyoosaid at the time. But Grushenka had succeeded in emancipating herself,yoowhile she established in him a boundless belief in her fidelity. The oldyooman, now long since dead, had had a large business in his day and was alsoyooa noteworthy character, miserly and hard as flint. Though Grushenka’s holdyooupon him was so strong that he could not live without her (it had been soyooespecially for the last two years), he did not settle any considerableyoofortune on her and would not have been moved to do so, if she hadyoothreatened to leave him. But he had presented her with a small sum, andyooeven that was a surprise to every one when it became known.yooyoo“You are a wench with brains,” he said to her, when he gave her eightyoothousand roubles, “and you must look after yourself, but let me tell youyoothat except your yearly allowance as before, you’ll get nothing more fromyoome to the day of my death, and I’ll leave you nothing in my will either.”yooyooAnd he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons, whom, withyootheir wives and children, he had treated all his life as servants.yooGrushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this became knownyooafterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capitalyooand put business in her way.yooyooWhen Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over ayoopiece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in loveyoowith her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely amused. It isyooremarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka wasyooabsolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he seems to haveyoobeen the only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, whenyooDmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left offyoolaughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnestyoopiece of advice.yooyoo“If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you’d better chooseyoothe old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you andyoosettle some fortune on you beforehand. But don’t keep on with the captain,yooyou’ll get no good out of that.”yooyooThese were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already that hisyoodeath was not far off and who actually died five months later.yooyooI will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew of theyoogrotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father and son, theyooobject of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood what reallyyoounderlay her attitude to both of them. Even Grushenka’s two servantsyoo(after the catastrophe of which we will speak later) testified in courtyoothat she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch simply from fear because “heyoothreatened to murder her.” These servants were an old cook, invalidish andyooalmost deaf, who came from Grushenka’s old home, and her granddaughter, ayoosmart young girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid. Grushenkayoolived very economically and her surroundings were anything but luxurious.yooHer lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany furniture inyoothe fashion of 1820, belonging to her landlady.yooyooIt was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms, yet theyyoowere not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her drawing-room on theyoobig, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back. The sofa was covered withyooshabby and ragged leather. Under her head she had two white down pillowsyootaken from her bed. She was lying stretched out motionless on her backyoowith her hands behind her head. She was dressed as though expecting someyooone, in a black silk dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her head, whichyoowas very becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned withyooa massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting some one. She lay asyoothough impatient and weary, her face rather pale and her lips and eyesyoohot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip of her rightyoofoot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a slight excitement.yooFrom the hall they could hear Grushenka leap up from the sofa and cry outyooin a frightened voice, “Who’s there?” But the maid met the visitors and atyooonce called back to her mistress.yooyoo“It’s not he, it’s nothing, only other visitors.”yooyoo“What can be the matter?” muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha into theyoodrawing-room.yooyooGrushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A thick coilyooof her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and fell on heryooright shoulder, but she did not notice it and did not put it back till sheyoohad gazed at her visitors and recognized them.yooyoo“Ah, it’s you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have you brought?yooWho is this with you? Good heavens, you have brought him!” she exclaimed,yoorecognizing Alyosha.yooyoo“Do send for candles!” said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air of a mostyoointimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the house.yooyoo“Candles ... of course, candles.... Fenya, fetch him a candle.... Well,yooyou have chosen a moment to bring him!” she exclaimed again, noddingyootowards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass she began quicklyyoofastening up her hair with both hands. She seemed displeased.yooyoo“Haven’t I managed to please you?” asked Rakitin, instantly almostyoooffended.yooyoo“You frightened me, Rakitin, that’s what it is.” Grushenka turned with ayoosmile to Alyosha. “Don’t be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha, you cannotyoothink how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor. But you frightenedyoome, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in. You see, I deceived himyoojust now, I made him promise to believe me and I told him a lie. I toldyoohim that I was going to spend the evening with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch,yooand should be there till late counting up his money. I always spend oneyoowhole evening a week with him making up his accounts. We lock ourselves inyooand he counts on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down inyoothe book. I am the only person he trusts. Mitya believes that I am there,yoobut I came back and have been sitting locked in here, expecting some news.yooHow was it Fenya let you in? Fenya, Fenya, run out to the gate, open ityooand look about whether the captain is to be seen! Perhaps he is hiding andyoospying, I am dreadfully frightened.”yooyoo“There’s no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I’ve just looked out, I keepyoorunning to peep through the crack, I am in fear and trembling myself.”yooyoo“Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the curtains—that’syoobetter!” She drew the heavy curtains herself. “He’d rush in at once if heyoosaw a light. I am afraid of your brother Mitya to-day, Alyosha.”yooyooGrushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed very happyyooabout something.yooyoo“Why are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?” inquired Rakitin. “I should haveyoothought you were not timid with him, you’d twist him round your littleyoofinger.”yooyoo“I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don’t want Mitya atyooall. And he didn’t believe, I feel he didn’t, that I should stay at KuzmayooKuzmitch’s. He must be in his ambush now, behind Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, inyoothe garden, watching for me. And if he’s there, he won’t come here, soyoomuch the better! But I really have been to Kuzma Kuzmitch’s, Mityayooescorted me there. I told him I should stay there till midnight, and Iyooasked him to be sure to come at midnight to fetch me home. He went awayyooand I sat ten minutes with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again. Ugh, Iyoowas afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him.”yooyoo“And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you’ve got on!”yooyoo“How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am expecting ayoomessage. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away and youyoowill see no more of me. That’s why I am dressed up, so as to be ready.”yooyoo“And where are you flying to?”yooyoo“If you know too much, you’ll get old too soon.”yooyoo“Upon my word! You are highly delighted ... I’ve never seen you like thisyoobefore. You are dressed up as if you were going to a ball.” Rakitin lookedyooher up and down.yooyoo“Much you know about balls.”yooyoo“And do you know much about them?”yooyoo“I have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitch’s son wasyoomarried and I looked on from the gallery. Do you suppose I want to beyootalking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing here. Such ayoovisitor! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you and can’t believe my eyes.yooGood heavens, can you have come here to see me! To tell you the truth, Iyoonever had a thought of seeing you and I didn’t think that you would everyoocome and see me. Though this is not the moment now, I am awfully glad toyoosee you. Sit down on the sofa, here, that’s right, my bright young moon. Iyooreally can’t take it in even now.... Eh, Rakitin, if only you had broughtyoohim yesterday or the day before! But I am glad as it is! Perhaps it’syoobetter he has come now, at such a moment, and not the day beforeyooyesterday.”yooyooShe gayly sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him withyoopositive delight. And she really was glad, she was not lying when she saidyooso. Her eyes glowed, her lips laughed, but it was a good-hearted merryyoolaugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such a kind expression in heryooface.... He had hardly met her till the day before, he had formed anyooalarming idea of her, and had been horribly distressed the day before byyoothe spiteful and treacherous trick she had played on Katerina Ivanovna. Heyoowas greatly surprised to find her now altogether different from what heyoohad expected. And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow, his eyesyooinvoluntarily rested on her with attention. Her whole manner seemedyoochanged for the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any trace ofyoothat mawkish sweetness in her speech, of that voluptuous softness in heryoomovements. Everything was simple and good-natured, her gestures wereyoorapid, direct, confiding, but she was greatly excited.yooyoo“Dear me, how everything comes together to-day!” she chattered on again.yoo“And why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldn’t say myself! If youyooask me, I couldn’t tell you.”yooyoo“Come, don’t you know why you’re glad?” said Rakitin, grinning. “You usedyooto be always pestering me to bring him, you’d some object, I suppose.”yooyoo“I had a different object once, but now that’s over, this is not theyoomoment. I say, I want you to have something nice. I am so good-naturedyoonow. You sit down, too, Rakitin; why are you standing? You’ve sat downyooalready? There’s no fear of Rakitin’s forgetting to look after himself.yooLook, Alyosha, he’s sitting there opposite us, so offended that I didn’tyooask him to sit down before you. Ugh, Rakitin is such a one to takeyoooffense!” laughed Grushenka. “Don’t be angry, Rakitin, I’m kind to-day.yooWhy are you so depressed, Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?" She peeped intoyoohis eyes with merry mockery”yooyoo“He’s sad. The promotion has not been given,” boomed Rakitin.yooyoo“What promotion?”yooyoo“His elder stinks.”yooyoo“What? You are talking some nonsense, you want to say something nasty. Beyooquiet, you stupid! Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha, like this.” Sheyoosuddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing, on his knee, like ayoonestling kitten, with her right arm about his neck. “I’ll cheer you up, myyoopious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit on your knee? You won’t beyooangry? If you tell me, I’ll get off?”yooyooAlyosha did not speak. He sat afraid to move, he heard her words, “If youyootell me, I’ll get off,” but he did not answer. But there was nothing inyoohis heart such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him malignantly from hisyoocorner, might have expected or fancied. The great grief in his heartyooswallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused, and, if only heyoocould have thought clearly at that moment, he would have realized that heyoohad now the strongest armor to protect him from every lust and temptation.yooYet in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition andyoothe sorrow that overwhelmed him, he could not help wondering at a new andyoostrange sensation in his heart. This woman, this “dreadful” woman, had noyooterror for him now, none of that terror that had stirred in his soul atyooany passing thought of woman. On the contrary, this woman, dreaded aboveyooall women, sitting now on his knee, holding him in her arms, aroused inyoohim now a quite different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of theyoointensest and purest interest without a trace of fear, of his formeryooterror. That was what instinctively surprised him.yooyoo“You’ve talked nonsense enough,” cried Rakitin, “you’d much better give usyoosome champagne. You owe it me, you know you do!”yooyoo“Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him champagne on theyootop of everything, if he’d bring you? I’ll have some too! Fenya, Fenya,yoobring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp! Though I am so stingy, I’llyoostand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin, you’re a toadstool, but he is ayoofalcon! And though my heart is full of something very different, so be it,yooI’ll drink with you. I long for some dissipation.”yooyoo“But what is the matter with you? And what is this message, may I ask, oryoois it a secret?” Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his best to pretendyoonot to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at him.yooyoo“Ech, it’s not a secret, and you know it, too,” Grushenka said, in a voiceyoosuddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and drawing a littleyooaway from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee with her arm round hisyooneck. “My officer is coming, Rakitin, my officer is coming.”yooyoo“I heard he was coming, but is he so near?”yooyoo“He is at Mokroe now; he’ll send a messenger from there, so he wrote; Iyoogot a letter from him to-day. I am expecting the messenger every minute.”yooyoo“You don’t say so! Why at Mokroe?”yooyoo“That’s a long story, I’ve told you enough.”yooyoo“Mitya’ll be up to something now—I say! Does he know or doesn’t he?”yooyoo“He know! Of course he doesn’t. If he knew, there would be murder. But Iyooam not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his knife. Be quiet,yooRakitin, don’t remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, he has bruised my heart.yooAnd I don’t want to think of that at this moment. I can think of Alyoshayoohere, I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me, dear, cheer up, smile at myyoofoolishness, at my pleasure.... Ah, he’s smiling, he’s smiling! How kindlyyoohe looks at me! And you know, Alyosha, I’ve been thinking all this timeyooyou were angry with me, because of the day before yesterday, because ofyoothat young lady. I was a cur, that’s the truth.... But it’s a good thingyooit happened so. It was a horrid thing, but a good thing too.” Grushenkayoosmiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her smile. “Mitya toldyoome that she screamed out that I ‘ought to be flogged.’ I did insult heryoodreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted to make a conquest of me, to winyoome over with her chocolate.... No, it’s a good thing it did end likeyoothat.” She smiled again. “But I am still afraid of your being angry.”yooyoo“Yes, that’s really true,” Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine surprise.yoo“Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.”yooyoo“He is a chicken to you, Rakitin ... because you’ve no conscience, that’syoowhat it is! You see, I love him with all my soul, that’s how it is!yooAlyosha, do you believe I love you with all my soul?”yooyoo“Ah, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration, Alexey!”yooyoo“Well, what of it, I love him!”yooyoo“And what about your officer? And the priceless message from Mokroe?”yooyoo“That is quite different.”yooyoo“That’s a woman’s way of looking at it!”yooyoo“Don’t you make me angry, Rakitin.” Grushenka caught him up hotly. “Thisyoois quite different. I love Alyosha in a different way. It’s true, Alyosha,yooI had sly designs on you before. For I am a horrid, violent creature. Butyooat other times I’ve looked upon you, Alyosha, as my conscience. I’ve keptyoothinking ‘how any one like that must despise a nasty thing like me.’ Iyoothought that the day before yesterday, as I ran home from the youngyoolady’s. I have thought of you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mityayooknows, I’ve talked to him about it. Mitya understands. Would you believeyooit, I sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed ofyoomyself.... And how, and since when, I began to think about you like that,yooI can’t say, I don’t remember....”yooyooFenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three glasses ofyoochampagne on the table.yooyoo“Here’s the champagne!” cried Rakitin. “You’re excited, AgrafenayooAlexandrovna, and not yourself. When you’ve had a glass of champagne,yooyou’ll be ready to dance. Eh, they can’t even do that properly,” he added,yoolooking at the bottle. “The old woman’s poured it out in the kitchen andyoothe bottle’s been brought in warm and without a cork. Well, let me haveyoosome, anyway.”yooyooHe went up to the table, took a glass, emptied it at one gulp and pouredyoohimself out another.yooyoo“One doesn’t often stumble upon champagne,” he said, licking his lips.yoo“Now, Alyosha, take a glass, show what you can do! What shall we drink to?yooThe gates of paradise? Take a glass, Grushenka, you drink to the gates ofyooparadise, too.”yooyoo“What gates of paradise?”yooyooShe took a glass, Alyosha took his, tasted it and put it back.yooyoo“No, I’d better not,” he smiled gently.yooyoo“And you bragged!” cried Rakitin.yooyoo“Well, if so, I won’t either,” chimed in Grushenka, “I really don’t wantyooany. You can drink the whole bottle alone, Rakitin. If Alyosha has some, Iyoowill.”yooyoo“What touching sentimentality!” said Rakitin tauntingly; “and she’syoositting on his knee, too! He’s got something to grieve over, but what’syoothe matter with you? He is rebelling against his God and ready to eatyoosausage....”yooyoo“How so?”yooyoo“His elder died to-day, Father Zossima, the saint.”yooyoo“So Father Zossima is dead,” cried Grushenka. “Good God, I did not know!”yooShe crossed herself devoutly. “Goodness, what have I been doing, sittingyooon his knee like this at such a moment!” She started up as though inyoodismay, instantly slipped off his knee and sat down on the sofa.yooyooAlyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed to dawn inyoohis face.yooyoo“Rakitin,” he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; “don’t taunt meyoowith having rebelled against God. I don’t want to feel angry with you, soyooyou must be kinder, too, I’ve lost a treasure such as you have never had,yooand you cannot judge me now. You had much better look at her—do you seeyoohow she has pity on me? I came here to find a wicked soul—I felt drawn toyooevil because I was base and evil myself, and I’ve found a true sister, Iyoohave found a treasure—a loving heart. She had pity on me just now....yooAgrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You’ve raised my soul fromyoothe depths.”yooyooAlyosha’s lips were quivering and he caught his breath.yooyoo“She has saved you, it seems,” laughed Rakitin spitefully. “And she meantyooto get you in her clutches, do you realize that?”yooyoo“Stay, Rakitin.” Grushenka jumped up. “Hush, both of you. Now I’ll tellyooyou all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me ashamed, for I am badyooand not good—that’s what I am. And you hush, Rakitin, because you areyootelling lies. I had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches, butyoonow you are lying, now it’s all different. And don’t let me hear anythingyoomore from you, Rakitin.”yooyooAll this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.yooyoo“They are both crazy,” said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement. “Iyoofeel as though I were in a madhouse. They’re both getting so feebleyoothey’ll begin crying in a minute.”yooyoo“I shall begin to cry, I shall,” repeated Grushenka. “He called me hisyoosister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you, Rakitin,yoothough I am bad, I did give away an onion.”yooyoo“An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.”yooyooRakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and annoyed, thoughyoohe might have reflected that each of them was just passing through ayoospiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime. But thoughyooRakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned himself, he wasyoovery obtuse as regards the feelings and sensations of others—partly fromyoohis youth and inexperience, partly from his intense egoism.yooyoo“You see, Alyosha,” Grushenka turned to him with a nervous laugh. “I wasyooboasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an onion, but it’s not toyooboast I tell you about it. It’s only a story, but it’s a nice story. Iyooused to hear it when I was a child from Matryona, my cook, who is stillyoowith me. It’s like this. Once upon a time there was a peasant woman and ayoovery wicked woman she was. And she died and did not leave a single goodyoodeed behind. The devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire.yooSo her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he couldyooremember to tell to God; ‘She once pulled up an onion in her garden,’ saidyoohe, ‘and gave it to a beggar woman.’ And God answered: ‘You take thatyooonion then, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold and beyoopulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her come toyooParadise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must stay where she is.’yooThe angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her. ‘Come,’ said he,yoo‘catch hold and I’ll pull you out.’ And he began cautiously pulling heryooout. He had just pulled her right out, when the other sinners in the lake,yooseeing how she was being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to beyoopulled out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began kickingyoothem. ‘I’m to be pulled out, not you. It’s my onion, not yours.’ As soonyooas she said that, the onion broke. And the woman fell into the lake andyooshe is burning there to this day. So the angel wept and went away. Soyoothat’s the story, Alyosha; I know it by heart, for I am that wicked womanyoomyself. I boasted to Rakitin that I had given away an onion, but to youyooI’ll say: ‘I’ve done nothing but give away one onion all my life, that’syoothe only good deed I’ve done.’ So don’t praise me, Alyosha, don’t think meyoogood, I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you praiseyoome. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen, Alyosha. I was so anxious toyooget hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five roubles if he wouldyoobring you to me. Stay, Rakitin, wait!”yooyooShe went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled out ayoopurse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.yooyoo“What nonsense! What nonsense!” cried Rakitin, disconcerted.yooyoo“Take it. Rakitin, I owe it you, there’s no fear of your refusing it, youyooasked for it yourself.” And she threw the note to him.yooyoo“Likely I should refuse it,” boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed, butyoocarrying off his confusion with a swagger. “That will come in very handy;yoofools are made for wise men’s profit.”yooyoo“And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say now is not foryooyour ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet. You don’t like us, soyoohold your tongue.”yooyoo“What should I like you for?” Rakitin snarled, not concealing hisyooill-humor. He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket and he feltyooashamed at Alyosha’s seeing it. He had reckoned on receiving his paymentyoolater, without Alyosha’s knowing of it, and now, feeling ashamed, he lostyoohis temper. Till that moment he had thought it discreet not to contradictyooGrushenka too flatly in spite of her snubbing, since he had something toyooget out of her. But now he, too, was angry:yooyoo“One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you done foryoome?”yooyoo“You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.”yooyoo“How does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make such a fussyooabout it?”yooyooGrushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke with heat andyoothere were hysterical notes in her voice.yooyoo“Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And don’t dare to speak to meyoolike that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in that corner and beyooquiet, as though you were my footman! And now, Alyosha, I’ll tell you theyoowhole truth, that you may see what a wretch I am! I am not talking toyooRakitin, but to you. I wanted to ruin you, Alyosha, that’s the holy truth;yooI quite meant to. I wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you.yooAnd why did I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha,yooyou turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes. And I’veyoolooked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking every oneyooabout you. Your face haunted my heart. ‘He despises me,’ I thought; ‘heyoowon’t even look at me.’ And I felt it so much at last that I wondered atyoomyself for being so frightened of a boy. I’ll get him in my clutches andyoolaugh at him. I was full of spite and anger. Would you believe it, nobodyyoohere dares talk or think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evilyoopurpose. Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here; I wasyoobound and sold to him; Satan brought us together, but there has been noyooone else. But looking at you, I thought, I’ll get him in my clutches andyoolaugh at him. You see what a spiteful cur I am, and you called me youryoosister! And now that man who wronged me has come; I sit here waiting for ayoomessage from him. And do you know what that man has been to me? Five yearsyooago, when Kuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no oneyoomight have sight or sound of me. I was a silly slip of a girl; I used toyoosit here sobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: ‘Where is heyoonow, the man who wronged me? He is laughing at me with another woman, mostyoolikely. If only I could see him, if I could meet him again, I’d pay himyooout, I’d pay him out!’ At night I used to lie sobbing into my pillow inyoothe dark, and I used to brood over it; I used to tear my heart on purposeyooand gloat over my anger. ‘I’ll pay him out, I’ll pay him out!’ That’s whatyooI used to cry out in the dark. And when I suddenly thought that I shouldyooreally do nothing to him, and that he was laughing at me then, or perhapsyoohad utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the floor, melt intoyoohelpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn. In the morning I wouldyooget up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the whole world to pieces.yooAnd then what do you think? I began saving money, I became hard-hearted,yoogrew stout—grew wiser, would you say? No, no one in the whole world seesyooit, no one knows it, but when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I didyoofive years ago, when I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and crying allyoonight, thinking, ‘I’ll pay him out, I’ll pay him out!’ Do you hear? Wellyoothen, now you understand me. A month ago a letter came to me—he wasyoocoming, he was a widower, he wanted to see me. It took my breath away;yoothen I suddenly thought: ‘If he comes and whistles to call me, I shallyoocreep back to him like a beaten dog.’ I couldn’t believe myself. Am I soyooabject? Shall I run to him or not? And I’ve been in such a rage withyoomyself all this month that I am worse than I was five years ago. Do youyoosee now, Alyosha, what a violent, vindictive creature I am? I have shownyooyou the whole truth! I played with Mitya to keep me from running to thatyooother. Hush, Rakitin, it’s not for you to judge me, I am not speaking toyooyou. Before you came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding myyoowhole future life, and you can never know what was in my heart. Yes,yooAlyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happenedyoothe day before yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world knows what I amyoogoing through now, and no one ever can know.... For perhaps I shall take ayooknife with me to-day, I can’t make up my mind ...”yooyooAnd at this “tragic” phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face in heryoohands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a little child.yooyooAlyosha got up and went to Rakitin.yooyoo“Misha,” he said, “don’t be angry. She wounded you, but don’t be angry.yooYou heard what she said just now? You mustn’t ask too much of humanyooendurance, one must be merciful.”yooyooAlyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He feltyooobliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not been there,yoohe would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked at him ironically andyooAlyosha stopped short.yooyoo“You were so primed up with your elder’s teaching last night that now youyoohave to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!” said Rakitin, with a smileyooof hatred.yooyoo“Don’t laugh, Rakitin, don’t smile, don’t talk of the dead—he was betteryoothan any one in the world!” cried Alyosha, with tears in his voice. “Iyoodidn’t speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the judged. What am Iyoobeside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and said to myself, ‘What does ityoomatter?’ in my cowardliness, but she, after five years in torment, as soonyooas any one says a word from the heart to her—it makes her forgetyooeverything, forgive everything, in her tears! The man who has wronged heryoohas come back, he sends for her and she forgives him everything, andyoohastens joyfully to meet him and she won’t take a knife with her. Sheyoowon’t! No, I am not like that. I don’t know whether you are, Misha, but Iyooam not like that. It’s a lesson to me.... She is more loving than we....yooHave you heard her speak before of what she has just told us? No, youyoohaven’t; if you had, you’d have understood her long ago ... and the personyooinsulted the day before yesterday must forgive her, too! She will, whenyooshe knows ... and she shall know.... This soul is not yet at peace withyooitself, one must be tender with it ... there may be a treasure in thatyoosoul....”yooyooAlyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his ill-humoryooRakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never expected such ayootirade from the gentle Alyosha.yooyoo“She’s found some one to plead her cause! Why, are you in love with her?yooAgrafena Alexandrovna, our monk’s really in love with you, you’ve made ayooconquest!” he cried, with a coarse laugh.yooyooGrushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha with ayootender smile shining on her tear-stained face.yooyoo“Let him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is not a personyoofor you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch,” she turned to Rakitin, “I meantyooto beg your pardon for being rude to you, but now I don’t want to.yooAlyosha, come to me, sit down here.” She beckoned to him with a happyyoosmile. “That’s right, sit here. Tell me,” she shook him by the hand andyoopeeped into his face, smiling, “tell me, do I love that man or not? theyooman who wronged me, do I love him or not? Before you came, I lay here inyoothe dark, asking my heart whether I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, theyootime has come, it shall be as you say. Am I to forgive him or not?”yooyoo“But you have forgiven him already,” said Alyosha, smiling.yooyoo“Yes, I really have forgiven him,” Grushenka murmured thoughtfully. “Whatyooan abject heart! To my abject heart!” She snatched up a glass from theyootable, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air and flung it on theyoofloor. The glass broke with a crash. A little cruel line came into heryoosmile.yooyoo“Perhaps I haven’t forgiven him, though,” she said, with a sort of menaceyooin her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as though she wereyootalking to herself. “Perhaps my heart is only getting ready to forgive. Iyooshall struggle with my heart. You see, Alyosha, I’ve grown to love myyootears in these five years.... Perhaps I only love my resentment, not himyoo...”yooyoo“Well, I shouldn’t care to be in his shoes,” hissed Rakitin.yooyoo“Well, you won’t be, Rakitin, you’ll never be in his shoes. You shallyooblack my shoes, Rakitin, that’s the place you are fit for. You’ll neveryooget a woman like me ... and he won’t either, perhaps ...”yooyoo“Won’t he? Then why are you dressed up like that?” said Rakitin, with ayoovenomous sneer.yooyoo“Don’t taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don’t know all that is inyoomy heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, I’ll tear it off at once,yoothis minute,” she cried in a resonant voice. “You don’t know what thatyoofinery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see him and say: ‘Have you everyooseen me look like this before?’ He left me a thin, consumptive cry-baby ofyooseventeen. I’ll sit by him, fascinate him and work him up. ‘Do you seeyoowhat I am like now?’ I’ll say to him; ‘well, and that’s enough for you, myyoodear sir, there’s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip!’ That may be whatyoothe finery is for, Rakitin.” Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh.yoo“I’m violent and resentful, Alyosha, I’ll tear off my finery, I’ll destroyyoomy beauty, I’ll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and turn beggar. IfyooI choose, I won’t go anywhere now to see any one. If I choose, I’ll sendyooKuzma back all he has ever given me, to-morrow, and all his money and I’llyoogo out charing for the rest of my life. You think I wouldn’t do it,yooRakitin, that I would not dare to do it? I would, I would, I could do ityoodirectly, only don’t exasperate me ... and I’ll send him about hisyoobusiness, I’ll snap my fingers in his face, he shall never see me again!”yooyooShe uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke down again,yoohid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and shook with sobs.yooyooRakitin got up.yooyoo“It’s time we were off,” he said, “it’s late, we shall be shut out of theyoomonastery.”yooyooGrushenka leapt up from her place.yooyoo“Surely you don’t want to go, Alyosha!” she cried, in mournful surprise.yoo“What are you doing to me? You’ve stirred up my feeling, tortured me, andyoonow you’ll leave me to face this night alone!”yooyoo“He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants to, let him!yooI’ll go alone,” Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.yooyoo“Hush, evil tongue!” Grushenka cried angrily at him; “you never said suchyoowords to me as he has come to say.”yooyoo“What has he said to you so special?” asked Rakitin irritably.yooyoo“I can’t say, I don’t know. I don’t know what he said to me, it wentyoostraight to my heart; he has wrung my heart.... He is the first, the onlyyooone who has pitied me, that’s what it is. Why did you not come before, youyooangel?” She fell on her knees before him as though in a sudden frenzy.yoo“I’ve been waiting all my life for some one like you, I knew that some oneyoolike you would come and forgive me. I believed that, nasty as I am, someyooone would really love me, not only with a shameful love!”yooyoo“What have I done to you?” answered Alyosha, bending over her with ayootender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; “I only gave you anyooonion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was all!”yooyooHe was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment there was ayoosudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall. Grushenka jumpedyooup, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran noisily into the room, crying out:yooyoo“Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,” she cried,yoobreathless and joyful. “A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey theyoodriver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses.... Ayooletter, here’s the letter, mistress.”yooyooA letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while sheyootalked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to theyoocandle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant.yooyoo“He has sent for me,” she cried, her face white and distorted, with a wanyoosmile; “he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!”yooyooBut only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly theyooblood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.yooyoo“I will go,” she cried; “five years of my life! Good-by! Good-by, Alyosha,yoomy fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don’t let me see youyooagain! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don’t you remember evilyooagainst me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh! I feel asyoothough I were drunk!”yooyooShe suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.yooyoo“Well, she has no thoughts for us now!” grumbled Rakitin. “Let’s go, or weyoomay hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all these tears andyoocries.”yooyooAlyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood a coveredyoocart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to andyoofro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate.yooBut when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka’syoobedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice afteryooAlyosha:yooyoo“Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not toyooremember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him,yootoo, in my words: ‘Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you,yoonoble heart.’ And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, onlyyooone short hour she loved him—so let him remember that hour all hisyoolife—say, ‘Grushenka tells you to!’ ”yooyooShe ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam.yooyoo“H’m, h’m!” growled Rakitin, laughing, “she murders your brother Mitya andyoothen tells him to remember it all his life! What ferocity!”yooyooAlyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked fast besideyooRakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in thought and movedyoomechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as though he had been touchedyooon an open wound. He had expected something quite different by bringingyooGrushenka and Alyosha together. Something very different from what he hadyoohoped for had happened.yooyoo“He is a Pole, that officer of hers,” he began again, restraining himself;yoo“and indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in the customs inyooSiberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some puny little beggar of ayooPole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. He’s heard now that Grushenka’syoosaved a little money, so he’s turned up again—that’s the explanation ofyoothe mystery.”yooyooAgain Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control himself.yooyoo“Well, so you’ve saved the sinner?” he laughed spitefully. “Have youyooturned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the seven devils, eh?yooSo you see the miracles you were looking out for just now have come toyoopass!”yooyoo“Hush, Rakitin,” Alyosha answered with an aching heart.yooyoo“So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I’ve sold my friend,yooyou think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am not Judas.”yooyoo“Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I’d forgotten about it,” cried Alyosha, “youyooremind me of it yourself....”yooyooBut this was the last straw for Rakitin.yooyoo“Damnation take you all and each of you!” he cried suddenly, “why theyoodevil did I take you up? I don’t want to know you from this time forward.yooGo alone, there’s your road!”yooyooAnd he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha alone in theyoodark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked across the fields to theyoomonastery.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. Cana Of GalileeyooyooyooIt was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha returnedyooto the hermitage; the door-keeper let him in by a special entrance. It hadyoostruck nine o’clock—the hour of rest and repose after a day of suchyooagitation for all. Alyosha timidly opened the door and went into theyooelder’s cell where his coffin was now standing. There was no one in theyoocell but Father Païssy, reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin,yooand the young novice Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night’syooconversation and the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping theyoodeep sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though FatheryooPaïssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction.yooAlyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his kneesyooand began to pray.yooyooHis soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single sensationyoostood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another in a slow,yoocontinual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart and, strange toyoosay, Alyosha was not surprised at it. Again he saw that coffin before him,yoothe hidden dead figure so precious to him, but the weeping and poignantyoogrief of the morning was no longer aching in his soul. As soon as he cameyooin, he fell down before the coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joyyoowas glowing in his mind and in his heart. The one window of the cell wasyooopen, the air was fresh and cool. “So the smell must have become stronger,yooif they opened the window,” thought Alyosha. But even this thought of theyoosmell of corruption, which had seemed to him so awful and humiliating ayoofew hours before, no longer made him feel miserable or indignant. He beganyooquietly praying, but he soon felt that he was praying almost mechanically.yooFragments of thought floated through his soul, flashed like stars and wentyooout again at once, to be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigningyooin his soul a sense of the wholeness of things—something steadfast andyoocomforting—and he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began prayingyooardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love....yooyooBut when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something else, andyoosank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what had interrupted it.yooHe began listening to what Father Païssy was reading, but worn out withyooexhaustion he gradually began to doze.yooyoo“_And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;_” read FatheryooPaïssy. “_And the mother of Jesus was there; And both Jesus was called,yooand his disciples, to the marriage._”yooyoo“Marriage? What’s that?... A marriage!” floated whirling through Alyosha’syoomind. “There is happiness for her, too.... She has gone to the feast....yooNo, she has not taken the knife.... That was only a tragic phrase.... Wellyoo... tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must be. Tragic phrasesyoocomfort the heart.... Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men toyoobear. Rakitin has gone off to the back alley. As long as Rakitin broodsyooover his wrongs, he will always go off to the back alley.... But the highyooroad ... The road is wide and straight and bright as crystal, and the sunyoois at the end of it.... Ah!... What’s being read?”...yooyoo“_And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They haveyoono wine_” ... Alyosha heard.yooyoo“Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn’t want to miss it, I love thatyoopassage: it’s Cana of Galilee, the first miracle.... Ah, that miracle! Ah,yoothat sweet miracle! It was not men’s grief, but their joy Christ visited,yooHe worked His first miracle to help men’s gladness.... ‘He who loves menyooloves their gladness, too’ ... He was always repeating that, it was one ofyoohis leading ideas.... ‘There’s no living without joy,’ Mitya says.... Yes,yooMitya.... ‘Everything that is true and good is always full ofyooforgiveness,’ he used to say that, too” ...yooyoo“_Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what has it to do with thee or me? Mineyoohour is not yet come._yooyoo“_His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, doyooit_” ...yooyoo“Do it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor, people.... Ofyoocourse they were poor, since they hadn’t wine enough even at a wedding....yooThe historians write that, in those days, the people living about the Lakeyooof Gennesaret were the poorest that can possibly be imagined ... andyooanother great heart, that other great being, His Mother, knew that He hadyoocome not only to make His great terrible sacrifice. She knew that Hisyooheart was open even to the simple, artless merrymaking of some obscure andyoounlearned people, who had warmly bidden Him to their poor wedding. ‘Mineyoohour is not yet come,’ He said, with a soft smile (He must have smiledyoogently to her). And, indeed, was it to make wine abundant at poor weddingsyooHe had come down to earth? And yet He went and did as she asked Him....yooAh, he is reading again”....yooyoo“_Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filledyoothem up to the brim._yooyoo“_And he saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor of theyoofeast. And they bare it._yooyoo“_When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, andyooknew not whence it was; (but the servants which drew the water knew;) theyoogovernor of the feast called the bridegroom,_yooyoo“_And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;yooand when men have well drunk, that which is worse; but thou hast kept theyoogood wine until now._”yooyoo“But what’s this, what’s this? Why is the room growing wider?... Ah, yesyoo... It’s the marriage, the wedding ... yes, of course. Here are theyooguests, here are the young couple sitting, and the merry crowd and ...yooWhere is the wise governor of the feast? But who is this? Who? Again theyoowalls are receding.... Who is getting up there from the great table?yooWhat!... He here, too? But he’s in the coffin ... but he’s here, too. Heyoohas stood up, he sees me, he is coming here.... God!”...yooyooYes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man, with tinyyoowrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There was no coffin now,yooand he was in the same dress as he had worn yesterday sitting with them,yoowhen the visitors had gathered about him. His face was uncovered, his eyesyoowere shining. How was this, then? He, too, had been called to the feast.yooHe, too, at the marriage of Cana in Galilee....yooyoo“Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,” he heard a soft voiceyoosaying over him. “Why have you hidden yourself here, out of sight? Youyoocome and join us too.”yooyooIt was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be he, since heyoocalled him!yooyooThe elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his knees.yooyoo“We are rejoicing,” the little, thin old man went on. “We are drinking theyoonew wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see how many guests?yooHere are the bride and bridegroom, here is the wise governor of the feast,yoohe is tasting the new wine. Why do you wonder at me? I gave an onion to ayoobeggar, so I, too, am here. And many here have given only an onionyooeach—only one little onion.... What are all our deeds? And you, my gentleyooone, you, my kind boy, you too have known how to give a famished woman anyooonion to-day. Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!... Do youyoosee our Sun, do you see Him?”yooyoo“I am afraid ... I dare not look,” whispered Alyosha.yooyoo“Do not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His sublimity,yoobut infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto us from love andyoorejoices with us. He is changing the water into wine that the gladness ofyoothe guests may not be cut short. He is expecting new guests, He is callingyoonew ones unceasingly for ever and ever.... There they are bringing newyoowine. Do you see they are bringing the vessels....”yooyooSomething glowed in Alyosha’s heart, something filled it till it ached,yootears of rapture rose from his soul.... He stretched out his hands,yoouttered a cry and waked up.yooyooAgain the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct readingyooof the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the reading. It was strange,yoohe had fallen asleep on his knees, but now he was on his feet, andyoosuddenly, as though thrown forward, with three firm rapid steps he wentyooright up to the coffin. His shoulder brushed against Father Païssy withoutyoohis noticing it. Father Païssy raised his eyes for an instant from hisyoobook, but looked away again at once, seeing that something strange wasyoohappening to the boy. Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, atyoothe covered, motionless dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon onyoohis breast and the peaked cap with the octangular cross, on his head. Heyoohad only just been hearing his voice, and that voice was still ringing inyoohis ears. He was listening, still expecting other words, but suddenly heyooturned sharply and went out of the cell.yooyooHe did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his soul,yoooverflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness. The vaultyooof heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched vast and fathomlessyooabove him. The Milky Way ran in two pale streams from the zenith to theyoohorizon. The fresh, motionless, still night enfolded the earth. The whiteyootowers and golden domes of the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphireyoosky. The gorgeous autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, wereyooslumbering till morning. The silence of earth seemed to melt into theyoosilence of the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery ofyoothe stars....yooyooAlyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the earth. He didyoonot know why he embraced it. He could not have told why he longed soyooirresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he kissed it weeping, sobbingyooand watering it with his tears, and vowed passionately to love it, to loveyooit for ever and ever. “Water the earth with the tears of your joy and loveyoothose tears,” echoed in his soul.yooyooWhat was he weeping over?yooyooOh! in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars, which wereyooshining to him from the abyss of space, and “he was not ashamed of thatyooecstasy.” There seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds ofyooGod, linking his soul to them, and it was trembling all over “in contactyoowith other worlds.” He longed to forgive every one and for everything, andyooto beg forgiveness. Oh, not for himself, but for all men, for all and foryooeverything. “And others are praying for me too,” echoed again in his soul.yooBut with every instant he felt clearly and, as it were, tangibly, thatyoosomething firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into hisyoosoul. It was as though some idea had seized the sovereignty of hisyoomind—and it was for all his life and for ever and ever. He had fallen onyoothe earth a weak boy, but he rose up a resolute champion, and he knew andyoofelt it suddenly at the very moment of his ecstasy. And never, never, allyoohis life long, could Alyosha forget that minute.yooyoo“Some one visited my soul in that hour,” he used to say afterwards, withyooimplicit faith in his words.yooyooWithin three days he left the monastery in accordance with the words ofyoohis elder, who had bidden him “sojourn in the world.”yooyooyooyooyooBook VIII. MityayooyooyooyooChapter I. Kuzma SamsonovyooyooyooBut Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had left heryoolast greetings, bidding him remember the hour of her love for ever, knewyoonothing of what had happened to her, and was at that moment in a conditionyooof feverish agitation and activity. For the last two days he had been inyoosuch an inconceivable state of mind that he might easily have fallen illyoowith brain fever, as he said himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been ableyooto find him the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting himyooat the tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by his orders,yooconcealed his movements.yooyooHe had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions,yoo“struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself,” as he expressedyooit himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a dash out of theyootown on urgent business, terrible as it was to him to lose sight ofyooGrushenka for a moment. All this was explained afterwards in detail, andyooconfirmed by documentary evidence; but for the present we will only noteyoothe most essential incidents of those two terrible days immediatelyyoopreceding the awful catastrophe, that broke so suddenly upon him.yooyooThough Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour, genuinely andyoosincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and mercilessly. Theyooworst of it was that he could never tell what she meant to do. To prevailyooupon her by force or kindness was also impossible: she would yield toyoonothing. She would only have become angry and turned away from himyooaltogether, he knew that well already. He suspected, quite correctly, thatyooshe, too, was passing through an inward struggle, and was in a state ofyooextraordinary indecision, that she was making up her mind to something,yooand unable to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, heyoodivined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate himyooand his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressingyooGrushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting question layyoobetween him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.yooyooHere, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuadedyoothat Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenkayoolawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuaryyoohoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reachedyoothis conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. Thatyoowas how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka’syoouneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was mostyooto her advantage.yooyooStrange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of theyooapproaching return of the “officer,” that is, of the man who had been suchyooa fatal influence in Grushenka’s life, and whose arrival she was expectingyoowith such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had beenyoovery silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she hadyooreceived a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her ownyoolips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spiteyooGrushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attachedyoohardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was.yooPerhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with hisyooown father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger moreyooterrible, at any rate for the time. He simply did not believe in a suitoryoowho suddenly turned up again after five years’ disappearance, still lessyooin his speedy arrival. Moreover, in the “officer’s” first letter which hadyoobeen shown to Mitya, the possibility of his new rival’s visit was veryyoovaguely suggested. The letter was very indefinite, high-flown, and full ofyoosentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him theyoolast lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to moreyoodefinitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he rememberedyooafterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive fromyooSiberia on Grushenka’s face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passedyoolater between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completelyyooforgotten the officer’s existence.yooyooHe felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take,yoohis final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and must beyoodecided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was expecting everyyoomoment Grushenka’s decision, always believing that it would come suddenly,yooon the impulse of the moment. All of a sudden she would say to him: “Takeyoome, I’m yours for ever,” and it would all be over. He would seize her andyoobear her away at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear heryooaway at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia,yooif not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle down with heryooincognito, so that no one would know anything about them, there, here, oryooanywhere. Then, oh, then, a new life would begin at once!yooyooOf this different, reformed and “virtuous” life (“it must, it must beyoovirtuous”) he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He thirsted for thatyooreformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in which he had sunk of hisyooown free will, was too revolting to him, and, like very many men in suchyoocases, he put faith above all in change of place. If only it were not foryoothese people, if only it were not for these circumstances, if only heyoocould fly away from this accursed place—he would be altogetheryooregenerated, would enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, andyoowhat he was yearning for.yooyooBut all this could only be on condition of the first, the _happy_ solutionyooof the question. There was another possibility, a different and awfulyooending. Suddenly she might say to him: “Go away. I have just come to termsyoowith Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to marry him and don’t want you”—andyoothen ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up toyoothe last hour he didn’t know. That must be said to his credit. He had noyoodefinite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching andyoospying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy solutionyooof his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But for that endingyooa quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal andyooinsoluble difficulty presented itself.yooyooIf she were to say to him: “I’m yours; take me away,” how could he takeyooher away? Where had he the means, the money to do it? It was just at thisyootime that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles which hadyoogone on without interruption for so many years, ceased. Grushenka hadyoomoney, of course, but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evincedyooextraordinary pride; he wanted to carry her away and begin the new lifeyoowith her himself, at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceiveyooof taking her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of intenseyoorepulsion. I won’t enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confineyoomyself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All this mayyoohave arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of hisyooconscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had dishonestlyyooappropriated. “I’ve been a scoundrel to one of them, and I shall be ayooscoundrel again to the other directly,” was his feeling then, as heyooexplained after: “and when Grushenka knows, she won’t care for such ayooscoundrel.”yooyooWhere then was he to get the means, where was he to get the fateful money?yooWithout it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, “and only becauseyooI hadn’t the money. Oh, the shame of it!”yooyooTo anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the money, knew,yooperhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no more of this here, asyooit will all be clear later. But his chief trouble, I must explain howeveryooobscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of, to _have theyooright_ to take it, he must first restore Katerina Ivanovna’s threeyoothousand—if not, “I’m a common pickpocket, I’m a scoundrel, and I don’tyoowant to begin a new life as a scoundrel,” Mitya decided. And so he made upyoohis mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that threeyoothousand, and that _first of all_. The final stage of this decision, so toyoosay, had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his lastyoointerview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high-road, on the eveningyoowhen Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearingyooAlyosha’s account of it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and toldyoohim to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her. Afteryooparting from his brother on that night, he had felt in his frenzy that ityoowould be better “to murder and rob some one than fail to pay my debt toyooKatya. I’d rather every one thought me a robber and a murderer, I’d ratheryoogo to Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceivedyooher and stole her money, and used her money to run away with Grushenka andyoobegin a new life! That I can’t do!” So Mitya decided, grinding his teeth,yooand he might well fancy at times that his brain would give way. Butyoomeanwhile he went on struggling....yooyooStrange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing left foryoohim but despair—for what chance had he, with nothing in the world, toyooraise such a sum?—yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he wouldyooget that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him ofyooitself, as though it might drop from heaven. That is just how it is withyoopeople who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money, exceptyooto squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort ofyootheir own, and have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl of the mostyoofantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately after he hadyooparted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his thoughts into a tangleyooof confusion. This is how it was he pitched first on a perfectly wildyooenterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind in such circumstances the mostyooimpossible, fantastic schemes occur first, and seem most practical.yooyooHe suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who was Grushenka’syooprotector, and to propose a “scheme” to him, and by means of it to obtainyoofrom him at once the whole of the sum required. Of the commercial value ofyoohis scheme he had no doubt, not the slightest, and was only uncertain howyooSamsonov would look upon his freak, supposing he were to consider it fromyooany but the commercial point of view. Though Mitya knew the merchant byyoosight, he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him.yooBut for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction thatyoothe old reprobate, who was lying at death’s door, would perhaps not at allyooobject now to Grushenka’s securing a respectable position, and marrying ayooman “to be depended upon.” And he believed not only that he would notyooobject, but that this was what he desired, and, if opportunity arose, thatyoohe would be ready to help. From some rumor, or perhaps from some strayyooword of Grushenka’s, he had gathered further that the old man wouldyooperhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.yooyooPossibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning onyoosuch assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from theyoohands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want ofyoodelicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka’s past asyoosomething completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity andyooresolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka toldyoohim she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of ayoonew Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgiveyooone another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov,yooDmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence inyoothat remote past of Grushenka’s, though she had never loved him, and whoyoowas now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say,yoonon-existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, foryooit was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck,yoowhose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were nowyoosimply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time.yooyooIn any case there was much simplicity on Mitya’s part in all this, for inyoospite of all his vices, he was a very simple-hearted man. It was anyooinstance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded that, beingyooon the eve of his departure for the next world, old Kuzma must sincerelyyoorepent of his past relations with Grushenka, and that she had no moreyoodevoted friend and protector in the world than this, now harmless old man.yooyooAfter his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he hardly sleptyooall night, and at ten o’clock next morning, he was at the house ofyooSamsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It was a very large andyoogloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and outhouses. In the loweryoostory lived Samsonov’s two married sons with their families, his oldyoosister, and his unmarried daughter. In the lodge lived two of his clerks,yooone of whom also had a large family. Both the lodge and the lower storyyoowere overcrowded, but the old man kept the upper floor to himself, andyoowould not even let the daughter live there with him, though she waitedyooupon him, and in spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours,yooand at any time he might call her, to run upstairs to him from below.yooyooThis upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely for show,yoofurnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long monotonous rowsyooof clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with glass chandeliers underyooshades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls. All these rooms were entirelyyooempty and unused, for the old man kept to one room, a small, remoteyoobedroom, where he was waited upon by an old servant with a kerchief on heryoohead, and by a lad, who used to sit on the locker in the passage. Owing toyoohis swollen legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was onlyyoorarely lifted from his leather arm-chair, when the old woman supportingyoohim led him up and down the room once or twice. He was morose and taciturnyooeven with this old woman.yooyooWhen he was informed of the arrival of the “captain,” he at once refusedyooto see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again. Samsonovyooquestioned the lad minutely: What he looked like? Whether he was drunk?yooWas he going to make a row? The answer he received was: that he was sober,yoobut wouldn’t go away. The old man again refused to see him. Then Mitya,yoowho had foreseen this, and purposely brought pencil and paper with him,yoowrote clearly on the piece of paper the words: “On most important businessyooclosely concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,” and sent it up to the old man.yooyooAfter thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to theyoodrawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to hisyooyounger son to come upstairs to him at once. This younger son, a man overyoosix foot and of exceptional physical strength, who was closely-shaven andyoodressed in the European style, though his father still wore a kaftan and ayoobeard, came at once without a comment. All the family trembled before theyoofather. The old man had sent for this giant, not because he was afraid ofyoothe “captain” (he was by no means of a timorous temper), but in order toyoohave a witness in case of any emergency. Supported by his son and theyooservant-lad, he waddled at last into the drawing-room. It may be assumedyoothat he felt considerable curiosity. The drawing-room in which Mitya wasyooawaiting him was a vast, dreary room that laid a weight of depression onyoothe heart. It had a double row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, andyoothree immense chandeliers with glass lusters covered with shades.yooyooMitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his fateyoowith nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the opposite door,yooseventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with his long, militaryyoostride walked to meet him. Mitya was well dressed, in a frock-coat,yoobuttoned up, with a round hat and black gloves in his hands, just as heyoohad been three days before at the elder’s, at the family meeting with hisyoofather and brothers. The old man waited for him, standing dignified andyoounbending, and Mitya felt at once that he had looked him through andyoothrough as he advanced. Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov’syooimmensely swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been thick, hungyoodown now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest in dignified silence,yoomotioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and, leaning on his son’s arm heyoobegan lowering himself on to the sofa opposite, groaning painfully, soyoothat Mitya, seeing his painful exertions, immediately felt remorseful andyoosensitively conscious of his insignificance in the presence of theyoodignified person he had ventured to disturb.yooyoo“What is it you want of me, sir?” said the old man, deliberately,yoodistinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last seated.yooyooMitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at onceyoospeaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positiveyoofrenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on the brink ofyooruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he failed. Old Samsonovyooprobably grasped all this in an instant, though his face remained cold andyooimmovable as a statue’s.yooyoo“Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard more than onceyooof my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, who robbed meyooof my inheritance from my mother ... seeing the whole town is gossipingyooabout it ... for here every one’s gossiping of what they shouldn’t ... andyoobesides, it might have reached you through Grushenka ... I beg youryoopardon, through Agrafena Alexandrovna ... Agrafena Alexandrovna, the ladyyoofor whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...”yooyooSo Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will notyooreproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize the gist ofyooit. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention (Mityayoopurposely used these words instead of “intentionally”) consulted a lawyeryooin the chief town of the province, “a distinguished lawyer, KuzmayooKuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov. You have perhaps heard of him? Ayooman of vast intellect, the mind of a statesman ... he knows you, too ...yoospoke of you in the highest terms ...” Mitya broke down again. But theseyoobreaks did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggledyooon and on.yooyooThis Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting theyoodocuments he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat vaguely toyoothese documents, and slurred over the subject with special haste),yooreported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning the villageyooof Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to have come to him, Mitya, fromyoohis mother, and so checkmate the old villain, his father ... “becauseyooevery door was not closed and justice might still find a loophole.” Inyoofact, he might reckon on an additional sum of six or even seven thousandyooroubles from Fyodor Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least,yootwenty-five thousand, he might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact,yoo“thirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didn’t getyooseventeen from that heartless man!” So he, Mitya, had thrown the businessyooup, for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on coming here wasyoostruck dumb by a cross-claim made upon him (here Mitya went adrift againyooand again took a flying leap forward), “so will not you, excellent andyoohonored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take up all my claims against thatyoounnatural monster, and pay me a sum down of only three thousand?... Youyoosee, you cannot, in any case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swearyoothat. Quite the contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead ofyoothree.” Above all, he wanted this concluded that very day.yooyoo“I’ll do the business with you at a notary’s, or whatever it is ... inyoofact, I’m ready to do anything.... I’ll hand over all the deeds ...yoowhatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw up the agreement atyooonce ... and if it were possible, if it were only possible, that veryyoomorning.... You could pay me that three thousand, for there isn’t ayoocapitalist in this town to compare with you, and so would save me from ...yoowould save me, in fact ... for a good, I might say an honorable action....yooFor I cherish the most honorable feelings for a certain person, whom youyooknow well, and care for as a father. I would not have come, indeed, if ityoohad not been as a father. And, indeed, it’s a struggle of three in thisyoobusiness, for it’s fate—that’s a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch! A tragedy,yooKuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as you’ve dropped out long ago, it’s ayootug-of-war between two. I’m expressing it awkwardly, perhaps, but I’m notyooa literary man. You see, I’m on the one side, and that monster on theyooother. So you must choose. It’s either I or the monster. It all lies inyooyour hands—the fate of three lives, and the happiness of two.... Excuseyoome, I’m making a mess of it, but you understand ... I see from youryoovenerable eyes that you understand ... and if you don’t understand, I’myoodone for ... so you see!”yooyooMitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, “so you see!” and jumping upyoofrom his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish proposal. At the lastyoophrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all fallenyooflat, above all, that he had been talking utter nonsense.yooyoo“How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and now it’syoonothing but nonsense.” The idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind.yooAll the while he had been talking, the old man sat motionless, watchingyoohim with an icy expression in his eyes. After keeping him for a moment inyoosuspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive andyoochilling tone:yooyoo“Excuse me, we don’t undertake such business.”yooyooMitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.yooyoo“What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?” he muttered, with a pale smile. “Iyoosuppose it’s all up with me—what do you think?”yooyoo“Excuse me....”yooyooMitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed ayoomovement in the old man’s face. He started.yooyoo“You see, sir, business of that sort’s not in our line,” said the old manyooslowly. “There’s the court, and the lawyers—it’s a perfect misery. But ifyooyou like, there is a man here you might apply to.”yooyoo“Good heavens! Who is it? You’re my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,” falteredyooMitya.yooyoo“He doesn’t live here, and he’s not here just now. He is a peasant, heyoodoes business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He’s been haggling withyooFyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse at Tchermashnya. Theyyoocan’t agree on the price, maybe you’ve heard? Now he’s come back again andyoois staying with the priest at Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from theyooVolovya station. He wrote to me, too, about the business of the copse,yooasking my advice. Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him himself. So ifyooyou were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy theyoooffer you’ve made me, he might possibly—”yooyoo“A brilliant idea!” Mitya interrupted ecstatically. “He’s the very man, ityoowould just suit him. He’s haggling with him for it, being asked too much,yooand here he would have all the documents entitling him to the propertyyooitself. Ha ha ha!”yooyooAnd Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh, startlingyooSamsonov.yooyoo“How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?” cried Mitya effusively.yooyoo“Don’t mention it,” said Samsonov, inclining his head.yooyoo“But you don’t know, you’ve saved me. Oh, it was a true presentimentyoobrought me to you.... So now to this priest!”yooyoo“No need of thanks.”yooyoo“I’ll make haste and fly there. I’m afraid I’ve overtaxed your strength. Iyooshall never forget it. It’s a Russian says that, Kuzma Kuzmitch, ayooR-r-russian!”yooyoo“To be sure!”yooyooMitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a malignant gleam in theyooold man’s eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but at once blamed himself foryoohis mistrustfulness.yooyoo“It’s because he’s tired,” he thought.yooyoo“For her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand that it’s foryooher,” he cried, his voice ringing through the room. He bowed, turnedyoosharply round, and with the same long stride walked to the door withoutyoolooking back. He was trembling with delight.yooyoo“Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved me,” wasyoothe thought in his mind. And if such a business man as Samsonov (a mostyooworthy old man, and what dignity!) had suggested this course, then ...yoothen success was assured. He would fly off immediately. “I will be backyoobefore night, I shall be back at night and the thing is done. Could theyooold man have been laughing at me?” exclaimed Mitya, as he strode towardsyoohis lodging. He could, of course, imagine nothing, but that the advice wasyoopractical “from such a business man” with an understanding of theyoobusiness, with an understanding of this Lyagavy (curious surname!). Or—theyooold man was laughing at him.yooyooAlas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long afterwards, whenyoothe catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself confessed, laughing,yoothat he had made a fool of the “captain.” He was a cold, spiteful andyoosarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies. Whether it was theyoo“captain’s” excited face, or the foolish conviction of the “rake andyoospendthrift,” that he, Samsonov, could be taken in by such a cock-and-bullyoostory as his scheme, or his jealousy of Grushenka, in whose name thisyoo“scapegrace” had rushed in on him with such a tale to get money whichyooworked on the old man, I can’t tell. But at the instant when Mitya stoodyoobefore him, feeling his legs grow weak under him, and franticallyyooexclaiming that he was ruined, at that moment the old man looked at himyoowith intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him. WhenyooMitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to his son andyoobade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again, and neveryooadmitted even into the yard, or else he’d—yooyooHe did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw him enraged,yootrembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the old man was shakingyoowith anger, and by evening he was worse, and sent for the doctor.yooyooyooyooChapter II. LyagavyyooyooyooSo he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for horses. Heyoohad forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was left after so many yearsyooof prosperity! But he had at home an old silver watch which had longyooceased to go. He snatched it up and carried it to a Jewish watchmaker whoyoohad a shop in the market-place. The Jew gave him six roubles for it.yooyoo“And I didn’t expect that,” cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was still in ayoostate of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran home. At home heyooborrowed three roubles from the people of the house, who loved him so muchyoothat they were pleased to give it him, though it was all they had. Mityayooin his excitement told them on the spot that his fate would be decidedyoothat day, and he described, in desperate haste, the whole scheme he hadyooput before Samsonov, the latter’s decision, his own hopes for the future,yooand so on. These people had been told many of their lodger’s secretsyoobefore, and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud,yooand almost one of themselves. Having thus collected nine roubles Mityayoosent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station. This was howyoothe fact came to be remembered and established that “at midday, on the dayyoobefore the event, Mitya had not a farthing, and that he had sold his watchyooto get money and had borrowed three roubles from his landlord, all in theyoopresence of witnesses.”yooyooI note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.yooyooThough he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would at lastyoosolve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya station, heyootrembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in his absence.yooWhat if she made up her mind to-day to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch? This wasyoowhy he had gone off without telling her and why he left orders with hisyoolandlady not to let out where he had gone, if any one came to inquire foryoohim.yooyoo“I must, I must get back to-night,” he repeated, as he was jolted along inyoothe cart, “and I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy back here ...yooto draw up the deed.” So mused Mitya, with a throbbing heart, but alas!yoohis dreams were not fated to be carried out.yooyooTo begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya station whichyooturned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve. Secondly, he did notyoofind the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had gone off to a neighboringyoovillage. While Mitya, setting off there with the same exhausted horses,yoowas looking for him, it was almost dark.yooyooThe priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him at onceyoothat though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he was now atyooSuhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the forester’s cottage,yooas he was buying timber there too. At Mitya’s urgent request that he wouldyootake him to Lyagavy at once, and by so doing “save him, so to speak,” theyoopriest agreed, after some demur, to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok; hisyoocuriosity was obviously aroused. But, unluckily, he advised their going onyoofoot, as it would not be “much over” a verst. Mitya, of course, agreed,yooand marched off with his yard-long strides, so that the poor priest almostyooran after him. He was a very cautious man, though not old.yooyooMitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously andyooexcitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all the way. Theyoopriest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He turned off Mitya’syooquestions with: “I don’t know. Ah, I can’t say. How can I tell?” and soyooon. When Mitya began to speak of his quarrel with his father over hisyooinheritance, the priest was positively alarmed, as he was in some wayyoodependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch. He inquired, however, with surprise, whyyoohe called the peasant-trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explainedyooto Mitya that, though the man’s name really was Lyagavy, he was neveryoocalled so, as he would be grievously offended at the name, and that heyoomust be sure to call him Gorstkin, “or you’ll do nothing with him; heyoowon’t even listen to you,” said the priest in conclusion.yooyooMitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that that wasyoowhat Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the priest dropped theyoosubject, though he would have done well to put into words his doubtyoowhether, if Samsonov had sent him to that peasant, calling him Lyagavy,yoothere was not something wrong about it and he was turning him intoyooridicule. But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles. He hurried,yoostriding along, and only when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realizeyoothat they had come not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three.yooThis annoyed him, but he controlled himself.yooyooThey went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the hut, andyooGorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the other side of theyoopassage. They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle. The hut wasyooextremely overheated. On the table there was a samovar that had gone out,yooa tray with cups, an empty rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, andyoosome half-eaten crusts of wheaten bread. The visitor himself lay stretchedyooat full length on the bench, with his coat crushed up under his head for ayoopillow, snoring heavily. Mitya stood in perplexity.yooyoo“Of course I must wake him. My business is too important. I’ve come inyoosuch haste. I’m in a hurry to get back to-day,” he said in greatyooagitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not givingyootheir opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake him himself; heyootried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.yooyoo“He’s drunk,” Mitya decided. “Good Lord! What am I to do? What am I toyoodo?” And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him by the arms, by theyoolegs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making him sit on the bench.yooYet, after prolonged exertions, he could only succeed in getting theyoodrunken man to utter absurd grunts, and violent, but inarticulate oaths.yooyoo“No, you’d better wait a little,” the priest pronounced at last, “for he’syooobviously not in a fit state.”yooyoo“He’s been drinking the whole day,” the forester chimed in.yooyoo“Good heavens!” cried Mitya. “If only you knew how important it is to meyooand how desperate I am!”yooyoo“No, you’d better wait till morning,” the priest repeated.yooyoo“Till morning? Mercy! that’s impossible!”yooyooAnd in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping manyooagain, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of hisyooefforts. The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.yooyoo“What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,” said Mitya, inyoocomplete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his face. The priestyooseized the moment to put before him, very reasonably, that, even if heyoosucceeded in wakening the man, he would still be drunk and incapable ofyooconversation. “And your business is important,” he said, “so you’dyoocertainly better put it off till morning.” With a gesture of despair Mityayooagreed.yooyoo“Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable moment. Asyoosoon as he wakes I’ll begin. I’ll pay you for the light,” he said to theyooforester, “for the night’s lodging, too; you’ll remember Dmitri Karamazov.yooOnly, Father, I don’t know what we’re to do with you. Where will youyoosleep?”yooyoo“No, I’m going home. I’ll take his horse and get home,” he said,yooindicating the forester. “And now I’ll say good-by. I wish you allyoosuccess.”yooyooSo it was settled. The priest rode off on the forester’s horse, delightedyooto escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering whether he oughtyoonot next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor Pavlovitch of this curiousyooincident, “or he may in an unlucky hour hear of it, be angry, and withdrawyoohis favor.”yooyooThe forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without a word,yooand Mitya sat on the bench to “catch the favorable moment,” as heyooexpressed it. Profound dejection clung about his soul like a heavy mist. Ayooprofound, intense dejection! He sat thinking, but could reach noyooconclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket chirped; it becameyooinsufferably close in the overheated room. He suddenly pictured theyoogarden, the path behind the garden, the door of his father’s houseyoomysteriously opening and Grushenka running in. He leapt up from the bench.yooyoo“It’s a tragedy!” he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he went up toyoothe sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean, middle-agedyoopeasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long, thin, reddishyoobeard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat, from the pocketyooof which peeped the chain of a silver watch. Mitya looked at his face withyoointense hatred, and for some unknown reason his curly hair particularlyyooirritated him.yooyooWhat was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things of suchyooimportance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly worn out, shouldyoowith business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on whom his wholeyoofate depended, while he snored as though there were nothing the matter, asyoothough he’d dropped from another planet.yooyoo“Oh, the irony of fate!” cried Mitya, and, quite losing his head, he fellyooagain to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him with a sort of ferocity,yoopulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but after five minutes of vainyooexertions, he returned to his bench in helpless despair, and sat down.yooyoo“Stupid! Stupid!” cried Mitya. “And how dishonorable it all is!” somethingyoomade him add. His head began to ache horribly. “Should he fling it up andyoogo away altogether?” he wondered. “No, wait till to-morrow now. I’ll stayyooon purpose. What else did I come for? Besides, I’ve no means of going. Howyooam I to get away from here now? Oh, the idiocy of it!”yooyooBut his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and unconsciouslyyoodozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to have slept for two hoursyooor more. He was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he couldyoohave screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of hisyoohead ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully andyoounderstand what had happened to him.yooyooAt last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from theyoostove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant stillyoolay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out,yooand ran staggering across the passage into the forester’s room. Theyooforester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full ofyoofumes, to Mitya’s surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strangeyoounconcern, though he did go to see to it.yooyoo“But he’s dead, he’s dead! and ... what am I to do then?” cried Mityayoofrantically.yooyooThey threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya broughtyooa pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then,yoofinding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it onyooLyagavy’s head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, andyoowhen he opened the window said grumpily:yooyoo“It’ll be all right, now.”yooyooHe went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya fussed aboutyoothe drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head, and gravelyyooresolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out that when he satyoodown for a moment to take breath, he closed his eyes, unconsciouslyyoostretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead.yooyooIt was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about nine o’clock.yooThe sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the hut. Theyoocurly-headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his coat on. He hadyooanother samovar and another bottle in front of him. Yesterday’s bottle hadyooalready been finished, and the new one was more than half empty. Mityayoojumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again,yoohopelessly and incurably. He stared at him for a moment with wide openedyooeyes. The peasant was silently and slyly watching him, with insultingyoocomposure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so Mityayoofancied. He rushed up to him.yooyoo“Excuse me, you see ... I ... you’ve most likely heard from the foresteryoohere in the hut. I’m Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son of the oldyooKaramazov whose copse you are buying.”yooyoo“That’s a lie!” said the peasant, calmly and confidently.yooyoo“A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?”yooyoo“I don’t know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,” said the peasant, speakingyoothickly.yooyoo“You’re bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do wake up, andyoocollect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here. You wrote toyooSamsonov, and he has sent me to you,” Mitya gasped breathlessly.yooyoo“You’re l-lying!” Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya’s legs went cold.yooyoo“For mercy’s sake! It isn’t a joke! You’re drunk, perhaps. Yet you canyoospeak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!”yooyoo“You’re a painter!”yooyoo“For mercy’s sake! I’m Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer toyoomake you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerningyoothe copse!”yooyooThe peasant stroked his beard importantly.yooyoo“No, you’ve contracted for the job and turned out a scamp. You’re ayooscoundrel!”yooyoo“I assure you you’re mistaken,” cried Mitya, wringing his hands inyoodespair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed up hisyooeyes cunningly.yooyoo“No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery. D’youyoohear? You’re a scoundrel! Do you understand that?”yooyooMitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly “something seemed to hit him onyoothe head,” as he said afterwards. In an instant a light seemed to dawn inyoohis mind, “a light was kindled and I grasped it all.” He stood, stupefied,yoowondering how he, after all a man of intelligence, could have yielded toyoosuch folly, have been led into such an adventure, and have kept it up foryooalmost twenty-four hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head.yooyoo“Why, the man’s drunk, dead drunk, and he’ll go on drinking now for ayooweek; what’s the use of waiting here? And what if Samsonov sent me here onyoopurpose? What if she—? Oh, God, what have I done?”yooyooThe peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya might haveyookilled the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a child. He wentyooquietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it on without a word, andyoowent out of the hut. He did not find the forester in the next room; thereyoowas no one there. He took fifty kopecks in small change out of his pocketyooand put them on the table for his night’s lodging, the candle, and theyootrouble he had given. Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest allyooround. He walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the hut,yooto the right or to the left. Hurrying there the evening before with theyoopriest, he had not noticed the road. He had no revengeful feeling foryooanybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He strode along a narrow forestyoopath, aimless, dazed, without heeding where he was going. A child couldyoohave knocked him down, so weak was he in body and soul. He got out of theyooforest somehow, however, and a vista of fields, bare after the harvest,yoostretched as far as the eye could see.yooyoo“What despair! What death all round!” he repeated, striding on and on.yooyooHe was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven acrossyoocountry in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya asked the way, and ityooturned out that the old merchant, too, was going to Volovya. After someyoodiscussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours later they arrived. AtyooVolovya, Mitya at once ordered posting-horses to drive to the town, andyoosuddenly realized that he was appallingly hungry. While the horses wereyoobeing harnessed, an omelette was prepared for him. He ate it all in anyooinstant, ate a huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed threeyooglasses of vodka. After eating, his spirits and his heart grew lighter. Heyooflew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new andyoo“unalterable” plan to procure that “accursed money” before evening. “Andyooto think, only to think that a man’s life should be ruined for the sake ofyoothat paltry three thousand!” he cried, contemptuously. “I’ll settle ityooto-day.” And if it had not been for the thought of Grushenka and of whatyoomight have happened to her, which never left him, he would perhaps haveyoobecome quite cheerful again.... But the thought of her was stabbing him toyoothe heart every moment, like a sharp knife.yooyooAt last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka.yooyooyooyooChapter III. Gold-MinesyooyooyooThis was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to Rakitin withyoosuch horror. She was just then expecting the “message,” and was muchyoorelieved that Mitya had not been to see her that day or the day before.yooShe hoped that “please God he won’t come till I’m gone away,” and heyoosuddenly burst in on her. The rest we know already. To get him off heryoohands she suggested at once that he should walk with her to Samsonov’s,yoowhere she said she absolutely must go “to settle his accounts,” and whenyooMitya accompanied her at once, she said good-by to him at the gate, makingyoohim promise to come at twelve o’clock to take her home again. Mitya, too,yoowas delighted at this arrangement. If she was sitting at Samsonov’s sheyoocould not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, “if only she’s not lying,” heyooadded at once. But he thought she was not lying from what he saw.yooyooHe was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved woman,yooat once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be happening toyooher, and how she may be betraying him, but, when shaken, heartbroken,yooconvinced of her faithlessness, he runs back to her; at the first glanceyooat her face, her gay, laughing, affectionate face, he revives at once,yoolays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses himself for hisyoojealousy.yooyooAfter leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he had so muchyoostill to do that day! But a load had been lifted from his heart, anyway.yooyoo“Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov whether anythingyoohappened there last night, whether, by any chance, she went to FyodoryooPavlovitch; ough!” floated through his mind.yooyooBefore he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up again inyoohis restless heart.yooyooJealousy! “Othello was not jealous, he was trustful,” observed Pushkin.yooAnd that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our greatyoopoet. Othello’s soul was shattered and his whole outlook clouded simplyyoobecause _his ideal was destroyed_. But Othello did not begin hiding,yoospying, peeping. He was trustful, on the contrary. He had to be led up,yoopushed on, excited with great difficulty before he could entertain theyooidea of deceit. The truly jealous man is not like that. It is impossibleyooto picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealousyooman can descend without a qualm of conscience. And yet it’s not as thoughyoothe jealous were all vulgar and base souls. On the contrary, a man ofyoolofty feelings, whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice, may yetyoohide under tables, bribe the vilest people, and be familiar with theyoolowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.yooyooOthello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness—not incapableyooof forgiving it, but of making up his mind to it—though his soul was asyooinnocent and free from malice as a babe’s. It is not so with the reallyyoojealous man. It is hard to imagine what some jealous men can make up theiryoomind to and overlook, and what they can forgive! The jealous are theyooreadiest of all to forgive, and all women know it. The jealous man canyooforgive extraordinarily quickly (though, of course, after a violentyooscene), and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved,yoothe very kisses and embraces he has seen, if only he can somehow beyooconvinced that it has all been “for the last time,” and that his rivalyoowill vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of the earth,yooor that he himself will carry her away somewhere, where that dreaded rivalyoowill not get near her. Of course the reconciliation is only for an hour.yooFor, even if the rival did disappear next day, he would invent another oneyooand would be jealous of him. And one might wonder what there was in a loveyoothat had to be so watched over, what a love could be worth that neededyoosuch strenuous guarding. But that the jealous will never understand. Andyooyet among them are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that thoseyoovery men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening andyoospying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment, anyway, thoughyoothey understand clearly enough with their “noble hearts” the shamefulyoodepths to which they have voluntarily sunk.yooyooAt the sight of Grushenka, Mitya’s jealousy vanished, and, for an instantyoohe became trustful and generous, and positively despised himself for hisyooevil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love for the woman, thereyoowas an element of something far higher than he himself imagined, that ityoowas not only a sensual passion, not only the “curve of her body,” of whichyoohe had talked to Alyosha. But, as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya beganyooto suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt noyoosting of conscience at it.yooyooAnd so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to makeyoohaste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small,yootemporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all gone on hisyooexpedition. And, as we all know, one can’t take a step without money. Butyoohe had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan. He had a braceyooof fine dueling pistols in a case, which he had not pawned till thenyoobecause he prized them above all his possessions.yooyooIn the “Metropolis” tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with ayooyoung official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor wasyoopassionately fond of weapons. He used to buy pistols, revolvers, daggers,yoohang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances. He prided himself onyoothem, and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya,yoowithout stopping to think, went straight to him, and offered to pawn hisyoopistols to him for ten roubles. The official, delighted, began trying toyoopersuade him to sell them outright. But Mitya would not consent, so theyooyoung man gave him ten roubles, protesting that nothing would induce himyooto take interest. They parted friends.yooyooMitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch’s by the back way,yooto his arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as possible. In this wayyoothe fact was established that three or four hours before a certain event,yooof which I shall speak later on, Mitya had not a farthing, and pawned foryooten roubles a possession he valued, though, three hours later, he was inyoopossession of thousands.... But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevnayoo(the woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitch’s) he learned the very disturbingyoofact of Smerdyakov’s illness. He heard the story of his fall in theyoocellar, his fit, the doctor’s visit, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s anxiety; he heardyoowith interest, too, that his brother Ivan had set off that morning foryooMoscow.yooyoo“Then he must have driven through Volovya before me,” thought Dmitri, butyoohe was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. “What will happen now? Who’llyookeep watch for me? Who’ll bring me word?” he thought. He began greedilyyooquestioning the women whether they had seen anything the evening before.yooThey quite understood what he was trying to find out, and completelyyooreassured him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been there theyoonight; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya grew thoughtful. Heyoowould certainly have to keep watch to-day, but where? Here or atyooSamsonov’s gate? He decided that he must be on the look out both here andyoothere, and meanwhile ... meanwhile.... The difficulty was that he had toyoocarry out the new plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sureyooof its success, but he must not delay acting upon it. Mitya resolved toyoosacrifice an hour to it: “In an hour I shall know everything, I shallyoosettle everything, and then, then, first of all to Samsonov’s. I’llyooinquire whether Grushenka’s there and instantly be back here again, stayyootill eleven, and then to Samsonov’s again to bring her home.” This wasyoowhat he decided.yooyooHe flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes, dressed, andyoowent to Madame Hohlakov’s. Alas! he had built his hopes on her. He hadyooresolved to borrow three thousand from that lady. And what was more, heyoofelt suddenly convinced that she would not refuse to lend it to him. Ityoomay be wondered why, if he felt so certain, he had not gone to her atyoofirst, one of his own sort, so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man heyoodid not know, who was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew howyooto speak.yooyooBut the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and hadyooseen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew she could notyooendure him. She had detested him from the first because he was engaged toyooKaterina Ivanovna, while she had, for some reason, suddenly conceived theyoodesire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over, and marry theyoo“charming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.”yooMitya’s manners she detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and hadyooonce said about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she wasyoouncultivated. But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struckyoohim: “If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna” (and heyooknew she was positively hysterical upon the subject) “why should sheyoorefuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me to leave Katya andyooget away from her for ever. These spoilt fine ladies, if they set theiryoohearts on anything, will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice.yooBesides, she’s so rich,” Mitya argued.yooyooAs for his “plan” it was just the same as before; it consisted of theyoooffer of his rights to Tchermashnya—but not with a commercial object, asyooit had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady with theyoopossibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand—but simply as ayoosecurity for the debt. As he worked out this new idea, Mitya was enchantedyoowith it, but so it always was with him in all his undertakings, in all hisyoosudden decisions. He gave himself up to every new idea with passionateyooenthusiasm. Yet, when he mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakov’s house heyoofelt a shiver of fear run down his spine. At that moment he saw fully, asyooa mathematical certainty, that this was his last hope, that if this brokeyoodown, nothing else was left him in the world, but to “rob and murder someyooone for the three thousand.” It was half-past seven when he rang at theyoobell.yooyooAt first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was announced heyoowas received with extraordinary rapidity. “As though she were waiting foryoome,” thought Mitya, and as soon as he had been led to the drawing-room,yoothe lady of the house herself ran in, and declared at once that she wasyooexpecting him.yooyoo“I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I’d no reason to supposeyooyou would come to see me, as you will admit yourself. Yet, I did expectyooyou. You may marvel at my instinct, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but I wasyooconvinced all the morning that you would come.”yooyoo“That is certainly wonderful, madam,” observed Mitya, sitting down limply,yoo“but I have come to you on a matter of great importance.... On a matter ofyoosupreme importance for me, that is, madam ... for me alone ... and Iyoohasten—”yooyoo“I know you’ve come on most important business, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; it’syoonot a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking back to the miraculousyoo(have you heard about Father Zossima?). This is a case of mathematics: youyoocouldn’t help coming, after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna;yooyou couldn’t, you couldn’t, that’s a mathematical certainty.”yooyoo“The realism of actual life, madam, that’s what it is. But allow me toyooexplain—”yooyoo“Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I’m all for realism now. I’ve seenyootoo much of miracles. You’ve heard that Father Zossima is dead?”yooyoo“No, madam, it’s the first time I’ve heard of it.” Mitya was a littleyoosurprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.yooyoo“Last night, and only imagine—”yooyoo“Madam,” said Mitya, “I can imagine nothing except that I’m in a desperateyooposition, and that if you don’t help me, everything will come to grief,yooand I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality of the expression, butyooI’m in a fever—”yooyoo“I know, I know that you’re in a fever. You could hardly fail to be, andyoowhatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have long been thinkingyooover your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching over it and studyingyooit.... Oh, believe me, I’m an experienced doctor of the soul, DmitriyooFyodorovitch.”yooyoo“Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I’m certainly an experiencedyoopatient,” said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, “and I feel that if youyooare watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help in myyooruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with which Iyoohave ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you.... I haveyoocome, madam—”yooyoo“Don’t explain it. It’s of secondary importance. But as for help, you’reyoonot the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have most likelyyooheard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband was ruined, ‘had come toyoogrief,’ as you characteristically express it, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Iyoorecommended him to take to horse-breeding, and now he’s doing well. Haveyooyou any idea of horse-breeding, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”yooyoo“Not the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!” cried Mitya, inyoonervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. “I simply imploreyooyou, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two minutes of free speech thatyooI may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with which I haveyoocome. Besides, I am short of time. I’m in a fearful hurry,” Mitya criedyoohysterically, feeling that she was just going to begin talking again, andyoohoping to cut her short. “I have come in despair ... in the last gasp ofyoodespair, to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but onyoosafe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees!yooOnly let me explain—”yooyoo“You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!” Madame Hohlakov with ayoogesture demanded silence in her turn, “and whatever you may tell me, Iyooknow it all beforehand; I’ve told you so already. You ask for a certainyoosum, for three thousand, but I can give you more, immeasurably more, Iyoowill save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me.”yooyooMitya started from his seat again.yooyoo“Madam, will you really be so good!” he cried, with strong feeling. “GoodyooGod, you’ve saved me! You have saved a man from a violent death, from ayoobullet.... My eternal gratitude—”yooyoo“I will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!” cried MadameyooHohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya’s ecstasy.yooyoo“Infinitely? But I don’t need so much. I only need that fatal threeyoothousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum with infiniteyoogratitude, and I propose a plan which—”yooyoo“Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it’s said and done.” Madame Hohlakov cut himyooshort, with the modest triumph of beneficence: “I have promised to saveyooyou, and I will save you. I will save you as I did Belmesov. What do youyoothink of the gold-mines, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”yooyoo“Of the gold-mines, madam? I have never thought anything about them.”yooyoo“But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over and over again.yooI have been watching you for the last month. I’ve watched you a hundredyootimes as you’ve walked past, saying to myself: That’s a man of energy whoyooought to be at the gold-mines. I’ve studied your gait and come to theyooconclusion: that’s a man who would find gold.”yooyoo“From my gait, madam?” said Mitya, smiling.yooyoo“Yes, from your gait. You surely don’t deny that character can be toldyoofrom the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the idea. I’m all foryooscience and realism now. After all this business with Father Zossima,yoowhich has so upset me, from this very day I’m a realist and I want toyoodevote myself to practical usefulness. I’m cured. ‘Enough!’ as Turgenevyoosays.”yooyoo“But, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me—”yooyoo“It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Madame Hohlakov cut in at once. “Theyoomoney is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three million,yooDmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. I’ll make you a present of theyooidea: you shall find gold-mines, make millions, return and become ayooleading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things. Are we to leaveyooit all to the Jews? You will found institutions and enterprises of allyoosorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age ofyoorailways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You’ll become famous and indispensable toyoothe Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. Theyoodepreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch;yoopeople don’t know that side of me—”yooyoo“Madam, madam!” Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment. “I shallyooindeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam.... I shallyooperhaps set off ... to the gold-mines.... I’ll come and see you againyooabout it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand you soyoogenerously ... oh, that would set me free, and if you could to-day ... youyoosee, I haven’t a minute, a minute to lose to-day—”yooyoo“Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!” Madame Hohlakov interruptedyooemphatically. “The question is, will you go to the gold-mines or not; haveyooyou quite made up your mind? Answer yes or no.”yooyoo“I will go, madam, afterwards.... I’ll go where you like ... but now—”yooyoo“Wait!” cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running to a handsomeyoobureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling out one draweryooafter another, looking for something with desperate haste.yooyoo“The three thousand,” thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping, “and atyoothe instant ... without any papers or formalities ... that’s doing thingsyooin gentlemanly style! She’s a splendid woman, if only she didn’t talk soyoomuch!”yooyoo“Here!” cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya, “here isyoowhat I was looking for!”yooyooIt was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next theyooskin with a cross.yooyoo“This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” she went on reverently, “fromyoothe relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put it on your neck myself,yooand with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new career.”yooyooAnd she actually put the cord round his neck, and began arranging it. Inyooextreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped her, and at last he gotyooit under his neck-tie and collar through his shirt to his chest.yooyoo“Now you can set off,” Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting downyootriumphantly in her place again.yooyoo“Madam, I am so touched. I don’t know how to thank you, indeed ... foryoosuch kindness, but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me....yooThat sum of money, for which I shall be indebted to your generosity....yooOh, madam, since you are so kind, so touchingly generous to me,” Mityayooexclaimed impulsively, “then let me reveal to you ... though, of course,yooyou’ve known it a long time ... that I love somebody here.... I have beenyoofalse to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh, I’ve behavedyooinhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here with another womanyoo... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise, for you know everythingyooalready, but whom I cannot leave on any account, and therefore that threeyoothousand now—”yooyoo“Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Madame Hohlakov interrupted inyoothe most decisive tone. “Leave everything, especially women. Gold-minesyooare your goal, and there’s no place for women there. Afterwards, when youyoocome back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in theyoohighest society. That will be a modern girl, a girl of education andyooadvanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have gainedyooground, and the new woman will have appeared.”yooyoo“Madam, that’s not the point, not at all....” Mitya clasped his hands inyooentreaty.yooyoo“Yes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thingyooyou’re yearning for, though you don’t realize it yourself. I am not at allyooopposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Theyoodevelopment of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in theyoonear future—that’s my ideal. I’ve a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,yoopeople don’t know that side of me. I wrote a letter to the author,yooShtchedrin, on that subject. He has taught me so much, so much about theyoovocation of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous letter of twoyoolines: ‘I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman.yooPersevere.’ And I signed myself, ‘A Mother.’ I thought of signing myselfyoo‘A contemporary Mother,’ and hesitated, but I stuck to the simpleyoo‘Mother’; there’s more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. And theyooword ‘contemporary’ might have reminded him of ‘_The Contemporary_’—ayoopainful recollection owing to the censorship.... Good Heavens, what is theyoomatter!”yooyoo“Madam!” cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands before her inyoohelpless entreaty. “You will make me weep if you delay what you have soyoogenerously—”yooyoo“Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! That’s a noble feeling ...yoosuch a path lies open before you! Tears will ease your heart, and later onyooyou will return rejoicing. You will hasten to me from Siberia on purposeyooto share your joy with me—”yooyoo“But allow me, too!” Mitya cried suddenly. “For the last time I entreatyooyou, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to-day, if not, when mayyooI come for it?”yooyoo“What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”yooyoo“The three thousand you promised me ... that you so generously—”yooyoo“Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven’t got three thousand,” MadameyooHohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya was stupefied.yooyoo“Why, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as good as in myyoohands—”yooyoo“Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that case youyoomisunderstood me. I was talking of the gold-mines. It’s true I promisedyooyou more, infinitely more than three thousand, I remember it all now, butyooI was referring to the gold-mines.”yooyoo“But the money? The three thousand?” Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.yooyoo“Oh, if you meant money, I haven’t any. I haven’t a penny, DmitriyooFyodorovitch. I’m quarreling with my steward about it, and I’ve justyooborrowed five hundred roubles from Miüsov, myself. No, no, I’ve no money.yooAnd, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, if I had, I wouldn’t give it toyooyou. In the first place I never lend money. Lending money means losingyoofriends. And I wouldn’t give it to you particularly. I wouldn’t give ityooyou, because I like you and want to save you, for all you need is theyoogold-mines, the gold-mines, the gold-mines!”yooyoo“Oh, the devil!” roared Mitya, and with all his might brought his fistyoodown on the table.yooyoo“Aie! Aie!” cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew to the other endyooof the drawing-room.yooyooMitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out of theyoohouse, into the street, into the darkness! He walked like one possessed,yooand beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he had struck himselfyootwo days previously, before Alyosha, the last time he saw him in the dark,yooon the road. What those blows upon his breast signified, _on that spot_,yooand what he meant by it—that was, for the time, a secret which was knownyooto no one in the world, and had not been told even to Alyosha. But thatyoosecret meant for him more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide. So he hadyoodetermined, if he did not get hold of the three thousand that would payyoohis debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his breast, from _thatyoospot on his breast_, the shame he carried upon it, that weighed on hisyooconscience. All this will be fully explained to the reader later on, butyoonow that his last hope had vanished, this man, so strong in appearance,yooburst out crying like a little child a few steps from the Hohlakovs’yoohouse. He walked on, and not knowing what he was doing, wiped away hisyootears with his fist. In this way he reached the square, and suddenlyyoobecame aware that he had stumbled against something. He heard a piercingyoowail from an old woman whom he had almost knocked down.yooyoo“Good Lord, you’ve nearly killed me! Why don’t you look where you’reyoogoing, scapegrace?”yooyoo“Why, it’s you!” cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the dark. Ityoowas the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom Mitya had particularlyyoonoticed the day before.yooyoo“And who are you, my good sir?” said the old woman, in quite a differentyoovoice. “I don’t know you in the dark.”yooyoo“You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch’s. You’re the servant there?”yooyoo“Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch’s.... But I don’t knowyooyou now.”yooyoo“Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?” said Mitya,yoobeside himself with suspense. “I saw her to the house some time ago.”yooyoo“She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went off again.”yooyoo“What? Went away?” cried Mitya. “When did she go?”yooyoo“Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only told KuzmayooKuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she ran away.”yooyoo“You’re lying, damn you!” roared Mitya.yooyoo“Aie! Aie!” shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.yooyooHe ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At theyoomoment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It was not moreyoothan a quarter of an hour after her departure.yooyooFenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona, in theyookitchen when “the captain” ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing shriek onyooseeing him.yooyoo“You scream?” roared Mitya, “where is she?”yooyooBut without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a word, he fellyooall of a heap at her feet.yooyoo“Fenya, for Christ’s sake, tell me, where is she?”yooyoo“I don’t know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don’t know. You may kill meyoobut I can’t tell you.” Fenya swore and protested. “You went out with heryooyourself not long ago—”yooyoo“She came back!”yooyoo“Indeed she didn’t. By God I swear she didn’t come back.”yooyoo“You’re lying!” shouted Mitya. “From your terror I know where she is.”yooyooHe rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so easily.yooBut she knew very well that it was only that he was in such haste, or sheyoomight not have fared so well. But as he ran, he surprised both Fenya andyooold Matryona by an unexpected action. On the table stood a brass mortar,yoowith a pestle in it, a small brass pestle, not much more than six inchesyoolong. Mitya already had opened the door with one hand when, with theyooother, he snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his side-pocket.yooyoo“Oh, Lord! He’s going to murder some one!” cried Fenya, flinging up heryoohands.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. In The DarkyooyooyooWhere was he running? “Where could she be except at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s?yooShe must have run straight to him from Samsonov’s, that was clear now. Theyoowhole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.” ... It all rushed whirlingyoothrough his mind. He did not run to Marya Kondratyevna’s. “There was noyooneed to go there ... not the slightest need ... he must raise no alarm ...yoothey would run and tell directly.... Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in theyooplot, Smerdyakov too, he too, all had been bought over!”yooyooHe formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round FyodoryooPavlovitch’s house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky Street,yoothen over the little bridge, and so came straight to the deserted alley atyoothe back, which was empty and uninhabited, with, on one side the hurdleyoofence of a neighbor’s kitchen-garden, on the other the strong high fence,yoothat ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitch’s garden. Here he chose a spot,yooapparently the very place, where according to the tradition, he knewyooLizaveta had once climbed over it: “If she could climb over it,” theyoothought, God knows why, occurred to him, “surely I can.” He did in factyoojump up, and instantly contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence.yooThen he vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it. Close by, inyoothe garden stood the bath-house, but from the fence he could see theyoolighted windows of the house too.yooyoo“Yes, the old man’s bedroom is lighted up. She’s there!” and he leapt fromyoothe fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory was ill and very likelyyooSmerdyakov, too, and that there was no one to hear him, he instinctivelyyoohid himself, stood still, and began to listen. But there was dead silenceyooon all sides and, as though of design, complete stillness, not theyooslightest breath of wind.yooyoo“And naught but the whispering silence,” the line for some reason rose toyoohis mind. “If only no one heard me jump over the fence! I think not.”yooStanding still for a minute, he walked softly over the grass in theyoogarden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He walked slowly, creepingyoostealthily at every step, listening to his own footsteps. It took him fiveyoominutes to reach the lighted window. He remembered that just under theyoowindow there were several thick and high bushes of elder and whitebeam.yooThe door from the house into the garden on the left-hand side, was shut;yoohe had carefully looked on purpose to see, in passing. At last he reachedyoothe bushes and hid behind them. He held his breath. “I must wait now,” heyoothought, “to reassure them, in case they heard my footsteps and areyoolistening ... if only I don’t cough or sneeze.”yooyooHe waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at moments,yoohe could scarcely breathe. “No, this throbbing at my heart won’t stop,” heyoothought. “I can’t wait any longer.” He was standing behind a bush in theyooshadow. The light of the window fell on the front part of the bush.yooyoo“How red the whitebeam berries are!” he murmured, not knowing why. Softlyyooand noiselessly, step by step, he approached the window, and raisedyoohimself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch’s bedroom lay open before him. Ityoowas not a large room, and was divided in two parts by a red screen,yoo“Chinese,” as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to call it. The word “Chinese”yooflashed into Mitya’s mind, “and behind the screen, is Grushenka,” thoughtyooMitya. He began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was wearing his newyoostriped-silk dressing-gown, which Mitya had never seen, and a silk cordyoowith tassels round the waist. A clean, dandified shirt of fine linen withyoogold studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing-gown. On his headyooFyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage which Alyosha had seen.yooyoo“He has got himself up,” thought Mitya.yooyooHis father was standing near the window, apparently lost in thought.yooSuddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment, and hearing nothingyoowent up to the table, poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanteryooand drank it off. Then he uttered a deep sigh, again stood still a moment,yoowalked carelessly up to the looking-glass on the wall, with his right handyooraised the red bandage on his forehead a little, and began examining hisyoobruises and scars, which had not yet disappeared.yooyoo“He’s alone,” thought Mitya, “in all probability he’s alone.”yooyooFyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned suddenly toyoothe window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow.yooyoo“She may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she’s asleep by now,” heyoothought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from theyoowindow. “He’s looking for her out of the window, so she’s not there. Whyyooshould he stare out into the dark? He’s wild with impatience.” ... Mityayooslipped back at once, and fell to gazing in at the window again. The oldyooman was sitting down at the table, apparently disappointed. At last he putyoohis elbow on the table, and laid his right cheek against his hand. Mityayoowatched him eagerly.yooyoo“He’s alone, he’s alone!” he repeated again. “If she were here, his faceyoowould be different.”yooyooStrange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart that sheyoowas not here. “It’s not that she’s not here,” he explained to himself,yooimmediately, “but that I can’t tell for certain whether she is or not.”yooMitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment exceptionallyyooclear, that he took in everything to the slightest detail, and missed noyoopoint. But a feeling of misery, the misery of uncertainty and indecision,yoowas growing in his heart with every instant. “Is she here or not?” Theyooangry doubt filled his heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he put outyoohis hand and softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked the signal theyooold man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then three timesyoomore quickly, the signal that meant “Grushenka is here!”yooyooThe old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up quickly, ran toyoothe window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow. Fyodor Pavlovitch openedyoothe window and thrust his whole head out.yooyoo“Grushenka, is it you? Is it you?” he said, in a sort of tremblingyoohalf-whisper. “Where are you, my angel, where are you?” He was fearfullyyooagitated and breathless.yooyoo“He’s alone.” Mitya decided.yooyoo“Where are you?” cried the old man again; and he thrust his head outyoofarther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all directions, rightyooand left. “Come here, I’ve a little present for you. Come, I’ll showyooyou....”yooyoo“He means the three thousand,” thought Mitya.yooyoo“But where are you? Are you at the door? I’ll open it directly.”yooyooAnd the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out to theyooright, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see into theyoodarkness. In another second he would certainly have run out to open theyoodoor without waiting for Grushenka’s answer.yooyooMitya looked at him from the side without stirring. The old man’s profileyoothat he loathed so, his pendent Adam’s apple, his hooked nose, his lipsyoothat smiled in greedy expectation, were all brightly lighted up by theyooslanting lamplight falling on the left from the room. A horrible fury ofyoohatred suddenly surged up in Mitya’s heart: “There he was, his rival, theyooman who had tormented him, had ruined his life!” It was a rush of thatyoosudden, furious, revengeful anger of which he had spoken, as thoughyooforeseeing it, to Alyosha, four days ago in the arbor, when, in answer toyooAlyosha’s question, “How can you say you’ll kill our father?” “I don’tyooknow, I don’t know,” he had said then. “Perhaps I shall not kill him,yooperhaps I shall. I’m afraid he’ll suddenly be so loathsome to me at thatyoomoment. I hate his double chin, his nose, his eyes, his shameless grin. Iyoofeel a personal repulsion. That’s what I’m afraid of, that’s what may beyootoo much for me.” ... This personal repulsion was growing unendurable.yooMitya was beside himself, he suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of hisyoopocket.yooyoo                  -------------------------------------yooyoo“God was watching over me then,” Mitya himself said afterwards. At thatyoovery moment Grigory waked up on his bed of sickness. Earlier in theyooevening he had undergone the treatment which Smerdyakov had described toyooIvan. He had rubbed himself all over with vodka mixed with a secret, veryyoostrong decoction, had drunk what was left of the mixture while his wifeyoorepeated a “certain prayer” over him, after which he had gone to bed.yooMarfa Ignatyevna had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to strongyoodrink, slept like the dead beside her husband.yooyooBut Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a moment’syooreflection, though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his back, he sat upyooin bed. Then he deliberated again, got up and dressed hurriedly. Perhapsyoohis conscience was uneasy at the thought of sleeping while the house wasyoounguarded “in such perilous times.” Smerdyakov, exhausted by his fit, layyoomotionless in the next room. Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir. “The stuff’syoobeen too much for the woman,” Grigory thought, glancing at her, andyoogroaning, he went out on the steps. No doubt he only intended to look outyoofrom the steps, for he was hardly able to walk, the pain in his back andyoohis right leg was intolerable. But he suddenly remembered that he had notyoolocked the little gate into the garden that evening. He was the mostyoopunctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an unchangeable routine,yooand habits that lasted for years. Limping and writhing with pain he wentyoodown the steps and towards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open.yooMechanically he stepped into the garden. Perhaps he fancied something,yooperhaps caught some sound, and, glancing to the left he saw his master’syoowindow open. No one was looking out of it then.yooyoo“What’s it open for? It’s not summer now,” thought Grigory, and suddenly,yooat that very instant he caught a glimpse of something extraordinary beforeyoohim in the garden. Forty paces in front of him a man seemed to be runningyooin the dark, a sort of shadow was moving very fast.yooyoo“Good Lord!” cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the pain in hisyooback, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He took a short cut,yooevidently he knew the garden better; the flying figure went towards theyoobath-house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence. Grigoryyoofollowed, not losing sight of him, and ran, forgetting everything. Heyooreached the fence at the very moment the man was climbing over it. Grigoryyoocried out, beside himself, pounced on him, and clutched his leg in his twoyoohands.yooyooYes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him, it was he,yoothe “monster,” the “parricide.”yooyoo“Parricide!” the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood couldyoohear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as though struckyooby lightning.yooyooMitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man. In Mitya’syoohands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in the grass. Theyoopestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on the path, in ayoomost conspicuous place. For some seconds he examined the prostrate figureyoobefore him. The old man’s head was covered with blood. Mitya put out hisyoohand and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly, that he hadyoobeen awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old man’syooskull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was flowingyoohorribly; and in a moment Mitya’s fingers were drenched with the hotyoostream. He remembered taking out of his pocket the clean whiteyoohandkerchief with which he had provided himself for his visit to MadameyooHohlakov, and putting it to the old man’s head, senselessly trying to wipeyoothe blood from his face and temples. But the handkerchief was instantlyyoosoaked with blood.yooyoo“Good heavens! what am I doing it for?” thought Mitya, suddenly pullingyoohimself together. “If I have broken his skull, how can I find out now? Andyoowhat difference does it make now?” he added, hopelessly. “If I’ve killedyoohim, I’ve killed him.... You’ve come to grief, old man, so there you mustyoolie!” he said aloud. And suddenly turning to the fence, he vaulted over ityoointo the lane and fell to running—the handkerchief soaked with blood heyooheld, crushed up in his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it into theyooback pocket of his coat. He ran headlong, and the few passers-by who metyoohim in the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they had met ayooman running that night. He flew back again to the widow Morozov’s house.yooyooImmediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed to theyoochief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for Christ’s sake, “notyooto let the captain in again to-day or to-morrow.” Nazar Ivanovitchyoopromised, but went upstairs to his mistress who had suddenly sent for him,yooand meeting his nephew, a boy of twenty, who had recently come from theyoocountry, on the way up told him to take his place, but forgot to mentionyoo“the captain.” Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked. The lad instantlyyoorecognized him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him. Opening the gateyooat once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him with a good-humoredyoosmile that “Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now, you know.”yooyoo“Where is she then, Prohor?” asked Mitya, stopping short.yooyoo“She set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to Mokroe.”yooyoo“What for?” cried Mitya.yooyoo“That I can’t say. To see some officer. Some one invited her and horsesyoowere sent to fetch her.”yooyooMitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya.yooyooyooyooChapter V. A Sudden ResolutionyooyooyooShe was sitting in the kitchen with her grandmother; they were both justyoogoing to bed. Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had not locked themselvesyooin. Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and seized her by the throat.yooyoo“Speak at once! Where is she? With whom is she now, at Mokroe?” he roaredyoofuriously.yooyooBoth the women squealed.yooyoo“Aie! I’ll tell you. Aie! Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, I’ll tell youyooeverything directly, I won’t hide anything,” gabbled Fenya, frightened toyoodeath; “she’s gone to Mokroe, to her officer.”yooyoo“What officer?” roared Mitya.yooyoo“To her officer, the same one she used to know, the one who threw her overyoofive years ago,” cackled Fenya, as fast as she could speak.yooyooMitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her throat. He stoodyoofacing her, pale as death, unable to utter a word, but his eyes showedyoothat he realized it all, all, from the first word, and guessed the wholeyooposition. Poor Fenya was not in a condition at that moment to observeyoowhether he understood or not. She remained sitting on the trunk as she hadyoobeen when he ran into the room, trembling all over, holding her hands outyoobefore her as though trying to defend herself. She seemed to have grownyoorigid in that position. Her wide-opened, scared eyes were fixed immovablyyooupon him. And to make matters worse, both his hands were smeared withyooblood. On the way, as he ran, he must have touched his forehead with them,yoowiping off the perspiration, so that on his forehead and his right cheekyoowere blood-stained patches. Fenya was on the verge of hysterics. The oldyoocook had jumped up and was staring at him like a mad woman, almostyoounconscious with terror.yooyooMitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair next toyooFenya. He sat, not reflecting but, as it were, terror-stricken, benumbed.yooYet everything was clear as day: that officer, he knew about him, he knewyooeverything perfectly, he had known it from Grushenka herself, had knownyoothat a letter had come from him a month before. So that for a month, for ayoowhole month, this had been going on, a secret from him, till the veryyooarrival of this new man, and he had never thought of him! But how couldyoohe, how could he not have thought of him? Why was it he had forgotten thisyooofficer, like that, forgotten him as soon as he heard of him? That was theyooquestion that faced him like some monstrous thing. And he looked at thisyoomonstrous thing with horror, growing cold with horror.yooyooBut suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate child, heyoobegan speaking to Fenya as though he had utterly forgotten how he hadyooscared and hurt her just now. He fell to questioning Fenya with an extremeyoopreciseness, astonishing in his position, and though the girl lookedyoowildly at his blood-stained hands, she, too, with wonderful readiness andyoorapidity, answered every question as though eager to put the whole truthyooand nothing but the truth before him. Little by little, even with a sortyooof enjoyment, she began explaining every detail, not wanting to tormentyoohim, but, as it were, eager to be of the utmost service to him. Sheyoodescribed the whole of that day, in great detail, the visit of Rakitin andyooAlyosha, how she, Fenya, had stood on the watch, how the mistress had setyoooff, and how she had called out of the window to Alyosha to give him,yooMitya, her greetings, and to tell him “to remember for ever how she hadyooloved him for an hour.”yooyooHearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was a flush ofyoocolor on his pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said to him, not a bityooafraid now to be inquisitive:yooyoo“Look at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They’re all over blood!”yooyoo“Yes,” answered Mitya mechanically. He looked carelessly at his hands andyooat once forgot them and Fenya’s question.yooyooHe sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since he had run in.yooHis first horror was over, but evidently some new fixed determination hadyootaken possession of him. He suddenly stood up, smiling dreamily.yooyoo“What has happened to you, sir?” said Fenya, pointing to his hands again.yooShe spoke compassionately, as though she felt very near to him now in hisyoogrief. Mitya looked at his hands again.yooyoo“That’s blood, Fenya,” he said, looking at her with a strange expression.yoo“That’s human blood, and my God! why was it shed? But ... Fenya ...yoothere’s a fence here” (he looked at her as though setting her a riddle),yoo“a high fence, and terrible to look at. But at dawn to-morrow, when theyoosun rises, Mitya will leap over that fence.... You don’t understand whatyoofence, Fenya, and, never mind.... You’ll hear to-morrow and understand ...yooand now, good-by. I won’t stand in her way. I’ll step aside, I know how toyoostep aside. Live, my joy.... You loved me for an hour, remember MityenkayooKaramazov so for ever.... She always used to call me Mityenka, do youyooremember?”yooyooAnd with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen. Fenya was almostyoomore frightened at this sudden departure than she had been when he ran inyooand attacked her.yooyooJust ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, the youngyooofficial with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was by now half-pastyooeight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening tea, and had just putyoohis coat on again to go to the “Metropolis” to play billiards. Mityayoocaught him coming out.yooyooSeeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young man uttered ayoocry of surprise.yooyoo“Good heavens! What is the matter?”yooyoo“I’ve come for my pistols,” said Mitya, “and brought you the money. Andyoothanks very much. I’m in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please make haste.”yooyooPyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught sight of ayoobundle of bank-notes in Mitya’s hand, and what was more, he had walked inyooholding the notes as no one walks in and no one carries money: he had themyooin his right hand, and held them outstretched as if to show them.yooPerhotin’s servant-boy, who met Mitya in the passage, said afterwards thatyoohe walked into the passage in the same way, with the money outstretched inyoohis hand, so he must have been carrying them like that even in theyoostreets. They were all rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes, and theyoofingers holding them were covered with blood.yooyooWhen Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of money, he saidyoothat it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that it might have beenyootwo thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a big, “fat” bundle. “DmitriyooFyodorovitch,” so he testified afterwards, “seemed unlike himself, too;yoonot drunk, but, as it were, exalted, lost to everything, but at the sameyootime, as it were, absorbed, as though pondering and searching foryoosomething and unable to come to a decision. He was in great haste,yooanswered abruptly and very strangely, and at moments seemed not at allyoodejected but quite cheerful.”yooyoo“But what _is_ the matter with you? What’s wrong?” cried Pyotr Ilyitch,yoolooking wildly at his guest. “How is it that you’re all covered withyooblood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!”yooyooHe took him by the elbow and led him to the glass.yooyooSeeing his blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled wrathfully.yooyoo“Damnation! That’s the last straw,” he muttered angrily, hurriedlyyoochanging the notes from his right hand to the left, and impulsively jerkedyoothe handkerchief out of his pocket. But the handkerchief turned out to beyoosoaked with blood, too (it was the handkerchief he had used to wipeyooGrigory’s face). There was scarcely a white spot on it, and it had notyoomerely begun to dry, but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could notyoobe pulled apart. Mitya threw it angrily on the floor.yooyoo“Oh, damn it!” he said. “Haven’t you a rag of some sort ... to wipe myyooface?”yooyoo“So you’re only stained, not wounded? You’d better wash,” said PyotryooIlyitch. “Here’s a wash-stand. I’ll pour you out some water.”yooyoo“A wash-stand? That’s all right ... but where am I to put this?”yooyooWith the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of hundred-roubleyoonotes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as though it were for him toyoodecide what he, Mitya, was to do with his own money.yooyoo“In your pocket, or on the table here. They won’t be lost.”yooyoo“In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right.... But, I say, that’s allyoononsense,” he cried, as though suddenly coming out of his absorption.yoo“Look here, let’s first settle that business of the pistols. Give themyooback to me. Here’s your money ... because I am in great need of them ...yooand I haven’t a minute, a minute to spare.”yooyooAnd taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to PyotryooIlyitch.yooyoo“But I shan’t have change enough. Haven’t you less?”yooyoo“No,” said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though not trustingyoohis own words he turned over two or three of the topmost ones.yooyoo“No, they’re all alike,” he added, and again he looked inquiringly atyooPyotr Ilyitch.yooyoo“How have you grown so rich?” the latter asked. “Wait, I’ll send my boy toyooPlotnikov’s, they close late—to see if they won’t change it. Here, Misha!”yoohe called into the passage.yooyoo“To Plotnikov’s shop—first-rate!” cried Mitya, as though struck by anyooidea. “Misha,” he turned to the boy as he came in, “look here, run toyooPlotnikov’s and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch sends his greetings,yooand will be there directly.... But listen, listen, tell them to haveyoochampagne, three dozen bottles, ready before I come, and packed as it wasyooto take to Mokroe. I took four dozen with me then,” he added (suddenlyyooaddressing Pyotr Ilyitch); “they know all about it, don’t you trouble,yooMisha,” he turned again to the boy. “Stay, listen; tell them to put inyoocheese, Strasburg pies, smoked fish, ham, caviare, and everything,yooeverything they’ve got, up to a hundred roubles, or a hundred and twentyyooas before.... But wait: don’t let them forget dessert, sweets, pears,yoowater-melons, two or three or four—no, one melon’s enough, and chocolate,yoocandy, toffee, fondants; in fact, everything I took to Mokroe before,yoothree hundred roubles’ worth with the champagne ... let it be just theyoosame again. And remember, Misha, if you are called Misha—His name isyooMisha, isn’t it?” He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again.yooyoo“Wait a minute,” Protr Ilyitch intervened, listening and watching himyoouneasily, “you’d better go yourself and tell them. He’ll muddle it.”yooyoo“He will, I see he will! Eh, Misha! Why, I was going to kiss you for theyoocommission.... If you don’t make a mistake, there’s ten roubles for you,yoorun along, make haste.... Champagne’s the chief thing, let them bring upyoochampagne. And brandy, too, and red and white wine, and all I had then....yooThey know what I had then.”yooyoo“But listen!” Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience. “I say, letyoohim simply run and change the money and tell them not to close, and you goyooand tell them.... Give him your note. Be off, Misha! Put your best legyooforward!”yooyooPyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because the boyyooremained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open, apparentlyyoounderstanding little of Mitya’s orders, gazing up with amazement andyooterror at his blood-stained face and the trembling bloodstained fingersyoothat held the notes.yooyoo“Well, now come and wash,” said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly. “Put the money onyoothe table or else in your pocket.... That’s right, come along. But takeyoooff your coat.”yooyooAnd beginning to help him off with his coat, he cried out again:yooyoo“Look, your coat’s covered with blood, too!”yooyoo“That ... it’s not the coat. It’s only a little here on the sleeve.... Andyoothat’s only here where the handkerchief lay. It must have soaked through.yooI must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya’s, and the blood’s comeyoothrough,” Mitya explained at once with a childlike unconsciousness thatyoowas astounding. Pyotr Ilyitch listened, frowning.yooyoo“Well, you must have been up to something; you must have been fightingyoowith some one,” he muttered.yooyooThey began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the water.yooMitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his hands (they were trembling,yooand Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards). But the young officialyooinsisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more. He seemedyooto exercise more and more sway over Mitya, as time went on. It may beyoonoted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character.yooyoo“Look, you haven’t got your nails clean. Now rub your face; here, on youryootemples, by your ear.... Will you go in that shirt? Where are you going?yooLook, all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood.”yooyoo“Yes, it’s all bloody,” observed Mitya, looking at the cuff of his shirt.yooyoo“Then change your shirt.”yooyoo“I haven’t time. You see I’ll ...” Mitya went on with the same confidingyooingenuousness, drying his face and hands on the towel, and putting on hisyoocoat. “I’ll turn it up at the wrist. It won’t be seen under the coat....yooYou see!”yooyoo“Tell me now, what game have you been up to? Have you been fighting withyoosome one? In the tavern again, as before? Have you been beating thatyoocaptain again?” Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully. “Whom have you beenyoobeating now ... or killing, perhaps?”yooyoo“Nonsense!” said Mitya.yooyoo“Why ‘nonsense’?”yooyoo“Don’t worry,” said Mitya, and he suddenly laughed. “I smashed an oldyoowoman in the market-place just now.”yooyoo“Smashed? An old woman?”yooyoo“An old man!” cried Mitya, looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face,yoolaughing, and shouting at him as though he were deaf.yooyoo“Confound it! An old woman, an old man.... Have you killed some one?”yooyoo“We made it up. We had a row—and made it up. In a place I know of. Weyooparted friends. A fool.... He’s forgiven me.... He’s sure to have forgivenyoome by now ... if he had got up, he wouldn’t have forgiven me”—Mityayoosuddenly winked—“only damn him, you know, I say, Pyotr Ilyitch, damn him!yooDon’t worry about him! I don’t want to just now!” Mitya snapped out,yooresolutely.yooyoo“Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with every one for? ... Justyooas you did with that captain over some nonsense.... You’ve been fightingyooand now you’re rushing off on the spree—that’s you all over! Three dozenyoochampagne—what do you want all that for?”yooyoo“Bravo! Now give me the pistols. Upon my honor I’ve no time now. I shouldyoolike to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but I haven’t the time. Andyoothere’s no need, it’s too late for talking. Where’s my money? Where have Iyooput it?” he cried, thrusting his hands into his pockets.yooyoo“You put it on the table ... yourself.... Here it is. Had you forgotten?yooMoney’s like dirt or water to you, it seems. Here are your pistols. It’syooan odd thing, at six o’clock you pledged them for ten roubles, and nowyooyou’ve got thousands. Two or three I should say.”yooyoo“Three, you bet,” laughed Mitya, stuffing the notes into the side-pocketyooof his trousers.yooyoo“You’ll lose it like that. Have you found a gold-mine?”yooyoo“The mines? The gold-mines?” Mitya shouted at the top of his voice andyoowent off into a roar of laughter. “Would you like to go to the mines,yooPerhotin? There’s a lady here who’ll stump up three thousand for you, ifyooonly you’ll go. She did it for me, she’s so awfully fond of gold-mines. Doyooyou know Madame Hohlakov?”yooyoo“I don’t know her, but I’ve heard of her and seen her. Did she really giveyooyou three thousand? Did she really?” said Pyotr Ilyitch, eyeing himyoodubiously.yooyoo“As soon as the sun rises to-morrow, as soon as Phœbus, ever young, fliesyooupwards, praising and glorifying God, you go to her, this Madame Hohlakov,yooand ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or not. Try andyoofind out.”yooyoo“I don’t know on what terms you are ... since you say it so positively, Iyoosuppose she did give it to you. You’ve got the money in your hand, butyooinstead of going to Siberia you’re spending it all.... Where are youyooreally off to now, eh?”yooyoo“To Mokroe.”yooyoo“To Mokroe? But it’s night!”yooyoo“Once the lad had all, now the lad has naught,” cried Mitya suddenly.yooyoo“How ‘naught’? You say that with all those thousands!”yooyoo“I’m not talking about thousands. Damn thousands! I’m talking of theyoofemale character.yooyooyoo    Fickle is the heart of womanyoo    Treacherous and full of vice;yooyooyooI agree with Ulysses. That’s what he says.”yooyoo“I don’t understand you!”yooyoo“Am I drunk?”yooyoo“Not drunk, but worse.”yooyoo“I’m drunk in spirit, Pyotr Ilyitch, drunk in spirit! But that’s enough!”yooyoo“What are you doing, loading the pistol?”yooyoo“I’m loading the pistol.”yooyooUnfastening the pistol-case, Mitya actually opened the powder horn, andyoocarefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge. Then he took the bullet and,yoobefore inserting it, held it in two fingers in front of the candle.yooyoo“Why are you looking at the bullet?” asked Pyotr Ilyitch, watching himyoowith uneasy curiosity.yooyoo“Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your brain, wouldyooyou look at it or not?”yooyoo“Why look at it?”yooyoo“It’s going into my brain, so it’s interesting to look and see what it’syoolike. But that’s foolishness, a moment’s foolishness. Now that’s done,” heyooadded, putting in the bullet and driving it home with the ramrod. “PyotryooIlyitch, my dear fellow, that’s nonsense, all nonsense, and if only youyooknew what nonsense! Give me a little piece of paper now.”yooyoo“Here’s some paper.”yooyoo“No, a clean new piece, writing-paper. That’s right.”yooyooAnd taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two lines, folded theyoopaper in four, and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket. He put the pistolsyooin the case, locked it up, and kept it in his hand. Then he looked atyooPyotr Ilyitch with a slow, thoughtful smile.yooyoo“Now, let’s go.”yooyoo“Where are we going? No, wait a minute.... Are you thinking of puttingyoothat bullet in your brain, perhaps?” Pyotr Ilyitch asked uneasily.yooyoo“I was fooling about the bullet! I want to live. I love life! You may beyoosure of that. I love golden-haired Phœbus and his warm light.... DearyooPyotr Ilyitch, do you know how to step aside?”yooyoo“What do you mean by ‘stepping aside’?”yooyoo“Making way. Making way for a dear creature, and for one I hate. And toyoolet the one I hate become dear—that’s what making way means! And to say toyoothem: God bless you, go your way, pass on, while I—”yooyoo“While you—?”yooyoo“That’s enough, let’s go.”yooyoo“Upon my word. I’ll tell some one to prevent your going there,” said PyotryooIlyitch, looking at him. “What are you going to Mokroe for, now?”yooyoo“There’s a woman there, a woman. That’s enough for you. You shut up.”yooyoo“Listen, though you’re such a savage I’ve always liked you.... I feelyooanxious.”yooyoo“Thanks, old fellow. I’m a savage you say. Savages, savages! That’s what Iyooam always saying. Savages! Why, here’s Misha! I was forgetting him.”yooyooMisha ran in, post-haste, with a handful of notes in change, and reportedyoothat every one was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs’; “They’re carrying downyoothe bottles, and the fish, and the tea; it will all be ready directly.”yooMitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr Ilyitch, then tossedyooanother ten-rouble note to Misha.yooyoo“Don’t dare to do such a thing!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch. “I won’t have it inyoomy house, it’s a bad, demoralizing habit. Put your money away. Here, putyooit here, why waste it? It would come in handy to-morrow, and I dare sayyooyou’ll be coming to me to borrow ten roubles again. Why do you keepyooputting the notes in your side-pocket? Ah, you’ll lose them!”yooyoo“I say, my dear fellow, let’s go to Mokroe together.”yooyoo“What should I go for?”yooyoo“I say, let’s open a bottle at once, and drink to life! I want to drink,yooand especially to drink with you. I’ve never drunk with you, have I?”yooyoo“Very well, we can go to the ‘Metropolis.’ I was just going there.”yooyoo“I haven’t time for that. Let’s drink at the Plotnikovs’, in the backyooroom. Shall I ask you a riddle?”yooyoo“Ask away.”yooyooMitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket, unfolded it andyooshowed it. In a large, distinct hand was written: “I punish myself for myyoowhole life, my whole life I punish!”yooyoo“I will certainly speak to some one, I’ll go at once,” said Pyotr Ilyitch,yooafter reading the paper.yooyoo“You won’t have time, dear boy, come and have a drink. March!”yooyooPlotnikov’s shop was at the corner of the street, next door but one toyooPyotr Ilyitch’s. It was the largest grocery shop in our town, and by noyoomeans a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants. They kept everythingyoothat could be got in a Petersburg shop, grocery of all sort, winesyoo“bottled by the brothers Eliseyev,” fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar,yooand so on. There were three shop-assistants and two errand boys alwaysyooemployed. Though our part of the country had grown poorer, the landownersyoohad gone away, and trade had got worse, yet the grocery stores flourishedyooas before, every year with increasing prosperity; there were plenty ofyoopurchasers for their goods.yooyooThey were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop. They had vividyoorecollections of how he had bought, three or four weeks ago, wine andyoogoods of all sorts to the value of several hundred roubles, paid for inyoocash (they would never have let him have anything on credit, of course).yooThey remembered that then, as now, he had had a bundle of hundred-roubleyoonotes in his hand, and had scattered them at random, without bargaining,yoowithout reflecting, or caring to reflect what use so much wine andyooprovisions would be to him. The story was told all over the town that,yoodriving off then with Grushenka to Mokroe, he had “spent three thousand inyooone night and the following day, and had come back from the spree withoutyooa penny.” He had picked up a whole troop of gypsies (encamped in ouryooneighborhood at the time), who for two days got money without stint out ofyoohim while he was drunk, and drank expensive wine without stint. Peopleyooused to tell, laughing at Mitya, how he had given champagne toyoogrimy-handed peasants, and feasted the village women and girls on sweetsyooand Strasburg pies. Though to laugh at Mitya to his face was rather ayoorisky proceeding, there was much laughter behind his back, especially inyoothe tavern, at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out ofyooGrushenka by this “escapade” was “permission to kiss her foot, and thatyoowas the utmost she had allowed him.”yooyooBy the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop, they found a cartyoowith three horses harnessed abreast with bells, and with Andrey, theyoodriver, ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance. In the shop they hadyooalmost entirely finished packing one box of provisions, and were onlyyoowaiting for Mitya’s arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart. PyotryooIlyitch was astounded.yooyoo“Where did this cart come from in such a hurry?” he asked Mitya.yooyoo“I met Andrey as I ran to you, and told him to drive straight here to theyooshop. There’s no time to lose. Last time I drove with Timofey, but Timofeyyoonow has gone on before me with the witch. Shall we be very late, Andrey?”yooyoo“They’ll only get there an hour at most before us, not even that maybe. Iyoogot Timofey ready to start. I know how he’ll go. Their pace won’t be ours,yooDmitri Fyodorovitch. How could it be? They won’t get there an houryooearlier!” Andrey, a lanky, red-haired, middle-aged driver, wearing ayoofull-skirted coat, and with a kaftan on his arm, replied warmly.yooyoo“Fifty roubles for vodka if we’re only an hour behind them.”yooyoo“I warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Ech, they won’t be half an houryoobefore us, let alone an hour.”yooyooThough Mitya bustled about seeing after things, he gave his ordersyoostrangely, as it were disconnectedly, and inconsecutively. He began ayoosentence and forgot the end of it. Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged toyoocome to the rescue.yooyoo“Four hundred roubles’ worth, not less than four hundred roubles’ worth,yoojust as it was then,” commanded Mitya. “Four dozen champagne, not a bottleyooless.”yooyoo“What do you want with so much? What’s it for? Stay!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch.yoo“What’s this box? What’s in it? Surely there isn’t four hundred roubles’yooworth here?”yooyooThe officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the firstyoobox contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne, and only “the mostyooindispensable articles,” such as savories, sweets, toffee, etc. But theyoomain part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent off, as on theyooprevious occasion, in a special cart also with three horses traveling atyoofull speed, so that it would arrive not more than an hour later thanyooDmitri Fyodorovitch himself.yooyoo“Not more than an hour! Not more than an hour! And put in more toffee andyoofondants. The girls there are so fond of it,” Mitya insisted hotly.yooyoo“The fondants are all right. But what do you want with four dozen ofyoochampagne? One would be enough,” said Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angry. Heyoobegan bargaining, asking for a bill of the goods, and refused to beyoosatisfied. But he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles. In the endyooit was agreed that only three hundred roubles’ worth should be sent.yooyoo“Well, you may go to the devil!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch, on second thoughts.yoo“What’s it to do with me? Throw away your money, since it’s cost youyoonothing.”yooyoo“This way, my economist, this way, don’t be angry.” Mitya drew him into ayooroom at the back of the shop. “They’ll give us a bottle here directly.yooWe’ll taste it. Ech, Pyotr Ilyitch, come along with me, for you’re a niceyoofellow, the sort I like.”yooyooMitya sat down on a wicker chair, before a little table, covered with ayoodirty dinner-napkin. Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite, and the champagneyoosoon appeared, and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen. “First-classyoooysters, the last lot in.”yooyoo“Hang the oysters. I don’t eat them. And we don’t need anything,” criedyooPyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.yooyoo“There’s no time for oysters,” said Mitya. “And I’m not hungry. Do youyooknow, friend,” he said suddenly, with feeling, “I never have liked allyoothis disorder.”yooyoo“Who does like it? Three dozen of champagne for peasants, upon my word,yoothat’s enough to make any one angry!”yooyoo“That’s not what I mean. I’m talking of a higher order. There’s no orderyooin me, no higher order. But ... that’s all over. There’s no need to grieveyooabout it. It’s too late, damn it! My whole life has been disorder, and oneyoomust set it in order. Is that a pun, eh?”yooyoo“You’re raving, not making puns!”yooyooyoo    “Glory be to God in Heaven,yoo    Glory be to God in me....yooyooyoo“That verse came from my heart once, it’s not a verse, but a tear.... Iyoomade it myself ... not while I was pulling the captain’s beard,yoothough....”yooyoo“Why do you bring him in all of a sudden?”yooyoo“Why do I bring him in? Foolery! All things come to an end; all things areyoomade equal. That’s the long and short of it.”yooyoo“You know, I keep thinking of your pistols.”yooyoo“That’s all foolery, too! Drink, and don’t be fanciful. I love life. I’veyooloved life too much, shamefully much. Enough! Let’s drink to life, dearyooboy, I propose the toast. Why am I pleased with myself? I’m a scoundrel,yoobut I’m satisfied with myself. And yet I’m tortured by the thought thatyooI’m a scoundrel, but satisfied with myself. I bless the creation. I’myooready to bless God and His creation directly, but ... I must kill oneyoonoxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others.... Letyoous drink to life, dear brother. What can be more precious than life?yooNothing! To life, and to one queen of queens!”yooyoo“Let’s drink to life and to your queen, too, if you like.”yooyooThey drank a glass each. Although Mitya was excited and expansive, yet heyoowas melancholy, too. It was as though some heavy, overwhelming anxietyyoowere weighing upon him.yooyoo“Misha ... here’s your Misha come! Misha, come here, my boy, drink thisyooglass to Phœbus, the golden-haired, of to-morrow morn....”yooyoo“What are you giving it him for?” cried Pyotr Ilyitch, irritably.yooyoo“Yes, yes, yes, let me! I want to!”yooyoo“E—ech!”yooyooMisha emptied the glass, bowed, and ran out.yooyoo“He’ll remember it afterwards,” Mitya remarked. “Woman, I love woman! Whatyoois woman? The queen of creation! My heart is sad, my heart is sad, PyotryooIlyitch. Do you remember Hamlet? ‘I am very sorry, good Horatio! Alas,yoopoor Yorick!’ Perhaps that’s me, Yorick? Yes, I’m Yorick now, and a skullyooafterwards.”yooyooPyotr Ilyitch listened in silence. Mitya, too, was silent for a while.yooyoo“What dog’s that you’ve got here?” he asked the shopman, casually,yoonoticing a pretty little lap-dog with dark eyes, sitting in the corner.yooyoo“It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress,” answered the clerk. “Sheyoobrought it and forgot it here. It must be taken back to her.”yooyoo“I saw one like it ... in the regiment ...” murmured Mitya dreamily, “onlyyoothat one had its hind leg broken.... By the way, Pyotr Ilyitch, I wantedyooto ask you: have you ever stolen anything in your life?”yooyoo“What a question!”yooyoo“Oh, I didn’t mean anything. From somebody’s pocket, you know. I don’tyoomean government money, every one steals that, and no doubt you do,yootoo....”yooyoo“You go to the devil.”yooyoo“I’m talking of other people’s money. Stealing straight out of a pocket?yooOut of a purse, eh?”yooyoo“I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old. I tookyooit off the table on the sly, and held it tight in my hand.”yooyoo“Well, and what happened?”yooyoo“Oh, nothing. I kept it three days, then I felt ashamed, confessed, andyoogave it back.”yooyoo“And what then?”yooyoo“Naturally I was whipped. But why do you ask? Have you stolen something?”yooyoo“I have,” said Mitya, winking slyly.yooyoo“What have you stolen?” inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously.yooyoo“I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old, and gaveyooit back three days after.”yooyooAs he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.yooyoo“Dmitri Fyodorovitch, won’t you come now?” called Andrey from the door ofyoothe shop.yooyoo“Are you ready? We’ll come!” Mitya started. “A few more last wordsyooand—Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting. Give him some brandy as well!yooThat box” (the one with the pistols) “put under my seat. Good-by, PyotryooIlyitch, don’t remember evil against me.”yooyoo“But you’re coming back to-morrow?”yooyoo“Of course.”yooyoo“Will you settle the little bill now?” cried the clerk, springing forward.yooyoo“Oh, yes, the bill. Of course.”yooyooHe pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again, picked out threeyoohundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran hurriedly out of theyooshop. Every one followed him out, bowing and wishing him good luck.yooAndrey, coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed, jumped up on theyoobox. But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surpriseyoohe saw Fenya before him. She ran up panting, clasped her hands before himyoowith a cry, and plumped down at his feet.yooyoo“Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don’t harm myyoomistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And don’t murder him, heyoocame first, he’s hers! He’ll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now. That’s whyyoohe’s come back from Siberia. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear, don’t take ayoofellow creature’s life!”yooyoo“Tut—tut—tut! That’s it, is it? So you’re off there to make trouble!”yoomuttered Pyotr Ilyitch. “Now, it’s all clear, as clear as daylight. DmitriyooFyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave like ayooman,” he shouted aloud to Mitya. “Do you hear, Dmitri?”yooyoo“The pistols? Wait a bit, brother, I’ll throw them into the pool on theyooroad,” answered Mitya. “Fenya, get up, don’t kneel to me. Mitya won’t hurtyooany one, the silly fool won’t hurt any one again. But I say, Fenya,” heyooshouted, after having taken his seat. “I hurt you just now, so forgive meyooand have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel.... But it doesn’t matter if youyoodon’t. It’s all the same now. Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along fullyoospeed!”yooyooAndrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing.yooyoo“Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...”yooyoo“He’s not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,” Pyotr Ilyitchyoothought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay and see the cartyoopacked with the remaining wines and provisions, knowing that they wouldyoodeceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly feeling vexed with himself, heyooturned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards.yooyoo“He’s a fool, though he’s a good fellow,” he muttered as he went. “I’veyooheard of that officer, Grushenka’s former flame. Well, if he has turnedyooup.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I’m not his nurse! Let them doyoowhat they like! Besides, it’ll all come to nothing. They’re a set ofyoobrawlers, that’s all. They’ll drink and fight, fight and make friendsyooagain. They are not men who do anything real. What does he mean by ‘I’myoostepping aside, I’m punishing myself?’ It’ll come to nothing! He’s shoutedyoosuch phrases a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he’s notyoodrunk. ‘Drunk in spirit’—they’re fond of fine phrases, the villains. Am Iyoohis nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all over blood. Withyoowhom? I shall find out at the ‘Metropolis.’ And his handkerchief wasyoosoaked in blood.... It’s still lying on my floor.... Hang it!”yooyooHe reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a game. The gameyoocheered him. He played a second game, and suddenly began telling one ofyoohis partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in for some cashyooagain—something like three thousand roubles, and had gone to Mokroe againyooto spend it with Grushenka.... This news roused singular interest in hisyoolisteners. They all spoke of it, not laughing, but with a strange gravity.yooThey left off playing.yooyoo“Three thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?”yooyooQuestions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov’s present was receivedyoowith skepticism.yooyoo“Hasn’t he robbed his old father?—that’s the question.”yooyoo“Three thousand! There’s something odd about it.”yooyoo“He boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard him, here.yooAnd it was three thousand he talked about ...”yooyooPyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in hisyooanswers. He said not a word about the blood on Mitya’s face and hands,yoothough he had meant to speak of it at first.yooyooThey began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya died away.yooBut by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire foryoobilliards; he laid down the cue, and without having supper as he hadyoointended, he walked out of the tavern. When he reached the market-place heyoostood still in perplexity, wondering at himself. He realized that what heyoowanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s and find out if anything hadyoohappened there. “On account of some stupid nonsense—as it’s sure to turnyooout—am I going to wake up the household and make a scandal? Fooh! damn it,yoois it my business to look after them?”yooyooIn a very bad humor he went straight home, and suddenly remembered Fenya.yoo“Damn it all! I ought to have questioned her just now,” he thought withyoovexation, “I should have heard everything.” And the desire to speak toyooher, and so find out, became so pressing and importunate that when he wasyoohalf-way home he turned abruptly and went towards the house whereyooGrushenka lodged. Going up to the gate he knocked. The sound of the knockyooin the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed. And noyooone answered him; every one in the house was asleep.yooyoo“And I shall be making a fuss!” he thought, with a feeling of positiveyoodiscomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell to knockingyooagain with all his might, filling the street with clamor.yooyoo“Not coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!” he muttered at eachyooknock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled his knocks onyoothe gate.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. “I Am Coming, Too!”yooyooyooBut Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a little moreyoothan twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey’s three horses galloped at such ayoopace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter. Theyooswift motion revived Mitya. The air was fresh and cool, there were bigyoostars shining in the sky. It was the very night, and perhaps the veryyoohour, in which Alyosha fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love ityoofor ever and ever.yooyooAll was confusion, confusion, in Mitya’s soul, but although many thingsyoowere goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was yearning foryooher, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time.yooOne thing I can say for certain; his heart did not waver for one instant.yooI shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous lover feltyoonot the slightest jealousy of this new rival, who seemed to have sprungyooout of the earth. If any other had appeared on the scene, he would haveyoobeen jealous at once, and would perhaps have stained his fierce hands withyooblood again. But as he flew through the night, he felt no envy, noyoohostility even, for the man who had been her first lover.... It is true heyoohad not yet seen him.yooyoo“Here there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his; this wasyooher first love which, after five years, she had not forgotten; so she hadyooloved him only for those five years, and I, how do I come in? What rightyoohave I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way! What am I now? Now everything isyooover apart from the officer—even if he had not appeared, everything wouldyoobe over ...”yooyooThese words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had beenyoocapable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment. His presentyooplan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenya’s first words, ityoohad sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a flash, with all itsyooconsequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution, there was confusion inyoohis soul, an agonizing confusion: his resolution did not give him peace.yooThere was so much behind that tortured him. And it seemed strange to him,yooat moments, to think that he had written his own sentence of death withyoopen and paper: “I punish myself,” and the paper was lying there in hisyoopocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how, nextyoomorning, he would meet the first warm ray of “golden-haired Phœbus.”yooyooAnd yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left behindyooand that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the thought of it sankyoointo his heart with despair. There was one moment when he felt an impulseyooto stop Andrey, to jump out of the cart, to pull out his loaded pistol,yooand to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn. But thatyoomoment flew by like a spark. The horses galloped on, “devouring space,”yooand as he drew near his goal, again the thought of her, of her alone, tookyoomore and more complete possession of his soul, chasing away the fearfulyooimages that had been haunting it. Oh, how he longed to look upon her, ifyooonly for a moment, if only from a distance!yooyoo“She’s now with _him_,” he thought, “now I shall see what she looks likeyoowith him, her first love, and that’s all I want.” Never had this woman,yoowho was such a fateful influence in his life, aroused such love in hisyoobreast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising even to himself, ayoofeeling tender to devoutness, to self-effacement before her! “I willyooefface myself!” he said, in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy.yooyooThey had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and thoughyooAndrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter a word,yooeither. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up smartly his threeyoolean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya cried out in horribleyooanxiety:yooyoo“Andrey! What if they’re asleep?”yooyooThis thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to him before.yooyoo“It may well be that they’re gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”yooyooMitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he was rushing there ...yoowith such feelings ... while they were asleep ... she was asleep, perhaps,yoothere too.... An angry feeling surged up in his heart.yooyoo“Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!” he cried, beside himself.yooyoo“But maybe they’re not in bed!” Andrey went on after a pause. “Timofeyyoosaid they were a lot of them there—”yooyoo“At the station?”yooyoo“Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov’s, at the inn, where theyyoolet out horses, too.”yooyoo“I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How’s that? Who are they?”yoocried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.yooyoo“Well, Timofey was saying they’re all gentlefolk. Two from our town—whoyoothey are I can’t say—and there are two others, strangers, maybe moreyoobesides. I didn’t ask particularly. They’ve set to playing cards, soyooTimofey said.”yooyoo“Cards?”yooyoo“So, maybe they’re not in bed if they’re at cards. It’s most likely notyoomore than eleven.”yooyoo“Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!” Mitya cried again, nervously.yooyoo“May I ask you something, sir?” said Andrey, after a pause. “Only I’myooafraid of angering you, sir.”yooyoo“What is it?”yooyoo“Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you not toyooharm her mistress, and some one else, too ... so you see, sir— It’s I amyootaking you there ... forgive me, sir, it’s my conscience ... maybe it’syoostupid of me to speak of it—”yooyooMitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.yooyoo“Are you a driver?” he asked frantically.yooyoo“Yes, sir.”yooyoo“Then you know that one has to make way. What would you say to a driveryoowho wouldn’t make way for any one, but would just drive on and crushyoopeople? No, a driver mustn’t run over people. One can’t run over a man.yooOne can’t spoil people’s lives. And if you have spoilt a life—punishyooyourself.... If only you’ve spoilt, if only you’ve ruined any one’syoolife—punish yourself and go away.”yooyooThese phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though Andrey wasyoosurprised at him, he kept up the conversation.yooyoo“That’s right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you’re quite right, one mustn’t crushyooor torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every creature is createdyooby God. Take a horse, for instance, for some folks, even among us drivers,yoodrive anyhow. Nothing will restrain them, they just force it along.”yooyoo“To hell?” Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt, short laugh.yoo“Andrey, simple soul,” he seized him by the shoulders again, “tell me,yoowill Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not, what do you think?”yooyoo“I don’t know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... you see, sir,yoowhen the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He went straightyoodown to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that were in agony.yooAnd the devil groaned, because he thought that he would get no moreyoosinners in hell. And God said to him, then, ‘Don’t groan, for you shallyoohave all the mighty of the earth, the rulers, the chief judges, and theyoorich men, and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till Iyoocome again.’ Those were His very words ...”yooyoo“A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!”yooyoo“So you see, sir, who it is hell’s for,” said Andrey, whipping up the leftyoohorse, “but you’re like a little child ... that’s how we look on you ...yooand though you’re hasty-tempered, sir, yet God will forgive you for youryookind heart.”yooyoo“And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?”yooyoo“What should I forgive you for, sir? You’ve never done me any harm.”yooyoo“No, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road, will youyooforgive me for every one? Speak, simple peasant heart!”yooyoo“Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange.”yooyooBut Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering toyoohimself.yooyoo“Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn me. Let meyoopass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for I have condemned myself,yoodo not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord. I am a wretch, but I loveyooThee. If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love Thee there, and from thereyooI shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever.... But let me love toyoothe end.... Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light ofyooThy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I cannotyoohelp loving her. Thou seest my whole heart.... I shall gallop up, I shallyoofall before her and say, ‘You are right to pass on and leave me. Farewellyooand forget your victim ... never fret yourself about me!’ ”yooyoo“Mokroe!” cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.yooyooThrough the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass ofyoobuildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The village ofyooMokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour all wereyooasleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.yooyoo“Drive on, Andrey, I come!” Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.yooyoo“They’re not asleep,” said Andrey again, pointing with his whip to theyooPlastunovs’ inn, which was at the entrance to the village. The sixyoowindows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.yooyoo“They’re not asleep,” Mitya repeated joyously. “Quicker, Andrey! Gallop!yooDrive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know that I haveyoocome. I’m coming! I’m coming, too!”yooyooAndrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash andyoopulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.yooyooMitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way to bed,yoopeeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.yooyoo“Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?”yooyooThe innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps, and rushedyooup to the guest with obsequious delight.yooyoo“Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again?”yooyooTrifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle height,yoowith a rather fat face. His expression was severe and uncompromising,yooespecially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had the power of assumingyoothe most obsequious countenance, when he had an inkling that it was to hisyoointerest. He dressed in Russian style, with a shirt buttoning down on oneyooside, and a full-skirted coat. He had saved a good sum of money, but wasyoofor ever dreaming of improving his position. More than half the peasantsyoowere in his clutches, every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him.yooFrom the neighboring landowners he bought and rented lands which wereyooworked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could never shakeyoooff. He was a widower, with four grown-up daughters. One of them wasyooalready a widow and lived in the inn with her two children, hisyoograndchildren, and worked for him like a charwoman. Another of hisyoodaughters was married to a petty official, and in one of the rooms of theyooinn, on the wall could be seen, among the family photographs, a miniatureyoophotograph of this official in uniform and official epaulettes. The twoyooyounger daughters used to wear fashionable blue or green dresses, fittingyootight at the back, and with trains a yard long, on Church holidays or whenyoothey went to pay visits. But next morning they would get up at dawn, asyoousual, sweep out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and cleanyooup after lodgers.yooyooIn spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon Borissovitch wasyoovery fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest, and remembering thatyoonot a month ago he had, in twenty-four hours, made two if not threeyoohundred roubles out of Dmitri, when he had come on his escapade withyooGrushenka, he met him now with eager welcome, scenting his prey the momentyooMitya drove up to the steps.yooyoo“Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!”yooyoo“Stay, Trifon Borissovitch,” began Mitya, “first and foremost, where isyooshe?”yooyoo“Agrafena Alexandrovna?” The inn-keeper understood at once, lookingyoosharply into Mitya’s face. “She’s here, too ...”yooyoo“With whom? With whom?”yooyoo“Some strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge from hisyoospeech. He sent the horses for her from here; and there’s another withyoohim, a friend of his, or a fellow traveler, there’s no telling. They’reyoodressed like civilians.”yooyoo“Well, are they feasting? Have they money?”yooyoo“Poor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”yooyoo“Nothing to boast of? And who are the others?”yooyoo“They’re two gentlemen from the town.... They’ve come back from Tcherny,yooand are putting up here. One’s quite a young gentleman, a relative of Mr.yooMiüsov, he must be, but I’ve forgotten his name ... and I expect you knowyoothe other, too, a gentleman called Maximov. He’s been on a pilgrimage, soyoohe says, to the monastery in the town. He’s traveling with this youngyoorelation of Mr. Miüsov.”yooyoo“Is that all?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing: What of her?yooHow is she?”yooyoo“Oh, she’s only just come. She’s sitting with them.”yooyoo“Is she cheerful? Is she laughing?”yooyoo“No, I think she’s not laughing much. She’s sitting quite dull. She’syoocombing the young gentleman’s hair.”yooyoo“The Pole—the officer?”yooyoo“He’s not young, and he’s not an officer, either. Not him, sir. It’s theyooyoung gentleman that’s Mr. Miüsov’s relation ... I’ve forgotten his name.”yooyoo“Kalganov.”yooyoo“That’s it, Kalganov!”yooyoo“All right. I’ll see for myself. Are they playing cards?”yooyoo“They have been playing, but they’ve left off. They’ve been drinking tea,yoothe official gentleman asked for liqueurs.”yooyoo“Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I’ll see for myself. Nowyooanswer one more question: are the gypsies here?”yooyoo“You can’t have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The authorities haveyoosent them away. But we’ve Jews that play the cymbals and the fiddle in theyoovillage, so one might send for them. They’d come.”yooyoo“Send for them. Certainly send for them!” cried Mitya. “And you can getyoothe girls together as you did then, Marya especially, Stepanida, too, andyooArina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!”yooyoo“Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though by nowyoothey’re asleep. Are the peasants here worth such kindness, DmitriyooFyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like that on suchyoocoarseness and rudeness! What’s the good of giving a peasant a cigar toyoosmoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are all lousy. Besides, I’llyooget my daughters up for nothing, let alone a sum like that. They’ve onlyyoojust gone to bed, I’ll give them a kick and set them singing for you. Youyoogave the peasants champagne to drink the other day, e—ech!”yooyooFor all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch had hiddenyoohalf a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion, and had picked upyooa hundred-rouble note under the table, and it had remained in hisyooclutches.yooyoo“Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last time I wasyoohere. Do you remember?”yooyoo“You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have left threeyoothousand behind you.”yooyoo“Well, I’ve come to do the same again, do you see?”yooyooAnd he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before theyooinnkeeper’s nose.yooyoo“Now, listen and remember. In an hour’s time the wine will arrive,yoosavories, pies, and sweets—bring them all up at once. That box Andrey hasyoogot is to be brought up at once, too. Open it, and hand champagneyooimmediately. And the girls, we must have the girls, Marya especially.”yooyooHe turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.yooyoo“Here, Andrey, let’s settle. Here’s fifteen roubles for the drive, andyoofifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love.... RememberyooKaramazov!”yooyoo“I’m afraid, sir,” faltered Andrey. “Give me five roubles extra, but moreyooI won’t take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive my foolish wordsyoo...”yooyoo“What are you afraid of?” asked Mitya, scanning him. “Well, go to theyoodevil, if that’s it!” he cried, flinging him five roubles. “Now, TrifonyooBorissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them, soyoothat they don’t see me. Where are they? In the blue room?”yooyooTrifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once obedientlyyoodid his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went himself into theyoofirst large room, adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting, andyootook the light away. Then he stealthily led Mitya in, and put him in ayoocorner in the dark, whence he could freely watch the company without beingyooseen. But Mitya did not look long, and, indeed, he could not see them, heyoosaw her, his heart throbbed violently, and all was dark before his eyes.yooyooShe was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside her, onyoothe sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding his hand andyooseemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and not looking at her, wasyoosaying something in a loud voice to Maximov, who sat the other side of theyootable, facing Grushenka. Maximov was laughing violently at something. Onyoothe sofa sat _he_, and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger.yooThe one on the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya hadyooan impression of a stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who wasyooapparently angry about something. His friend, the other stranger, struckyooMitya as extraordinarily tall, but he could make out nothing more. Heyoocaught his breath. He could not bear it for a minute, he put theyoopistol-case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he walked, feeling coldyooall over, straight into the blue room to face the company.yooyoo“Aie!” shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him.yooyooyooyooChapter VII. The First And Rightful LoveryooyooyooWith his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the table.yooyoo“Gentlemen,” he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering atyooevery word, “I ... I’m all right! Don’t be afraid!” he exclaimed,yoo“I—there’s nothing the matter,” he turned suddenly to Grushenka, who hadyooshrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov, and clasped his hand tightly.yoo“I ... I’m coming, too. I’m here till morning. Gentlemen, may I stay withyooyou till morning? Only till morning, for the last time, in this sameyooroom?”yooyooSo he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting onyoothe sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity andyooobserved severely:yooyoo“_Panie_, we’re here in private. There are other rooms.”yooyoo“Why, it’s you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?” answered Kalganovyoosuddenly. “Sit down with us. How are you?”yooyoo“Delighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always thought ayoolot of you.” Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at once holding outyoohis hand across the table.yooyoo“Aie! How tight you squeeze! You’ve quite broken my fingers,” laughedyooKalganov.yooyoo“He always squeezes like that, always,” Grushenka put in gayly, with ayootimid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya’s face that he was notyoogoing to make a scene. She was watching him with intense curiosity andyoostill some uneasiness. She was impressed by something about him, andyooindeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in andyoospeak like this at such a moment.yooyoo“Good evening,” Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya rushed up toyoohim, too.yooyoo“Good evening. You’re here, too! How glad I am to find you here, too!yooGentlemen, gentlemen, I—” (He addressed the Polish gentleman with the pipeyooagain, evidently taking him for the most important person present.) “Iyooflew here.... I wanted to spend my last day, my last hour in this room, inyoothis very room ... where I, too, adored ... my queen.... Forgive me,yoo_panie_,” he cried wildly, “I flew here and vowed— Oh, don’t be afraid,yooit’s my last night! Let’s drink to our good understanding. They’ll bringyoothe wine at once.... I brought this with me.” (Something made him pull outyoohis bundle of notes.) “Allow me, _panie_! I want to have music, singing, ayoorevel, as we had before. But the worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawlyooaway, and there’ll be no more of him. I will commemorate my day of joy onyoomy last night.”yooyooHe was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted to say, butyoostrange exclamations were all that came from his lips. The Pole gazedyoofixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand; looked at Grushenka,yooand was in evident perplexity.yooyoo“If my suverin lady is permitting—” he was beginning.yooyoo“What does ‘suverin’ mean? ‘Sovereign,’ I suppose?” interrupted Grushenka.yoo“I can’t help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit down, Mitya, what areyooyou talking about? Don’t frighten us, please. You won’t frighten us, willyooyou? If you won’t, I am glad to see you ...”yooyoo“Me, me frighten you?” cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. “Oh, pass meyooby, go your way, I won’t hinder you!...”yooyooAnd suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as well, byyooflinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning his headyooaway to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped the back of the chairyootight, as though embracing it.yooyoo“Come, come, what a fellow you are!” cried Grushenka reproachfully.yoo“That’s just how he comes to see me—he begins talking, and I can’t makeyooout what he means. He cried like that once before, and now he’s cryingyooagain! It’s shameful! Why are you crying? _As though you had anything toyoocry for!_” she added enigmatically, emphasizing each word with someyooirritability.yooyoo“I ... I’m not crying.... Well, good evening!” He instantly turned roundyooin his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his abrupt wooden laugh, but ayoolong, quivering, inaudible nervous laugh.yooyoo“Well, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!” Grushenka saidyooto him persuasively. “I’m very glad you’ve come, very glad, Mitya, do youyoohear, I’m very glad! I want him to stay here with us,” she saidyooperemptorily, addressing the whole company, though her words wereyooobviously meant for the man sitting on the sofa. “I wish it, I wish it!yooAnd if he goes away I shall go, too!” she added with flashing eyes.yooyoo“What my queen commands is law!” pronounced the Pole, gallantly kissingyooGrushenka’s hand. “I beg you, _panie_, to join our company,” he addedyoopolitely, addressing Mitya.yooyooMitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering anotheryootirade, but the words did not come.yooyoo“Let’s drink, _panie_,” he blurted out instead of making a speech. Everyyooone laughed.yooyoo“Good heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!” Grushenka exclaimedyoonervously. “Do you hear, Mitya,” she went on insistently, “don’t pranceyooabout, but it’s nice you’ve brought the champagne. I want some myself, andyooI can’t bear liqueurs. And best of all, you’ve come yourself. We wereyoofearfully dull here.... You’ve come for a spree again, I suppose? But putyooyour money in your pocket. Where did you get such a lot?”yooyooMitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled bundle ofyoonotes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were fixed. Inyooconfusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket. He flushed. At thatyoomoment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked bottle of champagne, andyooglasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up the bottle, but he was so bewilderedyoothat he did not know what to do with it. Kalganov took it from him andyoopoured out the champagne.yooyoo“Another! Another bottle!” Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and, forgettingyooto clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly invited to drink toyootheir good understanding, he drank off his glass without waiting for anyyooone else. His whole countenance suddenly changed. The solemn and tragicyooexpression with which he had entered vanished completely, and a look ofyoosomething childlike came into his face. He seemed to have become suddenlyyoogentle and subdued. He looked shyly and happily at every one, with ayoocontinual nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog whoyoohas done wrong, been punished, and forgiven. He seemed to have forgottenyooeverything, and was looking round at every one with a childlike smile ofyoodelight. He looked at Grushenka, laughing continually, and bringing hisyoochair close up to her. By degrees he had gained some idea of the twoyooPoles, though he had formed no definite conception of them yet.yooyooThe Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and his Polishyooaccent; and, above all, by his pipe. “Well, what of it? It’s a good thingyoohe’s smoking a pipe,” he reflected. The Pole’s puffy, middle-aged face,yoowith its tiny nose and two very thin, pointed, dyed and impudent-lookingyoomustaches, had not so far roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was notyooeven particularly struck by the Pole’s absurd wig made in Siberia, withyoolove-locks foolishly combed forward over the temples. “I suppose it’s allyooright since he wears a wig,” he went on, musing blissfully. The other,yooyounger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company andyoolistening to the conversation with silent contempt, still only impressedyooMitya by his great height, which was in striking contrast to the Pole onyoothe sofa. “If he stood up he’d be six foot three.” The thought flittedyoothrough Mitya’s mind. It occurred to him, too, that this Pole must be theyoofriend of the other, as it were, a “bodyguard,” and no doubt the big Poleyoowas at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemedyooto Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his mood of doglikeyoosubmissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away.yooyooGrushenka’s mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he completelyyoofailed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling heart, was that she wasyookind to him, that she had forgiven him, and made him sit by her. He wasyoobeside himself with delight, watching her sip her glass of champagne. Theyoosilence of the company seemed somehow to strike him, however, and heyoolooked round at every one with expectant eyes.yooyoo“Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don’t you begin doingyoosomething?” his smiling eyes seemed to ask.yooyoo“He keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,” Kalganov beganyoosuddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing to Maximov.yooyooMitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.yooyoo“He’s talking nonsense?” he laughed, his short, wooden laugh, seemingyoosuddenly delighted at something—“ha ha!”yooyoo“Yes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry officersyooin the twenties married Polish women. That’s awful rot, isn’t it?”yooyoo“Polish women?” repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.yooyooKalganov was well aware of Mitya’s attitude to Grushenka, and he guessedyooabout the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest him, perhaps didyoonot interest him at all; what he was interested in was Maximov. He hadyoocome here with Maximov by chance, and he met the Poles here at the inn foryoothe first time in his life. Grushenka he knew before, and had once beenyoowith some one to see her; but she had not taken to him. But here sheyoolooked at him very affectionately: before Mitya’s arrival, she had beenyoomaking much of him, but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it. He was ayooboy, not over twenty, dressed like a dandy, with a very charmingyoofair-skinned face, and splendid thick, fair hair. From his fair faceyoolooked out beautiful pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and sometimesyooeven deep expression, beyond his age indeed, although the young manyoosometimes looked and talked quite like a child, and was not at all ashamedyooof it, even when he was aware of it himself. As a rule he was veryyoowillful, even capricious, though always friendly. Sometimes there wasyoosomething fixed and obstinate in his expression. He would look at you andyoolisten, seeming all the while to be persistently dreaming over somethingyooelse. Often he was listless and lazy, at other times he would growyooexcited, sometimes, apparently, over the most trivial matters.yooyoo“Only imagine, I’ve been taking him about with me for the last four days,”yoohe went on, indolently drawling his words, quite naturally though, withoutyoothe slightest affectation. “Ever since your brother, do you remember,yooshoved him off the carriage and sent him flying. That made me take anyoointerest in him at the time, and I took him into the country, but he keepsyootalking such rot I’m ashamed to be with him. I’m taking him back.”yooyoo“The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is impossible,”yoothe Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.yooyooHe spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he pretended. Ifyoohe used Russian words, he always distorted them into a Polish form.yooyoo“But I was married to a Polish lady myself,” tittered Maximov.yooyoo“But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the cavalry.yooWere you a cavalry officer?” put in Kalganov at once.yooyoo“Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!” cried Mitya, listening eagerly,yooand turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as though there wereyoono knowing what he might hear from each.yooyoo“No, you see,” Maximov turned to him. “What I mean is that those prettyyooPolish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ... whenyooone of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on his knee like ayookitten ... a little white one ... and the _pan_-father and _pan_-motheryoolook on and allow it.... They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comesyooand offers her his hand.... That’s how it is ... offers her his hand, heyoohe!” Maximov ended, tittering.yooyoo“The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly andyoocrossed one leg over the other. Mitya’s eye was caught by his huge greasedyooboot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of both the Poles lookedyoorather greasy.yooyoo“Well, now it’s _lajdak_! What’s he scolding about?” said Grushenka,yoosuddenly vexed.yooyoo“_Pani_ Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant girls,yooand not ladies of good birth,” the Pole with the pipe observed toyooGrushenka.yooyoo“You can reckon on that,” the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.yooyoo“What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It makes ityoocheerful,” Grushenka said crossly.yooyoo“I’m not hindering them, _pani_,” said the Pole in the wig, with a longyoolook at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he sucked his pipeyooagain.yooyoo“No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.” Kalganov got excitedyooagain, as though it were a question of vast import. “He’s never been inyooPoland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you weren’t married inyooPoland, were you?”yooyoo“No, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought her to Russiayoobefore that, my future wife, with her mamma and her aunt, and anotheryoofemale relation with a grown-up son. He brought her straight from Polandyooand gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant in our regiment, a very niceyooyoung man. At first he meant to marry her himself. But he didn’t marryyooher, because she turned out to be lame.”yooyoo“So you married a lame woman?” cried Kalganov.yooyoo“Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed it. Iyoothought she was hopping; she kept hopping.... I thought it was for fun.”yooyoo“So pleased she was going to marry you!” yelled Kalganov, in a ringing,yoochildish voice.yooyoo“Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause.yooAfterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very evening,yooshe confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. ‘I once jumped overyooa puddle when I was a child,’ she said, ‘and injured my leg.’ He he!”yooyooKalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling on theyoosofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness.yooyoo“Do you know, that’s the truth, he’s not lying now,” exclaimed Kalganov,yooturning to Mitya; “and do you know, he’s been married twice; it’s hisyoofirst wife he’s talking about. But his second wife, do you know, ran away,yooand is alive now.”yooyoo“Is it possible?” said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with anyooexpression of the utmost astonishment.yooyoo“Yes. She did run away. I’ve had that unpleasant experience,” Maximovyoomodestly assented, “with a _monsieur_. And what was worse, she’d had allyoomy little property transferred to her beforehand. ‘You’re an educatedyooman,’ she said to me. ‘You can always get your living.’ She settled myyoobusiness with that. A venerable bishop once said to me: ‘One of your wivesyoowas lame, but the other was too light-footed.’ He he!”yooyoo“Listen, listen!” cried Kalganov, bubbling over, “if he’s telling lies—andyoohe often is—he’s only doing it to amuse us all. There’s no harm in that,yoois there? You know, I sometimes like him. He’s awfully low, but it’syoonatural to him, eh? Don’t you think so? Some people are low fromyooself-interest, but he’s simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he claims (heyoowas arguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol wrote _Dead Souls_yooabout him. Do you remember, there’s a landowner called Maximov in it, whomyooNozdryov thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, ‘for inflicting bodilyyooinjury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.’ Wouldyooyou believe it, he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten!yooNow can it be so? Tchitchikov made his journey, at the very latest, at theyoobeginning of the twenties, so that the dates don’t fit. He couldn’t haveyoobeen thrashed then, he couldn’t, could he?”yooyooIt was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but hisyooexcitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without protest.yooyoo“Well, but if they did thrash him!” he cried, laughing.yooyoo“It’s not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is—” put inyooMaximov.yooyoo“What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn’t.”yooyoo“What o’clock is it, _panie_?” the Pole, with the pipe, asked his tallyoofriend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his shoulders inyooreply. Neither of them had a watch.yooyoo“Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn’t other people talk becauseyooyou’re bored?” Grushenka flew at him with evident intention of findingyoofault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mitya’s mind.yooThis time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability.yooyoo“_Pani_, I didn’t oppose it. I didn’t say anything.”yooyoo“All right then. Come, tell us your story,” Grushenka cried to Maximov.yoo“Why are you all silent?”yooyoo“There’s nothing to tell, it’s all so foolish,” answered Maximov at once,yoowith evident satisfaction, mincing a little. “Besides, all that’s by wayyooof allegory in Gogol, for he’s made all the names have a meaning. Nozdryovyoowas really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name, heyoowas called Shkvornev. Fenardi really was called Fenardi, only he wasn’t anyooItalian but a Russian, and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with heryoopretty little legs in tights, and she had a little short skirt withyoospangles, and she kept turning round and round, only not for four hoursyoobut for four minutes only, and she bewitched every one...”yooyoo“But what were you beaten for?” cried Kalganov.yooyoo“For Piron!” answered Maximov.yooyoo“What Piron?” cried Mitya.yooyoo“The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a big partyyooof us, in a tavern at that very fair. They’d invited me, and first of allyooI began quoting epigrams. ‘Is that you, Boileau? What a funny get-up!’ andyooBoileau answers that he’s going to a masquerade, that is to the baths, heyoohe! And they took it to themselves, so I made haste to repeat another,yoovery sarcastic, well known to all educated people:yooyooyoo    Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we!yoo    But one grief is weighing on me.yoo    You don’t know your way to the sea!yooyooyooThey were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemlyyooway for it. And as ill-luck would have it, to set things right, I beganyootelling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how he was not acceptedyoointo the French Academy, and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph:yooyooyoo    Ci-gît Piron qui ne fut rien,yoo    Pas même académicien.yooyooyooThey seized me and thrashed me.”yooyoo“But what for? What for?”yooyoo“For my education. People can thrash a man for anything,” Maximovyooconcluded, briefly and sententiously.yooyoo“Eh, that’s enough! That’s all stupid, I don’t want to listen. I thoughtyooit would be amusing,” Grushenka cut them short, suddenly.yooyooMitya started, and at once left off laughing. The tall Pole rose upon hisyoofeet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out of his element,yoobegan pacing from corner to corner of the room, his hands behind his back.yooyoo“Ah, he can’t sit still,” said Grushenka, looking at him contemptuously.yooMitya began to feel anxious. He noticed besides, that the Pole on the sofayoowas looking at him with an irritable expression.yooyoo“_Panie!_” cried Mitya, “let’s drink! and the other _pan_, too! Let usyoodrink.”yooyooIn a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him, and filled them withyoochampagne.yooyoo“To Poland, _panovie_, I drink to your Poland!” cried Mitya.yooyoo“I shall be delighted, _panie_,” said the Pole on the sofa, with dignityyooand affable condescension, and he took his glass.yooyoo“And the other _pan_, what’s his name? Drink, most illustrious, take youryooglass!” Mitya urged.yooyoo“Pan Vrublevsky,” put in the Pole on the sofa.yooyooPan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he walked.yooyoo“To Poland, _panovie!_” cried Mitya, raising his glass. “Hurrah!”yooyooAll three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out threeyooglasses.yooyoo“Now to Russia, _panovie_, and let us be brothers!”yooyoo“Pour out some for us,” said Grushenka; “I’ll drink to Russia, too!”yooyoo“So will I,” said Kalganov.yooyoo“And I would, too ... to Russia, the old grandmother!” tittered Maximov.yooyoo“All! All!” cried Mitya. “Trifon Borissovitch, some more bottles!”yooyooThe other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table.yooMitya filled the glasses.yooyoo“To Russia! Hurrah!” he shouted again. All drank the toast except theyooPoles, and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once. The Poles did notyootouch theirs.yooyoo“How’s this, _panovie_?” cried Mitya, “won’t you drink it?”yooyooPan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a resonant voice:yooyoo“To Russia as she was before 1772.”yooyoo“Come, that’s better!” cried the other Pole, and they both emptied theiryooglasses at once.yooyoo“You’re fools, you _panovie_,” broke suddenly from Mitya.yooyoo“_Panie!_” shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya like ayoocouple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.yooyoo“Can one help loving one’s own country?” he shouted.yooyoo“Be silent! Don’t quarrel! I won’t have any quarreling!” cried Grushenkayooimperiously, and she stamped her foot on the floor. Her face glowed, heryooeyes were shining. The effects of the glass she had just drunk wereyooapparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed.yooyoo“_Panovie_, forgive me! It was my fault, I’m sorry. Vrublevsky, _panie_yooVrublevsky, I’m sorry.”yooyoo“Hold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!” Grushenka scoldedyoowith angry annoyance.yooyooEvery one sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.yooyoo“Gentlemen, I was the cause of it all,” Mitya began again, unable to makeyooanything of Grushenka’s words. “Come, why are we sitting here? What shallyoowe do ... to amuse ourselves again?”yooyoo“Ach, it’s certainly anything but amusing!” Kalganov mumbled lazily.yooyoo“Let’s play faro again, as we did just now,” Maximov tittered suddenly.yooyoo“Faro? Splendid!” cried Mitya. “If only the _panovie_—”yooyoo“It’s lite, _panovie_,” the Pole on the sofa responded, as it wereyoounwillingly.yooyoo“That’s true,” assented Pan Vrublevsky.yooyoo“Lite? What do you mean by ‘lite’?” asked Grushenka.yooyoo“Late, _pani_! ‘a late hour’ I mean,” the Pole on the sofa explained.yooyoo“It’s always late with them. They can never do anything!” Grushenka almostyooshrieked in her anger. “They’re dull themselves, so they want others to beyoodull. Before you came, Mitya, they were just as silent and kept turning upyootheir noses at me.”yooyoo“My goddess!” cried the Pole on the sofa, “I see you’re not well-disposedyooto me, that’s why I’m gloomy. I’m ready, _panie_,” added he, addressingyooMitya.yooyoo“Begin, _panie_,” Mitya assented, pulling his notes out of his pocket, andyoolaying two hundred-rouble notes on the table. “I want to lose a lot toyooyou. Take your cards. Make the bank.”yooyoo“We’ll have cards from the landlord, _panie_,” said the little Pole,yoogravely and emphatically.yooyoo“That’s much the best way,” chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.yooyoo“From the landlord? Very good, I understand, let’s get them from him.yooCards!” Mitya shouted to the landlord.yooyooThe landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed Mitya that theyoogirls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the cymbals would mostyoolikely be here soon; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived.yooMitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders,yoobut only three girls had arrived, and Marya was not there yet. And he didyoonot know himself what orders to give and why he had run out. He only toldyoothem to take out of the box the presents for the girls, the sweets, theyootoffee and the fondants. “And vodka for Andrey, vodka for Andrey!” heyoocried in haste. “I was rude to Andrey!”yooyooSuddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, touched him on the shoulder.yooyoo“Give me five roubles,” he whispered to Mitya. “I’ll stake something atyoofaro, too, he he!”yooyoo“Capital! Splendid! Take ten, here!”yooyooAgain he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for tenyooroubles. “And if you lose that, come again, come again.”yooyoo“Very good,” Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again. Mitya,yootoo, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting. The Poles hadyooalready sat down, and opened the pack. They looked much more amiable,yooalmost cordial. The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and wasyoopreparing to throw. He wore an air of solemnity.yooyoo“To your places, gentlemen,” cried Pan Vrublevsky.yooyoo“No, I’m not going to play any more,” observed Kalganov, “I’ve lost fiftyyooroubles to them just now.”yooyoo“The _pan_ had no luck, perhaps he’ll be lucky this time,” the Pole on theyoosofa observed in his direction.yooyoo“How much in the bank? To correspond?” asked Mitya.yooyoo“That’s according, _panie_, maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, as much asyooyou will stake.”yooyoo“A million!” laughed Mitya.yooyoo“The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?”yooyoo“What Podvysotsky?”yooyoo“In Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it.yooPodvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against the bank.yooThe banker says, ‘_Panie_ Podvysotsky, are you laying down the gold, oryoomust we trust to your honor?’ ‘To my honor, _panie_,’ says Podvysotsky.yoo‘So much the better.’ The banker throws the dice. Podvysotsky wins. ‘Takeyooit, _panie_,’ says the banker, and pulling out the drawer he gives him ayoomillion. ‘Take it, _panie_, this is your gain.’ There was a million in theyoobank. ‘I didn’t know that,’ says Podvysotsky. ‘_Panie_ Podvysotsky,’ saidyoothe banker, ‘you pledged your honor and we pledged ours.’ Podvysotsky tookyoothe million.”yooyoo“That’s not true,” said Kalganov.yooyoo“_Panie_ Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesn’t say such things.”yooyoo“As if a Polish gambler would give away a million!” cried Mitya, butyoochecked himself at once. “Forgive me, _panie_, it’s my fault again, heyoowould, he would give away a million, for honor, for Polish honor. You seeyoohow I talk Polish, ha ha! Here, I stake ten roubles, the knave leads.”yooyoo“And I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the pretty littleyoo_panienotchka_, he he!” laughed Maximov, pulling out his queen, and, asyoothough trying to conceal it from every one, he moved right up and crossedyoohimself hurriedly under the table. Mitya won. The rouble won, too.yooyoo“A corner!” cried Mitya.yooyoo“I’ll bet another rouble, a ‘single’ stake,” Maximov muttered gleefully,yoohugely delighted at having won a rouble.yooyoo“Lost!” shouted Mitya. “A ‘double’ on the seven!”yooyooThe seven too was trumped.yooyoo“Stop!” cried Kalganov suddenly.yooyoo“Double! Double!” Mitya doubled his stakes, and each time he doubled theyoostake, the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles. The rouble stakesyookept winning.yooyoo“On the double!” shouted Mitya furiously.yooyoo“You’ve lost two hundred, _panie_. Will you stake another hundred?” theyooPole on the sofa inquired.yooyoo“What? Lost two hundred already? Then another two hundred! All doubles!”yooyooAnd pulling his money out of his pocket, Mitya was about to fling twoyoohundred roubles on the queen, but Kalganov covered it with his hand.yooyoo“That’s enough!” he shouted in his ringing voice.yooyoo“What’s the matter?” Mitya stared at him.yooyoo“That’s enough! I don’t want you to play any more. Don’t!”yooyoo“Why?”yooyoo“Because I don’t. Hang it, come away. That’s why. I won’t let you go onyooplaying.”yooyooMitya gazed at him in astonishment.yooyoo“Give it up, Mitya. He may be right. You’ve lost a lot as it is,” saidyooGrushenka, with a curious note in her voice. Both the Poles rose fromyootheir seats with a deeply offended air.yooyoo“Are you joking, _panie_?” said the short man, looking severely atyooKalganov.yooyoo“How dare you!” Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov.yooyoo“Don’t dare to shout like that,” cried Grushenka. “Ah, you turkey-cocks!”yooyooMitya looked at each of them in turn. But something in Grushenka’s faceyoosuddenly struck him, and at the same instant something new flashed intoyoohis mind—a strange new thought!yooyoo“_Pani_ Agrippina,” the little Pole was beginning, crimson with anger,yoowhen Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder.yooyoo“Most illustrious, two words with you.”yooyoo“What do you want?”yooyoo“In the next room, I’ve two words to say to you, something pleasant, veryyoopleasant. You’ll be glad to hear it.”yooyooThe little _pan_ was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya. Heyooagreed at once, however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them.yooyoo“The bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too. I must have him!” criedyooMitya. “March, _panovie_!”yooyoo“Where are you going?” asked Grushenka, anxiously.yooyoo“We’ll be back in one moment,” answered Mitya.yooyooThere was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in his eyes. Hisyooface had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before.yooyooHe led the Poles, not into the large room where the chorus of girls wasyooassembling and the table was being laid, but into the bedroom on theyooright, where the trunks and packages were kept, and there were two largeyoobeds, with pyramids of cotton pillows on each. There was a lighted candleyooon a small deal table in the corner. The small man and Mitya sat down toyoothis table, facing each other, while the huge Vrublevsky stood besideyoothem, his hands behind his back. The Poles looked severe but wereyooevidently inquisitive.yooyoo“What can I do for you, _panie_?” lisped the little Pole.yooyoo“Well, look here, _panie_, I won’t keep you long. There’s money for you,”yoohe pulled out his notes. “Would you like three thousand? Take it and goyooyour way.”yooyooThe Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.yooyoo“Three thousand, _panie_?” He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky.yooyoo“Three, _panovie_, three! Listen, _panie_, I see you’re a sensible man.yooTake three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with you—d’youyoohear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever. You understand that,yoo_panie_, for ever. Here’s the door, you go out of it. What have you gotyoothere, a great-coat, a fur coat? I’ll bring it out to you. They’ll get theyoohorses out directly, and then—good-by, _panie_!”yooyooMitya awaited an answer with assurance. He had no doubts. An expression ofyooextraordinary resolution passed over the Pole’s face.yooyoo“And the money, _panie_?”yooyoo“The money, _panie_? Five hundred roubles I’ll give you this moment foryoothe journey, and as a first installment, and two thousand five hundredyooto-morrow, in the town—I swear on my honor, I’ll get it, I’ll get it atyooany cost!” cried Mitya.yooyooThe Poles exchanged glances again. The short man’s face looked moreyooforbidding.yooyoo“Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at once, this minute,yoocash down!” Mitya added, feeling something wrong. “What’s the matter,yoo_panie_? Don’t you trust me? I can’t give you the whole three thousandyoostraight off. If I give it, you may come back to her to-morrow....yooBesides, I haven’t the three thousand with me. I’ve got it at home in theyootown,” faltered Mitya, his spirit sinking at every word he uttered. “Uponyoomy word, the money’s there, hidden.”yooyooIn an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself inyoothe little man’s face.yooyoo“What next?” he asked ironically. “For shame!” and he spat on the floor.yooPan Vrublevsky spat too.yooyoo“You do that, _panie_,” said Mitya, recognizing with despair that all wasyooover, “because you hope to make more out of Grushenka? You’re a couple ofyoocapons, that’s what you are!”yooyoo“This is a mortal insult!” The little Pole turned as red as a crab, and heyoowent out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear another word.yooVrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed, confused andyoocrestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that the _pan_ would atyooonce raise an outcry. And so indeed he did. The Pole walked into the roomyooand threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka.yooyoo“_Pani_ Agrippina, I have received a mortal insult!” he exclaimed. ButyooGrushenka suddenly lost all patience, as though they had wounded her inyoothe tenderest spot.yooyoo“Speak Russian! Speak Russian!” she cried, “not another word of Polish!yooYou used to talk Russian. You can’t have forgotten it in five years.”yooyooShe was red with passion.yooyoo“_Pani_ Agrippina—”yooyoo“My name’s Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I won’t listen!”yooyooThe Pole gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously deliveredyoohimself in broken Russian:yooyoo“_Pani_ Agrafena, I came here to forget the past and forgive it, to forgetyooall that has happened till to-day—”yooyoo“Forgive? Came here to forgive me?” Grushenka cut him short, jumping upyoofrom her seat.yooyoo“Just so, _pani_, I’m not pusillanimous, I’m magnanimous. But I wasyooastounded when I saw your lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three thousand, inyoothe other room to depart. I spat in the _pan’s_ face.”yooyoo“What? He offered you money for me?” cried Grushenka, hysterically. “Is ityootrue, Mitya? How dare you? Am I for sale?”yooyoo“_Panie, panie!_” yelled Mitya, “she’s pure and shining, and I have neveryoobeen her lover! That’s a lie....”yooyoo“How dare you defend me to him?” shrieked Grushenka. “It wasn’t virtueyookept me pure, and it wasn’t that I was afraid of Kuzma, but that I mightyoohold up my head when I met him, and tell him he’s a scoundrel. And he didyooactually refuse the money?”yooyoo“He took it! He took it!” cried Mitya; “only he wanted to get the wholeyoothree thousand at once, and I could only give him seven hundred straightyoooff.”yooyoo“I see: he heard I had money, and came here to marry me!”yooyoo“_Pani_ Agrippina!” cried the little Pole. “I’m—a knight, I’m—a nobleman,yooand not a _lajdak_. I came here to make you my wife and I find you ayoodifferent woman, perverse and shameless.”yooyoo“Oh, go back where you came from! I’ll tell them to turn you out andyooyou’ll be turned out,” cried Grushenka, furious. “I’ve been a fool, ayoofool, to have been miserable these five years! And it wasn’t for his sake,yooit was my anger made me miserable. And this isn’t he at all! Was he likeyoothis? It might be his father! Where did you get your wig from? He was ayoofalcon, but this is a gander. He used to laugh and sing to me.... And I’veyoobeen crying for five years, damned fool, abject, shameless I was!”yooyooShe sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands. At thatyooinstant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left—ayoorollicking dance song.yooyoo“A regular Sodom!” Vrublevsky roared suddenly. “Landlord, send theyooshameless hussies away!”yooyooThe landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in atyoothe door, hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarreling, atyooonce entered the room.yooyoo“What are you shouting for? D’you want to split your throat?” he said,yooaddressing Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness.yooyoo“Animal!” bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.yooyoo“Animal? And what sort of cards were you playing with just now? I gave youyooa pack and you hid it. You played with marked cards! I could send you toyooSiberia for playing with false cards, d’you know that, for it’s just theyoosame as false banknotes....”yooyooAnd going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back andyoothe cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards.yooyoo“Here’s my pack unopened!”yooyooHe held it up and showed it to all in the room. “From where I stood I sawyoohim slip my pack away, and put his in place of it—you’re a cheat and not ayoogentleman!”yooyoo“And I twice saw the _pan_ change a card!” cried Kalganov.yooyoo“How shameful! How shameful!” exclaimed Grushenka, clasping her hands, andyooblushing for genuine shame. “Good Lord, he’s come to that!”yooyoo“I thought so, too!” said Mitya. But before he had uttered the words,yooVrublevsky, with a confused and infuriated face, shook his fist atyooGrushenka, shouting:yooyoo“You low harlot!”yooyooMitya flew at him at once, clutched him in both hands, lifted him in theyooair, and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right, fromyoowhich they had just come.yooyoo“I’ve laid him on the floor, there,” he announced, returning at once,yoogasping with excitement. “He’s struggling, the scoundrel! But he won’tyoocome back, no fear of that!...”yooyooHe closed one half of the folding doors, and holding the other ajar calledyooout to the little Pole:yooyoo“Most illustrious, will you be pleased to retire as well?”yooyoo“My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” said Trifon Borissovitch, “make them giveyooyou back the money you lost. It’s as good as stolen from you.”yooyoo“I don’t want my fifty roubles back,” Kalganov declared suddenly.yooyoo“I don’t want my two hundred, either,” cried Mitya, “I wouldn’t take ityoofor anything! Let him keep it as a consolation.”yooyoo“Bravo, Mitya! You’re a trump, Mitya!” cried Grushenka, and there was ayoonote of fierce anger in the exclamation.yooyooThe little _pan_, crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity, wasyoomaking for the door, but he stopped short and said suddenly, addressingyooGrushenka:yooyoo“_Pani_, if you want to come with me, come. If not, good-by.”yooyooAnd swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door. This wasyooa man of character: he had so good an opinion of himself that after allyoothat had passed, he still expected that she would marry him. Mitya slammedyoothe door after him.yooyoo“Lock it,” said Kalganov. But the key clicked on the other side, they hadyoolocked it from within.yooyoo“That’s capital!” exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. “Serve them right!”yooyooyooyooChapter VIII. DeliriumyooyooyooWhat followed was almost an orgy, a feast to which all were welcome.yooGrushenka was the first to call for wine.yooyoo“I want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before. Do youyooremember, Mitya, do you remember how we made friends here last time!”yooyooMitya himself was almost delirious, feeling that his happiness was atyoohand. But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her.yooyoo“Go and enjoy yourself. Tell them to dance, to make merry, ‘let the stoveyooand cottage dance’; as we had it last time,” she kept exclaiming. She wasyootremendously excited. And Mitya hastened to obey her. The chorus were inyoothe next room. The room in which they had been sitting till that momentyoowas too small, and was divided in two by cotton curtains, behind which wasyooa huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows.yooIn the four rooms for visitors there were beds. Grushenka settled herselfyoojust at the door. Mitya set an easy chair for her. She had sat in the sameyooplace to watch the dancing and singing “the time before,” when they hadyoomade merry there. All the girls who had come had been there then; theyooJewish band with fiddles and zithers had come, too, and at last the longyooexpected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions.yooyooMitya bustled about. All sorts of people began coming into the room toyoolook on, peasants and their women, who had been roused from sleep andyooattracted by the hopes of another marvelous entertainment such as they hadyooenjoyed a month before. Mitya remembered their faces, greeting andyooembracing every one he knew. He uncorked bottles and poured out wine foryooevery one who presented himself. Only the girls were very eager for theyoochampagne. The men preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot punch. Mityayoohad chocolate made for all the girls, and ordered that three samovarsyooshould be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone toyoohelp himself.yooyooAn absurd chaotic confusion followed, but Mitya was in his naturalyooelement, and the more foolish it became, the more his spirits rose. If theyoopeasants had asked him for money at that moment, he would have pulled outyoohis notes and given them away right and left. This was probably why theyoolandlord, Trifon Borissovitch, kept hovering about Mitya to protect him.yooHe seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night; but heyoodrank little, only one glass of punch, and kept a sharp look-out onyooMitya’s interests after his own fashion. He intervened in the nick ofyootime, civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away “cigarsyooand Rhine wine,” and, above all, money to the peasants as he had doneyoobefore. He was very indignant, too, at the peasant girls drinking liqueur,yooand eating sweets.yooyoo“They’re a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” he said. “I’d give them ayookick, every one of them, and they’d take it as an honor—that’s all they’reyooworth!”yooyooMitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent out to him. “Iyoowas rude to him just now,” he repeated with a sinking, softened voice.yooKalganov did not want to drink, and at first did not care for the girls’yoosinging; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne he becameyooextraordinarily lively, strolling about the room, laughing and praisingyoothe music and the songs, admiring every one and everything. Maximov,yooblissfully drunk, never left his side. Grushenka, too, was beginning toyooget drunk. Pointing to Kalganov, she said to Mitya:yooyoo“What a dear, charming boy he is!”yooyooAnd Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalganov and Maximov. Oh, great were hisyoohopes! She had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed, purposely to refrainyoofrom speaking. But she looked at him from time to time with caressing andyoopassionate eyes. At last she suddenly gripped his hand and drew himyoovigorously to her. She was sitting at the moment in the low chair by theyoodoor.yooyoo“How was it you came just now, eh? Have you walked in!... I wasyoofrightened. So you wanted to give me up to him, did you? Did you reallyyoowant to?”yooyoo“I didn’t want to spoil your happiness!” Mitya faltered blissfully. Butyooshe did not need his answer.yooyoo“Well, go and enjoy yourself ...” she sent him away once more. “Don’t cry,yooI’ll call you back again.”yooyooHe would run away, and she listened to the singing and looked at theyoodancing, though her eyes followed him wherever he went. But in anotheryooquarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would runyooback to her.yooyoo“Come, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and my comingyoohere yesterday? From whom did you first hear it?”yooyooAnd Mitya began telling her all about it, disconnectedly, incoherently,yoofeverishly. He spoke strangely, often frowning, and stopping abruptly.yooyoo“What are you frowning at?” she asked.yooyoo“Nothing.... I left a man ill there. I’d give ten years of my life for himyooto get well, to know he was all right!”yooyoo“Well, never mind him, if he’s ill. So you meant to shoot yourselfyooto-morrow! What a silly boy! What for? I like such reckless fellows asyooyou,” she lisped, with a rather halting tongue. “So you would go anyyoolength for me, eh? Did you really mean to shoot yourself to-morrow, youyoostupid? No, wait a little. To-morrow I may have something to say toyooyou.... I won’t say it to-day, but to-morrow. You’d like it to be to-day?yooNo, I don’t want to to-day. Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself.”yooyooOnce, however, she called him, as it were, puzzled and uneasy.yooyoo“Why are you sad? I see you’re sad.... Yes, I see it,” she added, lookingyoointently into his eyes. “Though you keep kissing the peasants andyooshouting, I see something. No, be merry. I’m merry; you be merry, too....yooI love somebody here. Guess who it is. Ah, look, my boy has fallen asleep,yoopoor dear, he’s drunk.”yooyooShe meant Kalganov. He was, in fact, drunk, and had dropped asleep for ayoomoment, sitting on the sofa. But he was not merely drowsy from drink; heyoofelt suddenly dejected, or, as he said, “bored.” He was intenselyyoodepressed by the girls’ songs, which, as the drinking went on, graduallyyoobecame coarse and more reckless. And the dances were as bad. Two girlsyoodressed up as bears, and a lively girl, called Stepanida, with a stick inyooher hand, acted the part of keeper, and began to “show them.”yooyoo“Look alive, Marya, or you’ll get the stick!”yooyooThe bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion, amidyooroars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of men and women.yooyoo“Well, let them! Let them!” said Grushenka sententiously, with an ecstaticyooexpression on her face. “When they do get a day to enjoy themselves, whyyooshouldn’t folks be happy?”yooyooKalganov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt.yooyoo“It’s swinish, all this peasant foolery,” he murmured, moving away; “it’syoothe game they play when it’s light all night in summer.”yooyooHe particularly disliked one “new” song to a jaunty dance-tune. Ityoodescribed how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls, to seeyoowhether they would love him:yooyooyoo    The master came to try the girls:yoo    Would they love him, would they not?yooyooyooBut the girls could not love the master:yooyooyoo    He would beat me cruellyyoo    And such love won’t do for me.yooyooyooThen a gypsy comes along and he, too, tries:yooyooyoo    The gypsy came to try the girls:yoo    Would they love him, would they not?yooyooyooBut they couldn’t love the gypsy either:yooyooyoo    He would be a thief, I fear,yoo    And would cause me many a tear.yooyooyooAnd many more men come to try their luck, among them a soldier:yooyooyoo    The soldier came to try the girls:yoo    Would they love him, would they not?yooyooyooBut the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent lines, sungyoowith absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience. The songyooends with a merchant:yooyooyoo    The merchant came to try the girls:yoo    Would they love him, would they not?yooyooyooAnd it appears that he wins their love because:yooyooyoo    The merchant will make gold for meyoo    And his queen I’ll gladly be.yooyooyooKalvanov was positively indignant.yooyoo“That’s just a song of yesterday,” he said aloud. “Who writes such thingsyoofor them? They might just as well have had a railwayman or a Jew come toyootry his luck with the girls; they’d have carried all before them.”yooyooAnd, almost as though it were a personal affront, he declared, on theyoospot, that he was bored, sat down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.yooHis pretty little face looked rather pale, as it fell back on the sofayoocushion.yooyoo“Look how pretty he is,” said Grushenka, taking Mitya up to him. “I wasyoocombing his hair just now; his hair’s like flax, and so thick....”yooyooAnd, bending over him tenderly, she kissed his forehead. Kalganovyooinstantly opened his eyes, looked at her, stood up, and with the mostyooanxious air inquired where was Maximov?yooyoo“So that’s who it is you want.” Grushenka laughed. “Stay with me a minute.yooMitya, run and find his Maximov.”yooyooMaximov, it appeared, could not tear himself away from the girls, onlyyoorunning away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur. Heyoohad drunk two cups of chocolate. His face was red, and his nose wasyoocrimson; his eyes were moist and mawkishly sweet. He ran up and announcedyoothat he was going to dance the “sabotière.”yooyoo“They taught me all those well-bred, aristocratic dances when I wasyoolittle....”yooyoo“Go, go with him, Mitya, and I’ll watch from here how he dances,” saidyooGrushenka.yooyoo“No, no, I’m coming to look on, too,” exclaimed Kalganov, brushing asideyooin the most naïve way Grushenka’s offer to sit with him. They all went toyoolook on. Maximov danced his dance. But it roused no great admiration inyooany one but Mitya. It consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping,yookicking up the feet, and at every skip Maximov slapped the upturned soleyooof his foot. Kalganov did not like it at all, but Mitya kissed the dancer.yooyoo“Thanks. You’re tired perhaps? What are you looking for here? Would youyoolike some sweets? A cigar, perhaps?”yooyoo“A cigarette.”yooyoo“Don’t you want a drink?”yooyoo“I’ll just have a liqueur.... Have you any chocolates?”yooyoo“Yes, there’s a heap of them on the table there. Choose one, my dearyoosoul!”yooyoo“I like one with vanilla ... for old people. He he!”yooyoo“No, brother, we’ve none of that special sort.”yooyoo“I say,” the old man bent down to whisper in Mitya’s ear. “That girlyoothere, little Marya, he he! How would it be if you were to help me makeyoofriends with her?”yooyoo“So that’s what you’re after! No, brother, that won’t do!”yooyoo“I’d do no harm to any one,” Maximov muttered disconsolately.yooyoo“Oh, all right, all right. They only come here to dance and sing, youyooknow, brother. But damn it all, wait a bit!... Eat and drink and be merry,yoomeanwhile. Don’t you want money?”yooyoo“Later on, perhaps,” smiled Maximov.yooyoo“All right, all right....”yooyooMitya’s head was burning. He went outside to the wooden balcony which ranyooround the whole building on the inner side, overlooking the courtyard. Theyoofresh air revived him. He stood alone in a dark corner, and suddenlyyooclutched his head in both hands. His scattered thoughts came together; hisyoosensations blended into a whole and threw a sudden light into his mind. Ayoofearful and terrible light! “If I’m to shoot myself, why not now?” passedyoothrough his mind. “Why not go for the pistols, bring them here, and here,yooin this dark dirty corner, make an end?” Almost a minute he stood,yooundecided. A few hours earlier, when he had been dashing here, he wasyoopursued by disgrace, by the theft he had committed, and that blood, thatyooblood!... But yet it was easier for him then. Then everything was over: heyoohad lost her, given her up. She was gone, for him—oh, then his deathyoosentence had been easier for him; at least it had seemed necessary,yooinevitable, for what had he to stay on earth for?yooyooBut now? Was it the same as then? Now one phantom, one terror at least wasyooat an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful figure had vanished,yooleaving no trace. The terrible phantom had turned into something so small,yooso comic; it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in. It wouldyoonever return. She was ashamed, and from her eyes he could see now whom sheyooloved. Now he had everything to make life happy ... but he could not go onyooliving, he could not; oh, damnation! “O God! restore to life the man Iyooknocked down at the fence! Let this fearful cup pass from me! Lord, thouyoohast wrought miracles for such sinners as me! But what, what if the oldyooman’s alive? Oh, then the shame of the other disgrace I would wipe away. Iyoowould restore the stolen money. I’d give it back; I’d get it somehow....yooNo trace of that shame will remain except in my heart for ever! But no,yoono; oh, impossible cowardly dreams! Oh, damnation!”yooyooYet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness. He jumped up andyooran back to the room—to her, to her, his queen for ever! Was not oneyoomoment of her love worth all the rest of life, even in the agonies ofyoodisgrace? This wild question clutched at his heart. “To her, to her alone,yooto see her, to hear her, to think of nothing, to forget everything, ifyooonly for that night, for an hour, for a moment!” Just as he turned fromyoothe balcony into the passage, he came upon the landlord, TrifonyooBorissovitch. He thought he looked gloomy and worried, and fancied he hadyoocome to find him.yooyoo“What is it, Trifon Borissovitch? are you looking for me?”yooyoo“No, sir.” The landlord seemed disconcerted. “Why should I be looking foryooyou? Where have you been?”yooyoo“Why do you look so glum? You’re not angry, are you? Wait a bit, you shallyoosoon get to bed.... What’s the time?”yooyoo“It’ll be three o’clock. Past three, it must be.”yooyoo“We’ll leave off soon. We’ll leave off.”yooyoo“Don’t mention it; it doesn’t matter. Keep it up as long as you like....”yooyoo“What’s the matter with him?” Mitya wondered for an instant, and he ranyooback to the room where the girls were dancing. But she was not there. Sheyoowas not in the blue room either; there was no one but Kalganov asleep onyoothe sofa. Mitya peeped behind the curtain—she was there. She was sittingyooin the corner, on a trunk. Bent forward, with her head and arms on the bedyooclose by, she was crying bitterly, doing her utmost to stifle her sobsyoothat she might not be heard. Seeing Mitya, she beckoned him to her, andyoowhen he ran to her, she grasped his hand tightly.yooyoo“Mitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him these fiveyooyears, all that time! Did I love him or only my own anger? No, him, him!yooIt’s a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him. Mitya, I was onlyyooseventeen then; he was so kind to me, so merry; he used to sing to me....yooOr so it seemed to a silly girl like me.... And now, O Lord, it’s not theyoosame man. Even his face is not the same; he’s different altogether. Iyooshouldn’t have known him. I drove here with Timofey, and all the way I wasyoothinking how I should meet him, what I should say to him, how we shouldyoolook at one another. My soul was faint, and all of a sudden it was just asyoothough he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me. He talked to me likeyooa schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he met me so solemnly that I wasyoostruck dumb. I couldn’t get a word in. At first I thought he was ashamedyooto talk before his great big Pole. I sat staring at him and wondering whyyooI couldn’t say a word to him now. It must have been his wife that ruinedyoohim; you know he threw me up to get married. She must have changed himyoolike that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I’m ashamed, I’m ashamedyoofor all my life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five years!”yooyooAnd again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya’s hand and didyoonot let it go.yooyoo“Mitya, darling, stay, don’t go away. I want to say one word to you,” sheyoowhispered, and suddenly raised her face to him. “Listen, tell me who it isyooI love? I love one man here. Who is that man? That’s what you must tellyoome.”yooyooA smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping, and her eyesyooshone in the half darkness.yooyoo“A falcon flew in, and my heart sank. ‘Fool! that’s the man you love!’yooThat was what my heart whispered to me at once. You came in and all grewyoobright. What’s he afraid of? I wondered. For you were frightened; youyoocouldn’t speak. It’s not them he’s afraid of—could you be frightened ofyooany one? It’s me he’s afraid of, I thought, only me. So Fenya told you,yooyou little stupid, how I called to Alyosha out of the window that I’dyooloved Mityenka for one hour, and that I was going now to love ... another.yooMitya, Mitya, how could I be such a fool as to think I could love any oneyooafter you? Do you forgive me, Mitya? Do you forgive me or not? Do you loveyoome? Do you love me?” She jumped up and held him with both hands on hisyooshoulders. Mitya, dumb with rapture, gazed into her eyes, at her face, atyooher smile, and suddenly clasped her tightly in his arms and kissed heryoopassionately.yooyoo“You will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through spite Iyootormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out of hisyoomind.... Do you remember how you drank at my house one day and broke theyoowine-glass? I remembered that and I broke a glass to-day and drank ‘to myyoovile heart.’ Mitya, my falcon, why don’t you kiss me? He kissed me once,yooand now he draws back and looks and listens. Why listen to me? Kiss me,yookiss me hard, that’s right. If you love, well, then, love! I’ll be youryooslave now, your slave for the rest of my life. It’s sweet to be a slave.yooKiss me! Beat me, ill-treat me, do what you will with me.... And I doyoodeserve to suffer. Stay, wait, afterwards, I won’t have that....” sheyoosuddenly thrust him away. “Go along, Mitya, I’ll come and have some wine,yooI want to be drunk, I’m going to get drunk and dance; I must, I must!” Sheyootore herself away from him and disappeared behind the curtain. Mityayoofollowed like a drunken man.yooyoo“Yes, come what may—whatever may happen now, for one minute I’d give theyoowhole world,” he thought. Grushenka did, in fact, toss off a whole glassyooof champagne at one gulp, and became at once very tipsy. She sat down inyoothe same chair as before, with a blissful smile on her face. Her cheeksyoowere glowing, her lips were burning, her flashing eyes were moist; thereyoowas passionate appeal in her eyes. Even Kalganov felt a stir at the heartyooand went up to her.yooyoo“Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now?” she saidyoothickly. “I’m drunk now, that’s what it is.... And aren’t you drunk? Andyoowhy isn’t Mitya drinking? Why don’t you drink, Mitya? I’m drunk, and youyoodon’t drink....”yooyoo“I am drunk! I’m drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and now I’ll beyoodrunk with wine, too.”yooyooHe drank off another glass, and—he thought it strange himself—that glassyoomade him completely drunk. He was suddenly drunk, although till thatyoomoment he had been quite sober, he remembered that. From that momentyooeverything whirled about him, as though he were delirious. He walked,yoolaughed, talked to everybody, without knowing what he was doing. Only oneyoopersistent burning sensation made itself felt continually, “like a red-hotyoocoal in his heart,” he said afterwards. He went up to her, sat beside her,yoogazed at her, listened to her.... She became very talkative, kept callingyooevery one to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. Whenyoothe girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of the crossyooover her. In another minute she might have cried. She was greatly amusedyooby the “little old man,” as she called Maximov. He ran up every minute toyookiss her hands, “each little finger,” and finally he danced another danceyooto an old song, which he sang himself. He danced with special vigor to theyoorefrain:yooyooyoo    The little pig says—umph! umph! umph!yoo    The little calf says—moo, moo, moo,yoo    The little duck says—quack, quack, quack,yoo    The little goose says—ga, ga, ga.yoo    The hen goes strutting through the porch;yoo    Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she’ll say,yoo    Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she’ll say!yooyooyoo“Give him something, Mitya,” said Grushenka. “Give him a present, he’syoopoor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!... Do you know, Mitya, I shallyoogo into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day, Alyosha said something toyoome to-day that I shall remember all my life.... Yes.... But to-day let usyoodance. To-morrow to the nunnery, but to-day we’ll dance. I want to playyooto-day, good people, and what of it? God will forgive us. If I were God,yooI’d forgive every one: ‘My dear sinners, from this day forth I forgiveyooyou.’ I’m going to beg forgiveness: ‘Forgive me, good people, a sillyyoowench.’ I’m a beast, that’s what I am. But I want to pray. I gave a littleyooonion. Wicked as I’ve been, I want to pray. Mitya, let them dance, don’tyoostop them. Every one in the world is good. Every one—even the worst ofyoothem. The world’s a nice place. Though we’re bad the world’s all right.yooWe’re good and bad, good and bad.... Come, tell me, I’ve something to askyooyou: come here every one, and I’ll ask you: Why am I so good? You know Iyooam good. I’m very good.... Come, why am I so good?”yooyooSo Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk. At last sheyooannounced that she was going to dance, too. She got up from her chair,yoostaggering. “Mitya, don’t give me any more wine—if I ask you, don’t giveyooit to me. Wine doesn’t give peace. Everything’s going round, the stove,yooand everything. I want to dance. Let every one see how I dance ... letyoothem see how beautifully I dance....”yooyooShe really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of heryoopocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave it in theyoodance. Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and got ready to breakyoointo a dancing song at the first signal. Maximov, hearing that Grushenkayoowanted to dance, squealed with delight, and ran skipping about in front ofyooher, humming:yooyooyoo    With legs so slim and sides so trimyoo    And its little tail curled tight.yooyooyooBut Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away.yooyoo“Sh-h! Mitya, why don’t they come? Let every one come ... to look on. Callyoothem in, too, that were locked in.... Why did you lock them in? Tell themyooI’m going to dance. Let them look on, too....”yooyooMitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door, and began knockingyooto the Poles with his fist.yooyoo“Hi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, she’s going to dance. She calls you.”yooyoo“_Lajdak!_” one of the Poles shouted in reply.yooyoo“You’re a _lajdak_ yourself! You’re a little scoundrel, that’s what youyooare.”yooyoo“Leave off laughing at Poland,” said Kalganov sententiously. He too wasyoodrunk.yooyoo“Be quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, it doesn’t mean that I calledyooall Poland so. One _lajdak_ doesn’t make a Poland. Be quiet, my prettyyooboy, eat a sweetmeat.”yooyoo“Ach, what fellows! As though they were not men. Why won’t they makeyoofriends?” said Grushenka, and went forward to dance. The chorus broke intoyoo“Ah, my porch, my new porch!” Grushenka flung back her head, half openedyooher lips, smiled, waved her handkerchief, and suddenly, with a violentyoolurch, stood still in the middle of the room, looking bewildered.yooyoo“I’m weak....” she said in an exhausted voice. “Forgive me.... I’m weak, Iyoocan’t.... I’m sorry.”yooyooShe bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all directions.yooyoo“I’m sorry.... Forgive me....”yooyoo“The lady’s been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,” voices wereyooheard saying.yooyoo“The lady’s drunk too much,” Maximov explained to the girls, giggling.yooyoo“Mitya, lead me away ... take me,” said Grushenka helplessly. Mityayoopounced on her, snatched her up in his arms, and carried the preciousyooburden through the curtains.yooyoo“Well, now I’ll go,” thought Kalganov, and walking out of the blue room,yoohe closed the two halves of the door after him. But the orgy in the largeryooroom went on and grew louder and louder. Mitya laid Grushenka on the bedyooand kissed her on the lips.yooyoo“Don’t touch me....” she faltered, in an imploring voice. “Don’t touch me,yootill I’m yours.... I’ve told you I’m yours, but don’t touch me ... spareyoome.... With them here, with them close, you mustn’t. He’s here. It’s nastyyoohere....”yooyoo“I’ll obey you! I won’t think of it ... I worship you!” muttered Mitya.yoo“Yes, it’s nasty here, it’s abominable.”yooyooAnd still holding her in his arms, he sank on his knees by the bedside.yooyoo“I know, though you’re a brute, you’re generous,” Grushenka articulatedyoowith difficulty. “It must be honorable ... it shall be honorable for theyoofuture ... and let us be honest, let us be good, not brutes, but good ...yootake me away, take me far away, do you hear? I don’t want it to be here,yoobut far, far away....”yooyoo“Oh, yes, yes, it must be!” said Mitya, pressing her in his arms. “I’llyootake you and we’ll fly away.... Oh, I’d give my whole life for one yearyooonly to know about that blood!”yooyoo“What blood?” asked Grushenka, bewildered.yooyoo“Nothing,” muttered Mitya, through his teeth. “Grusha, you wanted to beyoohonest, but I’m a thief. But I’ve stolen money from Katya.... Disgrace, ayoodisgrace!”yooyoo“From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn’t steal it. Give it heryooback, take it from me.... Why make a fuss? Now everything of mine isyooyours. What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway.... Folks like usyooare bound to waste money. But we’d better go and work the land. I want toyoodig the earth with my own hands. We must work, do you hear? Alyosha saidyooso. I won’t be your mistress, I’ll be faithful to you, I’ll be your slave,yooI’ll work for you. We’ll go to the young lady and bow down to heryootogether, so that she may forgive us, and then we’ll go away. And if sheyoowon’t forgive us, we’ll go, anyway. Take her her money and love me....yooDon’t love her.... Don’t love her any more. If you love her, I shallyoostrangle her.... I’ll put out both her eyes with a needle....”yooyoo“I love you. I love only you. I’ll love you in Siberia....”yooyoo“Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don’t care ... we’llyoowork ... there’s snow in Siberia.... I love driving in the snow ... andyoomust have bells.... Do you hear, there’s a bell ringing? Where is thatyoobell ringing? There are people coming.... Now it’s stopped.”yooyooShe closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an instant.yooThere had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance, but theyooringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on her breast. He did notyoonotice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor did he notice that the songsyoohad ceased, and that instead of singing and drunken clamor there wasyooabsolute stillness in the house. Grushenka opened her eyes.yooyoo“What’s the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ... a bell ... I’ve been asleep andyoodreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and I dozed. I was withyoosome one I loved, with you. And far, far away. I was holding you andyookissing you, nestling close to you. I was cold, and the snow glistened....yooYou know how the snow glistens at night when the moon shines. It was asyoothough I was not on earth. I woke up, and my dear one is close to me. Howyoosweet that is!...”yooyoo“Close to you,” murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom, her hands.yooAnd suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him that she was lookingyoostraight before her, not at him, not into his face, but over his head,yoowith an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An expression of wonder, almost ofyooalarm, came suddenly into her face.yooyoo“Mitya, who is that looking at us?” she whispered.yooyooMitya turned, and saw that some one had, in fact, parted the curtains andyooseemed to be watching them. And not one person alone, it seemed.yooyooHe jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.yooyoo“Here, come to us, come here,” said a voice, speaking not loudly, butyoofirmly and peremptorily.yooyooMitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still. Theyooroom was filled with people, but not those who had been there before. Anyooinstantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he shuddered. He recognizedyooall those people instantly. That tall, stout old man in the overcoat andyooforage-cap with a cockade—was the police captain, Mihail Makarovitch. Andyoothat “consumptive-looking” trim dandy, “who always has such polishedyooboots”—that was the deputy prosecutor. “He has a chronometer worth fouryoohundred roubles; he showed it to me.” And that small young man inyoospectacles.... Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him, had seen him:yoohe was the “investigating lawyer,” from the “school of jurisprudence,” whoyoohad only lately come to the town. And this man—the inspector of police,yooMavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he knew well. And those fellows with theyoobrass plates on, why are they here? And those other two ... peasants....yooAnd there at the door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch....yooyoo“Gentlemen! What’s this for, gentlemen?” began Mitya, but suddenly, asyoothough beside himself, not knowing what he was doing, he cried aloud, atyoothe top of his voice:yooyoo“I un—der—stand!”yooyooThe young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping up toyooMitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:yooyoo“We have to make ... in brief, I beg you to come this way, this way to theyoosofa.... It is absolutely imperative that you should give an explanation.”yooyoo“The old man!” cried Mitya frantically. “The old man and his blood!... Iyoounderstand.”yooyooAnd he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had been mownyoodown by a scythe.yooyoo“You understand? He understands it! Monster and parricide! Your father’syooblood cries out against you!” the old captain of police roared suddenly,yoostepping up to Mitya.yooyooHe was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all over.yooyoo“This is impossible!” cried the small young man. “Mihail Makarovitch,yooMihail Makarovitch, this won’t do!... I beg you’ll allow me to speak. Iyooshould never have expected such behavior from you....”yooyoo“This is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium,” cried the captain ofyoopolice; “look at him: drunk, at this time of night, in the company of ayoodisreputable woman, with the blood of his father on his hands.... It’syoodelirium!...”yooyoo“I beg you most earnestly, dear Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain youryoofeelings,” the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old policeyoocaptain, “or I shall be forced to resort to—”yooyooBut the little lawyer did not allow him to finish. He turned to Mitya, andyoodelivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:yooyoo“Ex-Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that you are chargedyoowith the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, perpetratedyoothis night....”yooyooHe said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in something, butyoothough Mitya heard them he did not understand them. He stared at them allyoowith wild eyes.yooyooyooyooyooBook IX. The Preliminary InvestigationyooyooyooyooChapter I. The Beginning Of Perhotin’s Official CareeryooyooyooPyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whom we left knocking at the strong locked gatesyooof the widow Morozov’s house, ended, of course, by making himself heard.yooFenya, who was still excited by the fright she had had two hours before,yooand too much “upset” to go to bed, was almost frightened into hysterics onyoohearing the furious knocking at the gate. Though she had herself seen himyoodrive away, she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knockingyooagain, no one else could knock so savagely. She ran to the house-porter,yoowho had already waked up and gone out to the gate, and began imploring himyoonot to open it. But having questioned Pyotr Ilyitch, and learned that heyoowanted to see Fenya on very “important business,” the man made up his mindyooat last to open. Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenya’s kitchen, but theyoogirl begged him to allow the house-porter to be present, “because of heryoomisgivings.” He began questioning her and at once learnt the most vitalyoofact, that is, that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look foryooGrushenka, he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar, and that when heyooreturned, the pestle was not with him and his hands were smeared withyooblood.yooyoo“And the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him, dripping!” Fenyayookept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the product of heryoodisordered imagination. But although not “dripping,” Pyotr Ilyitch hadyoohimself seen those hands stained with blood, and had helped to wash them.yooMoreover, the question he had to decide was not how soon the blood hadyoodried, but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle, or rather,yoowhether it really was to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, and how he couldyoosatisfactorily ascertain. Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to thisyoopoint, and though he found out nothing conclusive, yet he carried away ayooconviction that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to hisyoofather’s house, and that therefore something must have happened there.yooyoo“And when he came back,” Fenya added with excitement, “I told him theyoowhole story, and then I began asking him, ‘Why have you got blood on youryoohands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?’ and he answered that that was human blood,yooand that he had just killed some one. He confessed it all to me, andyoosuddenly ran off like a madman. I sat down and began thinking, where’s heyoorun off to now like a madman? He’ll go to Mokroe, I thought, and kill myyoomistress there. I ran out to beg him not to kill her. I was running to hisyoolodgings, but I looked at Plotnikov’s shop, and saw him just setting off,yooand there was no blood on his hands then.” (Fenya had noticed this andyooremembered it.) Fenya’s old grandmother confirmed her evidence as far asyooshe was capable. After asking some further questions, Pyotr Ilyitch leftyoothe house, even more upset and uneasy than he had been when he entered it.yooyooThe most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have been to goyoostraight to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, to find out whether anything had happenedyoothere, and if so, what; and only to go to the police captain, as PyotryooIlyitch firmly intended doing, when he had satisfied himself of the fact.yooBut the night was dark, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s gates were strong, and heyoowould have to knock again. His acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was ofyoothe slightest, and what if, after he had been knocking, they opened toyoohim, and nothing had happened? Then Fyodor Pavlovitch in his jeering wayyoowould go telling the story all over the town, how a stranger, calledyooPerhotin, had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if any one had killedyoohim. It would make a scandal. And scandal was what Pyotr Ilyitch dreadedyoomore than anything in the world.yooyooYet the feeling that possessed him was so strong, that though he stampedyoohis foot angrily and swore at himself, he set off again, not to FyodoryooPavlovitch’s but to Madame Hohlakov’s. He decided that if she deniedyoohaving just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand roubles, he would goyoostraight to the police captain, but if she admitted having given him theyoomoney, he would go home and let the matter rest till next morning.yooyooIt is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood ofyoocausing scandal by going at eleven o’clock at night to a fashionable lady,yooa complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her from her bed to ask her anyooamazing question, than by going to Fyodor Pavlovitch. But that is just howyooit is, sometimes, especially in cases like the present one, with theyoodecisions of the most precise and phlegmatic people. Pyotr Ilyitch was byyoono means phlegmatic at that moment. He remembered all his life how ayoohaunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him, growing more andyoomore painful and driving him on, against his will. Yet he kept cursingyoohimself, of course, all the way for going to this lady, but “I will get toyoothe bottom of it, I will!” he repeated for the tenth time, grinding hisyooteeth, and he carried out his intention.yooyooIt was exactly eleven o’clock when he entered Madame Hohlakov’s house. Heyoowas admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in response to his inquiryyoowhether the lady was still up, the porter could give no answer, exceptyoothat she was usually in bed by that time.yooyoo“Ask at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you, she’llyooreceive you. If she won’t, she won’t.”yooyooPyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The footmanyoowas unwilling to take in his name, but finally called a maid. PyotryooIlyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady that anyooofficial, living in the town, called Perhotin, had called on particularyoobusiness, and that if it were not of the greatest importance he would notyoohave ventured to come. “Tell her in those words, in those words exactly,”yoohe asked the girl.yooyooShe went away. He remained waiting in the entry. Madame Hohlakov herselfyoowas already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep. She had felt upset everyoosince Mitya’s visit, and had a presentiment that she would not get throughyoothe night without the sick headache which always, with her, followed suchyooexcitement. She was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid.yooShe irritably declined to see him, however, though the unexpected visit atyoosuch an hour, of an “official living in the town,” who was a totalyoostranger, roused her feminine curiosity intensely. But this time PyotryooIlyitch was as obstinate as a mule. He begged the maid most earnestly toyootake another message in these very words:yooyoo“That he had come on business of the greatest importance, and that MadameyooHohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she refused to see himyoonow.”yooyoo“I plunged headlong,” he described it afterwards.yooyooThe maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message again.yooMadame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little, asked what he lookedyoolike, and learned that he was “very well dressed, young and so polite.” Weyoomay note, parenthetically, that Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good-lookingyooyoung man, and well aware of the fact. Madame Hohlakov made up her mind toyoosee him. She was in her dressing-gown and slippers, but she flung a blackyooshawl over her shoulders. “The official” was asked to walk into theyoodrawing-room, the very room in which Mitya had been received shortlyyoobefore. The lady came to meet her visitor, with a sternly inquiringyoocountenance, and, without asking him to sit down, began at once with theyooquestion:yooyoo“What do you want?”yooyoo“I have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning our commonyooacquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,” Perhotin began.yooyooBut he had hardly uttered the name, when the lady’s face showed signs ofyooacute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him in a fury:yooyoo“How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?” she criedyoohysterically. “How dare you, sir, how could you venture to disturb a ladyyoowho is a stranger to you, in her own house at such an hour!... And toyooforce yourself upon her to talk of a man who came here, to this veryyoodrawing-room, only three hours ago, to murder me, and went stamping out ofyoothe room, as no one would go out of a decent house. Let me tell you, sir,yoothat I shall lodge a complaint against you, that I will not let it pass.yooKindly leave me at once.... I am a mother.... I ... I—”yooyoo“Murder! then he tried to murder you, too?”yooyoo“Why, has he killed somebody else?” Madame Hohlakov asked impulsively.yooyoo“If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I’ll explain it allyooin a couple of words,” answered Perhotin, firmly. “At five o’clock thisyooafternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles from me, and I know foryooa fact he had no money. Yet at nine o’clock, he came to see me with ayoobundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand, about two or three thousandyooroubles. His hands and face were all covered with blood, and he lookedyoolike a madman. When I asked him where he had got so much money, heyooanswered that he had just received it from you, that you had given him ayoosum of three thousand to go to the gold-mines....”yooyooMadame Hohlakov’s face assumed an expression of intense and painfulyooexcitement.yooyoo“Good God! He must have killed his old father!” she cried, clasping heryoohands. “I have never given him money, never! Oh, run, run!... Don’t sayyooanother word! Save the old man ... run to his father ... run!”yooyoo“Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You remember for ayoofact that you did not give him any money?”yooyoo“No, I didn’t, I didn’t! I refused to give it him, for he could notyooappreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me, but Iyooslipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide nothing from youyoonow, that he positively spat at me. Can you fancy that! But why are weyoostanding? Ah, sit down.”yooyoo“Excuse me, I....”yooyoo“Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man from an awfulyoodeath!”yooyoo“But if he has killed him already?”yooyoo“Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What do you think weyoomust do now?”yooyooMeantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down herself, facingyoohim. Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told her the history ofyoothe affair, that part of it at least which he had himself witnessed. Heyoodescribed, too, his visit to Fenya, and told her about the pestle. Allyoothese details produced an overwhelming effect on the distracted lady, whoyookept uttering shrieks, and covering her face with her hands....yooyoo“Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special faculty,yoowhatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I’ve looked at that awfulyooman and always thought, that man will end by murdering me. And now it’syoohappened ... that is, if he hasn’t murdered me, but only his own father,yooit’s only because the finger of God preserved me, and what’s more, he wasyooashamed to murder me because, in this very place, I put the holy ikon fromyoothe relics of the holy martyr, Saint Varvara, on his neck.... And to thinkyoohow near I was to death at that minute, I went close up to him and heyoostretched out his neck to me!... Do you know, Pyotr Ilyitch (I think youyoosaid your name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I don’t believe in miracles, but thatyooikon and this unmistakable miracle with me now—that shakes me, and I’myooready to believe in anything you like. Have you heard about FatheryooZossima?... But I don’t know what I’m saying ... and only fancy, with theyooikon on his neck he spat at me.... He only spat, it’s true, he didn’tyoomurder me and ... he dashed away! But what shall we do, what must we doyoonow? What do you think?”yooyooPyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight to theyoopolice captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to do what heyoothought fit.yooyoo“Oh, he’s an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I know him. Ofyoocourse, he’s the person to go to. How practical you are, Pyotr Ilyitch!yooHow well you’ve thought of everything! I should never have thought of ityooin your place!”yooyoo“Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,” observed PyotryooIlyitch, who still continued to stand, and was obviously anxious to escapeyooas quickly as possible from the impulsive lady, who would not let him sayyoogood-by and go away.yooyoo“And be sure, be sure,” she prattled on, “to come back and tell me whatyooyou see there, and what you find out ... what comes to light ... howyoothey’ll try him ... and what he’s condemned to.... Tell me, we have noyoocapital punishment, have we? But be sure to come, even if it’s at threeyooo’clock at night, at four, at half-past four.... Tell them to wake me, toyoowake me, to shake me, if I don’t get up.... But, good heavens, I shan’tyoosleep! But wait, hadn’t I better come with you?”yooyoo“N—no. But if you would write three lines with your own hand, stating thatyooyou did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it might, perhaps, be of useyoo... in case it’s needed....”yooyoo“To be sure!” Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her bureau. “And youyooknow I’m simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness, your good sense inyoosuch affairs. Are you in the service here? I’m delighted to think thatyooyou’re in the service here!”yooyooAnd still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper theyoofollowing lines:yooyooyoo    I’ve never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitriyoo    Fyodorovitch Karamazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy),yoo    three thousand roubles to-day. I’ve never given him money, never:yoo    That I swear by all that’s holy!yooyoo    K. HOHLAKOV.yooyooyoo“Here’s the note!” she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch. “Go, save him.yooIt’s a noble deed on your part!”yooyooAnd she made the sign of the cross three times over him. She ran out toyooaccompany him to the passage.yooyoo“How grateful I am to you! You can’t think how grateful I am to you foryoohaving come to me, first. How is it I haven’t met you before? I shall feelyooflattered at seeing you at my house in the future. How delightful it isyoothat you are living here!... Such precision! Such practical ability!...yooThey must appreciate you, they must understand you. If there’s anything Iyoocan do, believe me ... oh, I love young people! I’m in love with youngyoopeople! The younger generation are the one prop of our suffering country.yooHer one hope.... Oh, go, go!...”yooyooBut Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she would not have let him go soyoosoon. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable impression on him,yoowhich had somewhat softened his anxiety at being drawn into such anyoounpleasant affair. Tastes differ, as we all know. “She’s by no means soyooelderly,” he thought, feeling pleased, “on the contrary I should haveyootaken her for her daughter.”yooyooAs for Madame Hohlakov, she was simply enchanted by the young man. “Suchyoosense! such exactness! in so young a man! in our day! and all that withyoosuch manners and appearance! People say the young people of to-day are noyoogood for anything, but here’s an example!” etc. So she simply forgot thisyoo“dreadful affair,” and it was only as she was getting into bed, that,yoosuddenly recalling “how near death she had been,” she exclaimed: “Ah, ityoois awful, awful!”yooyooBut she fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep.yooyooI would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant details,yooif this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by no meansyooelderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the foundation of theyoowhole career of that practical and precise young man. His story isyooremembered to this day with amazement in our town, and I shall perhapsyoohave something to say about it, when I have finished my long history ofyoothe Brothers Karamazov.yooyooyooyooChapter II. The AlarmyooyooyooOur police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retiredyoolieutenant-colonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He had only comeyooto us three years previously, but had won general esteem, chiefly becauseyoohe “knew how to keep society together.” He was never without visitors, andyoocould not have got on without them. Some one or other was always diningyoowith him; he never sat down to table without guests. He gave regularyoodinners, too, on all sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising ones.yooThough the fare was not _recherché_, it was abundant. The fish-pies wereyooexcellent, and the wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality.yooyooThe first room his guests entered was a well-fitted billiard-room, withyoopictures of English race-horses, in black frames on the walls, anyooessential decoration, as we all know, for a bachelor’s billiard-room.yooThere was card-playing every evening at his house, if only at one table.yooBut at frequent intervals, all the society of our town, with the mammasyooand young ladies, assembled at his house to dance. Though MihailyooMakarovitch was a widower, he did not live alone. His widowed daughteryoolived with him, with her two unmarried daughters, grown-up girls, who hadyoofinished their education. They were of agreeable appearance and livelyyoocharacter, and though every one knew they would have no dowry, theyyooattracted all the young men of fashion to their grandfather’s house.yooyooMihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work, though heyooperformed his duties no worse than many others. To speak plainly, he was ayooman of rather narrow education. His understanding of the limits of hisyooadministrative power could not always be relied upon. It was not so muchyoothat he failed to grasp certain reforms enacted during the present reign,yooas that he made conspicuous blunders in his interpretation of them. Thisyoowas not from any special lack of intelligence, but from carelessness, foryoohe was always in too great a hurry to go into the subject.yooyoo“I have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian,” he used to sayyooof himself. He had not even formed a definite idea of the fundamentalyooprinciples of the reforms connected with the emancipation of the serfs,yooand only picked it up, so to speak, from year to year, involuntarilyyooincreasing his knowledge by practice. And yet he was himself a landowner.yooPyotr Ilyitch knew for certain that he would meet some of MihailyooMakarovitch’s visitors there that evening, but he didn’t know which. As ityoohappened, at that moment the prosecutor, and Varvinsky, our districtyoodoctor, a young man, who had only just come to us from Petersburg afteryootaking a brilliant degree at the Academy of Medicine, were playing whistyooat the police captain’s. Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor (he wasyooreally the deputy prosecutor, but we always called him the prosecutor),yoowas rather a peculiar man, of about five and thirty, inclined to beyooconsumptive, and married to a fat and childless woman. He was vain andyooirritable, though he had a good intellect, and even a kind heart. Ityooseemed that all that was wrong with him was that he had a better opinionyooof himself than his ability warranted. And that made him seem constantlyyoouneasy. He had, moreover, certain higher, even artistic, leanings, towardsyoopsychology, for instance, a special study of the human heart, a specialyooknowledge of the criminal and his crime. He cherished a grievance on thisyooground, considering that he had been passed over in the service, and beingyoofirmly persuaded that in higher spheres he had not been properlyyooappreciated, and had enemies. In gloomy moments he even threatened to giveyooup his post, and practice as a barrister in criminal cases. The unexpectedyooKaramazov case agitated him profoundly: “It was a case that might well beyootalked about all over Russia.” But I am anticipating.yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer, who hadyooonly come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting in the next roomyoowith the young ladies. People talked about it afterwards and wondered thatyooall the gentlemen should, as though intentionally, on the evening of “theyoocrime” have been gathered together at the house of the executiveyooauthority. Yet it was perfectly simple and happened quite naturally.yooyooIppolit Kirillovitch’s wife had had toothache for the last two days, andyoohe was obliged to go out to escape from her groans. The doctor, from theyoovery nature of his being, could not spend an evening except at cards.yooNikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been intending for three days past toyoodrop in that evening at Mihail Makarovitch’s, so to speak casually, so asyooslyly to startle the eldest granddaughter, Olga Mihailovna, by showingyoothat he knew her secret, that he knew it was her birthday, and that sheyoowas trying to conceal it on purpose, so as not to be obliged to give ayoodance. He anticipated a great deal of merriment, many playful jests aboutyooher age, and her being afraid to reveal it, about his knowing her secretyooand telling everybody, and so on. The charming young man was a great adeptyooat such teasing; the ladies had christened him “the naughty man,” and heyooseemed to be delighted at the name. He was extremely well-bred, however,yooof good family, education and feelings, and, though leading a life ofyoopleasure, his sallies were always innocent and in good taste. He wasyooshort, and delicate-looking. On his white, slender, little fingers heyooalways wore a number of big, glittering rings. When he was engaged in hisyooofficial duties, he always became extraordinarily grave, as thoughyoorealizing his position and the sanctity of the obligations laid upon him.yooHe had a special gift for mystifying murderers and other criminals of theyoopeasant class during interrogation, and if he did not win their respect,yoohe certainly succeeded in arousing their wonder.yooyooPyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the policeyoocaptain’s. He saw instantly that every one knew. They had positivelyyoothrown down their cards, all were standing up and talking. Even NikolayyooParfenovitch had left the young ladies and run in, looking strenuous andyooready for action. Pyotr Ilyitch was met with the astounding news that oldyooFyodor Pavlovitch really had been murdered that evening in his own house,yoomurdered and robbed. The news had only just reached them in the followingyoomanner.yooyooMarfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked senselessyoonear the fence, was sleeping soundly in her bed and might well have sleptyootill morning after the draught she had taken. But, all of a sudden sheyoowaked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic scream from Smerdyakov,yoowho was lying in the next room unconscious. That scream always precededyoohis fits, and always terrified and upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could neveryooget accustomed to it. She jumped up and ran half-awake to Smerdyakov’syooroom. But it was dark there, and she could only hear the invalid beginningyooto gasp and struggle. Then Marfa Ignatyevna herself screamed out and wasyoogoing to call her husband, but suddenly realized that when she had got up,yoohe was not beside her in bed. She ran back to the bedstead and beganyoogroping with her hands, but the bed was really empty. Then he must haveyoogone out—where? She ran to the steps and timidly called him. She got noyooanswer, of course, but she caught the sound of groans far away in theyoogarden in the darkness. She listened. The groans were repeated, and it wasyooevident they came from the garden.yooyoo“Good Lord! Just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya!” she thoughtyoodistractedly. She went timidly down the steps and saw that the gate intoyoothe garden was open.yooyoo“He must be out there, poor dear,” she thought. She went up to the gateyooand all at once she distinctly heard Grigory calling her by name, “Marfa!yooMarfa!” in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice.yooyoo“Lord, preserve us from harm!” Marfa Ignatyevna murmured, and ran towardsyoothe voice, and that was how she found Grigory. But she found him not byyoothe fence where he had been knocked down, but about twenty paces off. Ityooappeared later, that he had crawled away on coming to himself, andyooprobably had been a long time getting so far, losing consciousness severalyootimes. She noticed at once that he was covered with blood, and screamed atyoothe top of her voice. Grigory was muttering incoherently:yooyoo“He has murdered ... his father murdered.... Why scream, silly ... run ...yoofetch some one....”yooyooBut Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her master’s window wasyooopen and that there was a candle alight in the window, she ran there andyoobegan calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But peeping in at the window, she saw ayoofearful sight. Her master was lying on his back, motionless, on the floor.yooHis light-colored dressing-gown and white shirt were soaked with blood.yooThe candle on the table brightly lighted up the blood and the motionlessyoodead face of Fyodor Pavlovitch. Terror-stricken, Marfa rushed away fromyoothe window, ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of the big gate and ranyooheadlong by the back way to the neighbor, Marya Kondratyevna. Both motheryooand daughter were asleep, but they waked up at Marfa’s desperate andyoopersistent screaming and knocking at the shutter. Marfa, shrieking andyooscreaming incoherently, managed to tell them the main fact, and to beg foryooassistance. It happened that Foma had come back from his wanderings andyoowas staying the night with them. They got him up immediately and all threeyooran to the scene of the crime. On the way, Marya Kondratyevna rememberedyoothat at about eight o’clock she heard a dreadful scream from their garden,yooand this was no doubt Grigory’s scream, “Parricide!” uttered when heyoocaught hold of Mitya’s leg.yooyoo“Some one person screamed out and then was silent,” Marya Kondratyevnayooexplained as she ran. Running to the place where Grigory lay, the twoyoowomen with the help of Foma carried him to the lodge. They lighted ayoocandle and saw that Smerdyakov was no better, that he was writhing inyooconvulsions, his eyes fixed in a squint, and that foam was flowing fromyoohis lips. They moistened Grigory’s forehead with water mixed with vinegar,yooand the water revived him at once. He asked immediately:yooyoo“Is the master murdered?”yooyooThen Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this time that notyooonly the window, but also the door into the garden was wide open, thoughyooFyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week locked himself in every night andyoodid not allow even Grigory to come in on any pretext. Seeing that dooryooopen, they were afraid to go in to Fyodor Pavlovitch “for fear anythingyooshould happen afterwards.” And when they returned to Grigory, the old manyootold them to go straight to the police captain. Marya Kondratyevna ranyoothere and gave the alarm to the whole party at the police captain’s. Sheyooarrived only five minutes before Pyotr Ilyitch, so that his story came,yoonot as his own surmise and theory, but as the direct confirmation, by ayoowitness, of the theory held by all, as to the identity of the criminal (ayootheory he had in the bottom of his heart refused to believe till thatyoomoment).yooyooIt was resolved to act with energy. The deputy police inspector of theyootown was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter Fyodor Pavlovitch’syoohouse and there to open an inquiry on the spot, according to the regularyooforms, which I will not go into here. The district doctor, a zealous man,yoonew to his work, almost insisted on accompanying the police captain, theyooprosecutor, and the investigating lawyer.yooyooI will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite dead,yoowith his skull battered in. But with what? Most likely with the sameyooweapon with which Grigory had been attacked. And immediately that weaponyoowas found, Grigory, to whom all possible medical assistance was at onceyoogiven, described in a weak and breaking voice how he had been knockedyoodown. They began looking with a lantern by the fence and found the brassyoopestle dropped in a most conspicuous place on the garden path. There wereyoono signs of disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying. Butyooby the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a big andyoothick envelope with the inscription: “A present of three thousand roublesyoofor my angel Grushenka, if she is willing to come.” And below had beenyooadded by Fyodor Pavlovitch, “For my little chicken.” There were threeyooseals of red sealing-wax on the envelope, but it had been torn open andyoowas empty: the money had been removed. They found also on the floor ayoopiece of narrow pink ribbon, with which the envelope had been tied up.yooyooOne piece of Pyotr Ilyitch’s evidence made a great impression on theyooprosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea that DmitriyooFyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak, that he had resolved toyoodo so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken the pistols, loaded themyoobefore him, written a letter, put it in his pocket, etc. When PyotryooIlyitch, though still unwilling to believe in it, threatened to tell someyooone so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya had answered grinning: “You’ll beyootoo late.” So they must make haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, beforeyoohe really did shoot himself.yooyoo“That’s clear, that’s clear!” repeated the prosecutor in great excitement.yoo“That’s just the way with mad fellows like that: ‘I shall kill myselfyooto-morrow, so I’ll make merry till I die!’ ”yooyooThe story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited theyooprosecutor more than ever.yooyoo“Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called Olsufyev,yoogentlemen? He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to have his hair curled,yooand then, without even hiding the money, carrying it almost in his hand inyoothe same way, he went off to the girls.”yooyooAll were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and theyooformalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. It all took time andyooso, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe the officer ofyoothe rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov, who had arrived in theyootown the morning before to get his pay. He was instructed to avoid raisingyoothe alarm when he reached Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over theyoo“criminal” till the arrival of the proper authorities, to procure alsoyoowitnesses for the arrest, police constables, and so on. MavrikyyooMavrikyevitch did as he was told, preserving his incognito, and giving noyooone but his old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint ofyoohis secret business. He had spoken to him just before Mitya met theyoolandlord in the balcony, looking for him in the dark, and noticed at onceyooa change in Trifon Borissovitch’s face and voice. So neither Mitya nor anyyooone else knew that he was being watched. The box with the pistols had beenyoocarried off by Trifon Borissovitch and put in a suitable place. Only afteryoofour o’clock, almost at sunrise, all the officials, the police captain,yoothe prosecutor, the investigating lawyer, drove up in two carriages, eachyoodrawn by three horses. The doctor remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s to makeyooa post-mortem next day on the body. But he was particularly interested inyoothe condition of the servant, Smerdyakov.yooyoo“Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually foryootwenty-four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest toyooscience,” he declared enthusiastically to his companions, and as they leftyoothey laughingly congratulated him on his find. The prosecutor and theyooinvestigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor’s saying thatyooSmerdyakov could not outlive the night.yooyooAfter these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will return toyoothat moment of our tale at which we broke off.yooyooyooyooChapter III. The Sufferings Of A Soul, The First OrdealyooyooyooAnd so Mitya sat looking wildly at the people round him, not understandingyoowhat was said to him. Suddenly he got up, flung up his hands, and shoutedyooaloud:yooyoo“I’m not guilty! I’m not guilty of that blood! I’m not guilty of myyoofather’s blood.... I meant to kill him. But I’m not guilty. Not I.”yooyooBut he had hardly said this, before Grushenka rushed from behind theyoocurtain and flung herself at the police captain’s feet.yooyoo“It was my fault! Mine! My wickedness!” she cried, in a heartrendingyoovoice, bathed in tears, stretching out her clasped hands towards them. “Heyoodid it through me. I tortured him and drove him to it. I tortured thatyoopoor old man that’s dead, too, in my wickedness, and brought him to this!yooIt’s my fault, mine first, mine most, my fault!”yooyoo“Yes, it’s your fault! You’re the chief criminal! You fury! You harlot!yooYou’re the most to blame!” shouted the police captain, threatening heryoowith his hand. But he was quickly and resolutely suppressed. Theyooprosecutor positively seized hold of him.yooyoo“This is absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarovitch!” he cried. “You areyoopositively hindering the inquiry.... You’re ruining the case....” heyooalmost gasped.yooyoo“Follow the regular course! Follow the regular course!” cried NikolayyooParfenovitch, fearfully excited too, “otherwise it’s absolutelyyooimpossible!...”yooyoo“Judge us together!” Grushenka cried frantically, still kneeling. “Punishyoous together. I will go with him now, if it’s to death!”yooyoo“Grusha, my life, my blood, my holy one!” Mitya fell on his knees besideyooher and held her tight in his arms. “Don’t believe her,” he cried, “she’syoonot guilty of anything, of any blood, of anything!”yooyooHe remembered afterwards that he was forcibly dragged away from her byyooseveral men, and that she was led out, and that when he recovered himselfyoohe was sitting at the table. Beside him and behind him stood the men withyoometal plates. Facing him on the other side of the table sat NikolayyooParfenovitch, the investigating lawyer. He kept persuading him to drink ayoolittle water out of a glass that stood on the table.yooyoo“That will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, don’t be frightened,”yoohe added, extremely politely. Mitya (he remembered it afterwards) becameyoosuddenly intensely interested in his big rings, one with an amethyst, andyooanother with a transparent bright yellow stone, of great brilliance. Andyoolong afterwards he remembered with wonder how those rings had riveted hisyooattention through all those terrible hours of interrogation, so that heyoowas utterly unable to tear himself away from them and dismiss them, asyoothings that had nothing to do with his position. On Mitya’s left side, inyoothe place where Maximov had been sitting at the beginning of the evening,yoothe prosecutor was now seated, and on Mitya’s right hand, where Grushenkayoohad been, was a rosy-cheeked young man in a sort of shabby hunting-jacket,yoowith ink and paper before him. This was the secretary of the investigatingyoolawyer, who had brought him with him. The police captain was now standingyooby the window at the other end of the room, beside Kalganov, who wasyoositting there.yooyoo“Drink some water,” said the investigating lawyer softly, for the tenthyootime.yooyoo“I have drunk it, gentlemen, I have ... but ... come, gentlemen, crush me,yoopunish me, decide my fate!” cried Mitya, staring with terribly fixedyoowide-open eyes at the investigating lawyer.yooyoo“So you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death of youryoofather, Fyodor Pavlovitch?” asked the investigating lawyer, softly butyooinsistently.yooyoo“I am not guilty. I am guilty of the blood of another old man but not ofyoomy father’s. And I weep for it! I killed, I killed the old man and knockedyoohim down.... But it’s hard to have to answer for that murder with another,yooa terrible murder of which I am not guilty.... It’s a terrible accusation,yoogentlemen, a knock-down blow. But who has killed my father, who has killedyoohim? Who can have killed him if I didn’t? It’s marvelous, extraordinary,yooimpossible.”yooyoo“Yes, who can have killed him?” the investigating lawyer was beginning,yoobut Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at him, addressedyooMitya.yooyoo“You need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory Vassilyevitch.yooHe is alive, he has recovered, and in spite of the terrible blowsyooinflicted, according to his own and your evidence, by you, there seems noyoodoubt that he will live, so the doctor says, at least.”yooyoo“Alive? He’s alive?” cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His face beamed.yoo“Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought for me, a sinner andyooevildoer. That’s an answer to my prayer. I’ve been praying all night.” Andyoohe crossed himself three times. He was almost breathless.yooyoo“So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence concerningyooyou, that—” The prosecutor would have continued, but Mitya suddenly jumpedyooup from his chair.yooyoo“One minute, gentlemen, for God’s sake, one minute; I will run to her—”yooyoo“Excuse me, at this moment it’s quite impossible,” Nikolay Parfenovitchyooalmost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was seized by the menyoowith the metal plates, but he sat down of his own accord....yooyoo“Gentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute only; I wantedyooto tell her that it has been washed away, it has gone, that blood that wasyooweighing on my heart all night, and that I am not a murderer now!yooGentlemen, she is my betrothed!” he said ecstatically and reverently,yoolooking round at them all. “Oh, thank you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minuteyooyou have given me new life, new heart!... That old man used to carry me inyoohis arms, gentlemen. He used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby threeyooyears old, abandoned by every one, he was like a father to me!...”yooyoo“And so you—” the investigating lawyer began.yooyoo“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more,” interposed Mitya, puttingyoohis elbows on the table and covering his face with his hands. “Let me haveyooa moment to think, let me breathe, gentlemen. All this is horriblyyooupsetting, horribly. A man is not a drum, gentlemen!”yooyoo“Drink a little more water,” murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyooMitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were confident.yooHe seemed completely transformed in a moment. His whole bearing wasyoochanged; he was once more the equal of these men, with all of whom he wasyooacquainted, as though they had all met the day before, when nothing hadyoohappened, at some social gathering. We may note in passing that, on hisyoofirst arrival, Mitya had been made very welcome at the police captain’s,yoobut later, during the last month especially, Mitya had hardly called atyooall, and when the police captain met him, in the street, for instance,yooMitya noticed that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness. Hisyooacquaintance with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he sometimesyoopaid his wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, withoutyooquite knowing why, and she always received him graciously and had, foryoosome reason, taken an interest in him up to the last. He had not had timeyooto get to know the investigating lawyer, though he had met him and talkedyooto him twice, each time about the fair sex.yooyoo“You’re a most skillful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,” cried Mitya,yoolaughing gayly, “but I can help you now. Oh, gentlemen, I feel like a newyooman, and don’t be offended at my addressing you so simply and directly.yooI’m rather drunk, too, I’ll tell you that frankly. I believe I’ve had theyoohonor and pleasure of meeting you, Nikolay Parfenovitch, at my kinsmanyooMiüsov’s. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don’t pretend to be on equal terms withyooyou. I understand, of course, in what character I am sitting before you.yooOh, of course, there’s a horrible suspicion ... hanging over me ... ifyooGrigory has given evidence.... A horrible suspicion! It’s awful, awful, Iyoounderstand that! But to business, gentlemen, I am ready, and we will makeyooan end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen, gentlemen! Since I knowyooI’m innocent, we can put an end to it in a minute. Can’t we? Can’t we?”yooyooMitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as though heyoopositively took his listeners to be his best friends.yooyoo“So, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the chargeyoobrought against you,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, impressively, and bendingyoodown to the secretary he dictated to him in an undertone what to write.yooyoo“Write it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it; I consent, Iyoogive my full consent, gentlemen, only ... do you see?... Stay, stay, writeyoothis. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of violence on a poor old man Iyooam guilty. And there is something else at the bottom of my heart, of whichyooI am guilty, too—but that you need not write down” (he turned suddenly toyoothe secretary); “that’s my personal life, gentlemen, that doesn’t concernyooyou, the bottom of my heart, that’s to say.... But of the murder of my oldyoofather I’m not guilty. That’s a wild idea. It’s quite a wild idea!... Iyoowill prove you that and you’ll be convinced directly.... You will laugh,yoogentlemen. You’ll laugh yourselves at your suspicion!...”yooyoo“Be calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” said the investigating lawyer evidentlyyootrying to allay Mitya’s excitement by his own composure. “Before we go onyoowith our inquiry, I should like, if you will consent to answer, to hearyooyou confirm the statement that you disliked your father, FyodoryooPavlovitch, that you were involved in continual disputes with him. Here atyooleast, a quarter of an hour ago, you exclaimed that you wanted to killyoohim: ‘I didn’t kill him,’ you said, ‘but I wanted to kill him.’ ”yooyoo“Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes, unhappily, I didyoowant to kill him ... many times I wanted to ... unhappily, unhappily!”yooyoo“You wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives precisely ledyooyou to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent?”yooyoo“What is there to explain, gentlemen?” Mitya shrugged his shouldersyoosullenly, looking down. “I have never concealed my feelings. All the townyooknows about it—every one knows in the tavern. Only lately I declared themyooin Father Zossima’s cell.... And the very same day, in the evening I beatyoomy father. I nearly killed him, and I swore I’d come again and kill him,yoobefore witnesses.... Oh, a thousand witnesses! I’ve been shouting it aloudyoofor the last month, any one can tell you that!... The fact stares you inyoothe face, it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen,yoofeelings are another matter. You see, gentlemen”—Mitya frowned—“it seemsyooto me that about feelings you’ve no right to question me. I know that youyooare bound by your office, I quite understand that, but that’s my affair,yoomy private, intimate affair, yet ... since I haven’t concealed my feelingsyooin the past ... in the tavern, for instance, I’ve talked to every one, soyoo... so I won’t make a secret of it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen,yoothat there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told everyyooone that I’d kill him, and now, all of a sudden, he’s been killed. So ityoomust have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen, I canyooquite make allowances. I’m struck all of a heap myself, for who can haveyoomurdered him, if not I? That’s what it comes to, isn’t it? If not I, whoyoocan it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know, I insist on knowing!” heyooexclaimed suddenly. “Where was he murdered? How was he murdered? How, andyoowith what? Tell me,” he asked quickly, looking at the two lawyers.yooyoo“We found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with his headyoobattered in,” said the prosecutor.yooyoo“That’s horrible!” Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on the table,yoohid his face in his right hand.yooyoo“We will continue,” interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. “So what was it thatyooimpelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have asserted in public, Iyoobelieve, that it was based upon jealousy?”yooyoo“Well, yes, jealousy. And not only jealousy.”yooyoo“Disputes about money?”yooyoo“Yes, about money, too.”yooyoo“There was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think, which youyooclaimed as part of your inheritance?”yooyoo“Three thousand! More, more,” cried Mitya hotly; “more than six thousand,yoomore than ten, perhaps. I told every one so, shouted it at them. But Iyoomade up my mind to let it go at three thousand. I was desperately in needyooof that three thousand ... so the bundle of notes for three thousand thatyooI knew he kept under his pillow, ready for Grushenka, I considered asyoosimply stolen from me. Yes, gentlemen, I looked upon it as mine, as my ownyooproperty....”yooyooThe prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer, and hadyootime to wink at him on the sly.yooyoo“We will return to that subject later,” said the lawyer promptly. “Youyoowill allow us to note that point and write it down; that you looked uponyoothat money as your own property?”yooyoo“Write it down, by all means. I know that’s another fact that tellsyooagainst me, but I’m not afraid of facts and I tell them against myself. Doyooyou hear? Do you know, gentlemen, you take me for a different sort of manyoofrom what I am,” he added, suddenly gloomy and dejected. “You have to dealyoowith a man of honor, a man of the highest honor; above all—don’t loseyoosight of it—a man who’s done a lot of nasty things, but has always been,yooand still is, honorable at bottom, in his inner being. I don’t know how toyooexpress it. That’s just what’s made me wretched all my life, that Iyooyearned to be honorable, that I was, so to say, a martyr to a sense ofyoohonor, seeking for it with a lantern, with the lantern of Diogenes, andyooyet all my life I’ve been doing filthy things like all of us, gentlemenyoo... that is like me alone. That was a mistake, like me alone, me alone!...yooGentlemen, my head aches ...” His brows contracted with pain. “You see,yoogentlemen, I couldn’t bear the look of him, there was something in himyooignoble, impudent, trampling on everything sacred, something sneering andyooirreverent, loathsome, loathsome. But now that he’s dead, I feelyoodifferently.”yooyoo“How do you mean?”yooyoo“I don’t feel differently, but I wish I hadn’t hated him so.”yooyoo“You feel penitent?”yooyoo“No, not penitent, don’t write that. I’m not much good myself, I’m notyoovery beautiful, so I had no right to consider him repulsive. That’s what Iyoomean. Write that down, if you like.”yooyooSaying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more and more gloomyyooas the inquiry continued.yooyooAt that moment another unexpected scene followed. Though Grushenka hadyoobeen removed, she had not been taken far away, only into the room next butyooone from the blue room, in which the examination was proceeding. It was ayoolittle room with one window, next beyond the large room in which they hadyoodanced and feasted so lavishly. She was sitting there with no one by heryoobut Maximov, who was terribly depressed, terribly scared, and clung to heryooside, as though for security. At their door stood one of the peasants withyooa metal plate on his breast. Grushenka was crying, and suddenly her griefyoowas too much for her, she jumped up, flung up her arms and, with a loudyoowail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to him, to her Mitya, and soyoounexpectedly that they had not time to stop her. Mitya, hearing her cry,yootrembled, jumped up, and with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her, notyooknowing what he was doing. But they were not allowed to come together,yoothough they saw one another. He was seized by the arms. He struggled, andyootried to tear himself away. It took three or four men to hold him. She wasyooseized too, and he saw her stretching out her arms to him, crying aloud asyoothey carried her away. When the scene was over, he came to himself again,yoositting in the same place as before, opposite the investigating lawyer,yooand crying out to them:yooyoo“What do you want with her? Why do you torment her? She’s done nothing,yoonothing!...”yooyooThe lawyers tried to soothe him. About ten minutes passed like this. Atyoolast Mihail Makarovitch, who had been absent, came hurriedly into theyooroom, and said in a loud and excited voice to the prosecutor:yooyoo“She’s been removed, she’s downstairs. Will you allow me to say one wordyooto this unhappy man, gentlemen? In your presence, gentlemen, in youryoopresence.”yooyoo“By all means, Mihail Makarovitch,” answered the investigating lawyer. “Inyoothe present case we have nothing against it.”yooyoo“Listen, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear fellow,” began the police captain,yooand there was a look of warm, almost fatherly, feeling for the lucklessyooprisoner on his excited face. “I took your Agrafena Alexandrovnayoodownstairs myself, and confided her to the care of the landlord’syoodaughters, and that old fellow Maximov is with her all the time. And Iyoosoothed her, do you hear? I soothed and calmed her. I impressed on heryoothat you have to clear yourself, so she mustn’t hinder you, must notyoodepress you, or you may lose your head and say the wrong thing in youryooevidence. In fact, I talked to her and she understood. She’s a sensibleyoogirl, my boy, a good-hearted girl, she would have kissed my old hands,yoobegging help for you. She sent me herself, to tell you not to worry aboutyooher. And I must go, my dear fellow, I must go and tell her that you areyoocalm and comforted about her. And so you must be calm, do you understand?yooI was unfair to her; she is a Christian soul, gentlemen, yes, I tell you,yooshe’s a gentle soul, and not to blame for anything. So what am I to tellyooher, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Will you sit quiet or not?”yooyooThe good-natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular, butyooGrushenka’s suffering, a fellow creature’s suffering, touched hisyoogood-natured heart, and tears stood in his eyes. Mitya jumped up andyoorushed towards him.yooyoo“Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me!” he cried. “You’ve theyooheart of an angel, an angel, Mihail Makarovitch, I thank you for her. Iyoowill, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact. Tell her, in the kindness of youryooheart, that I am cheerful, quite cheerful, that I shall be laughing in ayoominute, knowing that she has a guardian angel like you. I shall have doneyoowith all this directly, and as soon as I’m free, I’ll be with her, she’llyoosee, let her wait. Gentlemen,” he said, turning to the two lawyers, “nowyooI’ll open my whole soul to you; I’ll pour out everything. We’ll finishyoothis off directly, finish it off gayly. We shall laugh at it in the end,yooshan’t we? But, gentlemen, that woman is the queen of my heart. Oh, let meyootell you that. That one thing I’ll tell you now.... I see I’m withyoohonorable men. She is my light, she is my holy one, and if only you knew!yooDid you hear her cry, ‘I’ll go to death with you’? And what have I, ayoopenniless beggar, done for her? Why such love for me? How can a clumsy,yoougly brute like me, with my ugly face, deserve such love, that she isyooready to go to exile with me? And how she fell down at your feet for myyoosake, just now!... and yet she’s proud and has done nothing! How can Iyoohelp adoring her, how can I help crying out and rushing to her as I didyoojust now? Gentlemen, forgive me! But now, now I am comforted.”yooyooAnd he sank back in his chair and, covering his face with his hands, burstyoointo tears. But they were happy tears. He recovered himself instantly. Theyooold police captain seemed much pleased, and the lawyers also. They feltyoothat the examination was passing into a new phase. When the police captainyoowent out, Mitya was positively gay.yooyoo“Now, gentlemen, I am at your disposal, entirely at your disposal. And ifyooit were not for all these trivial details, we should understand oneyooanother in a minute. I’m at those details again. I’m at your disposal,yoogentlemen, but I declare that we must have mutual confidence, you in meyooand I in you, or there’ll be no end to it. I speak in your interests. Toyoobusiness, gentlemen, to business, and don’t rummage in my soul; don’tyootease me with trifles, but only ask me about facts and what matters, and Iyoowill satisfy you at once. And damn the details!”yooyooSo spoke Mitya. The interrogation began again.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. The Second Ordealyooyooyoo“You don’t know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, by youryooreadiness to answer,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, with an animated air, andyooobvious satisfaction beaming in his very prominent, short-sighted, lightyoogray eyes, from which he had removed his spectacles a moment before. “Andyooyou have made a very just remark about the mutual confidence, withoutyoowhich it is sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of suchyooimportance, if the suspected party really hopes and desires to defendyoohimself and is in a position to do so. We, on our side, will do everythingyooin our power, and you can see for yourself how we are conducting the case.yooYou approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?” He turned to the prosecutor.yooyoo“Oh, undoubtedly,” replied the prosecutor. His tone was somewhat cold,yoocompared with Nikolay Parfenovitch’s impulsiveness.yooyooI will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but latelyyooarrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect for IppolityooKirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his bosom friend. Heyoowas almost the only person who put implicit faith in IppolityooKirillovitch’s extraordinary talents as a psychologist and orator and inyoothe justice of his grievance. He had heard of him in Petersburg. On theyooother hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch was the only person in the wholeyooworld whom our “unappreciated” prosecutor genuinely liked. On their way toyooMokroe they had time to come to an understanding about the present case.yooAnd now as they sat at the table, the sharp-witted junior caught andyoointerpreted every indication on his senior colleague’s face—half a word, ayooglance, or a wink.yooyoo“Gentlemen, only let me tell my own story and don’t interrupt me withyootrivial questions and I’ll tell you everything in a moment,” said Mityayooexcitedly.yooyoo“Excellent! Thank you. But before we proceed to listen to youryoocommunication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact ofyoogreat interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday atyooabout five o’clock on the security of your pistols, from your friend,yooPyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.”yooyoo“I pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles. What more?yooThat’s all about it. As soon as I got back to town I pledged them.”yooyoo“You got back to town? Then you had been out of town?”yooyoo“Yes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country. Didn’t you know?”yooyooThe prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.yooyoo“Well, how would it be if you began your story with a systematicyoodescription of all you did yesterday, from the morning onwards? Allow us,yoofor instance, to inquire why you were absent from the town, and just whenyooyou left and when you came back—all those facts.”yooyoo“You should have asked me like that from the beginning,” cried Mitya,yoolaughing aloud, “and, if you like, we won’t begin from yesterday, but fromyoothe morning of the day before; then you’ll understand how, why, and whereyooI went. I went the day before yesterday, gentlemen, to a merchant of theyootown, called Samsonov, to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safeyoosecurity. It was a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity.”yooyoo“Allow me to interrupt you,” the prosecutor put in politely. “Why were youyooin such pressing need for just that sum, three thousand?”yooyoo“Oh, gentlemen, you needn’t go into details, how, when and why, and whyyoojust so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole. Why, it’llyoorun to three volumes, and then you’ll want an epilogue!”yooyooMitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient familiarity of ayooman who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full of the bestyoointentions.yooyoo“Gentlemen!”—he corrected himself hurriedly—“don’t be vexed with me for myyoorestiveness, I beg you again. Believe me once more, I feel the greatestyoorespect for you and understand the true position of affairs. Don’t thinkyooI’m drunk. I’m quite sober now. And, besides, being drunk would be noyoohindrance. It’s with me, you know, like the saying: ‘When he is sober, heyoois a fool; when he is drunk, he is a wise man.’ Ha ha! But I see,yoogentlemen, it’s not the proper thing to make jokes to you, till we’ve hadyooour explanation, I mean. And I’ve my own dignity to keep up, too. I quiteyoounderstand the difference for the moment. I am, after all, in the positionyooof a criminal, and so, far from being on equal terms with you. And it’syooyour business to watch me. I can’t expect you to pat me on the head foryoowhat I did to Grigory, for one can’t break old men’s heads with impunity.yooI suppose you’ll put me away for him for six months, or a year perhaps, inyooa house of correction. I don’t know what the punishment is—but it will beyoowithout loss of the rights of my rank, without loss of my rank, won’t it?yooSo you see, gentlemen, I understand the distinction between us.... But youyoomust see that you could puzzle God Himself with such questions. ‘How didyooyou step? Where did you step? When did you step? And on what did youyoostep?’ I shall get mixed up, if you go on like this, and you will put ityooall down against me. And what will that lead to? To nothing! And even ifyooit’s nonsense I’m talking now, let me finish, and you, gentlemen, beingyoomen of honor and refinement, will forgive me! I’ll finish by asking you,yoogentlemen, to drop that conventional method of questioning. I mean,yoobeginning from some miserable trifle, how I got up, what I had foryoobreakfast, how I spat, and where I spat, and so distracting the attentionyooof the criminal, suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question, ‘Whomyoodid you murder? Whom did you rob?’ Ha ha! That’s your regulation method,yoothat’s where all your cunning comes in. You can put peasants off theiryooguard like that, but not me. I know the tricks. I’ve been in the service,yootoo. Ha ha ha! You’re not angry, gentlemen? You forgive my impertinence?”yoohe cried, looking at them with a good-nature that was almost surprising.yoo“It’s only Mitya Karamazov, you know, so you can overlook it. It would beyooinexcusable in a sensible man; but you can forgive it in Mitya. Ha ha!”yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. Though the prosecutor didyoonot laugh, he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya, as though anxious notyooto miss the least syllable, the slightest movement, the smallest twitch ofyooany feature of his face.yooyoo“That’s how we have treated you from the beginning,” said NikolayyooParfenovitch, still laughing. “We haven’t tried to put you out by askingyoohow you got up in the morning and what you had for breakfast. We began,yooindeed, with questions of the greatest importance.”yooyoo“I understand. I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate still moreyooyour present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness, worthy of youryoonoble hearts. We three here are gentlemen, and let everything be on theyoofooting of mutual confidence between educated, well-bred people, who haveyoothe common bond of noble birth and honor. In any case, allow me to lookyooupon you as my best friends at this moment of my life, at this moment whenyoomy honor is assailed. That’s no offense to you, gentlemen, is it?”yooyoo“On the contrary. You’ve expressed all that so well, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,”yooNikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified approbation.yooyoo“And enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those trickyyooquestions!” cried Mitya enthusiastically. “Or there’s simply no knowingyoowhere we shall get to! Is there?”yooyoo“I will follow your sensible advice entirely,” the prosecutor interposed,yooaddressing Mitya. “I don’t withdraw my question, however. It is nowyoovitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that sum, I meanyooprecisely three thousand.”yooyoo“Why I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another.... Well, it was to payyooa debt.”yooyoo“A debt to whom?”yooyoo“That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I couldn’t, oryoobecause I shouldn’t dare, or because it would be damaging, for it’s all ayoopaltry matter and absolutely trifling, but—I won’t, because it’s a matteryooof principle: that’s my private life, and I won’t allow any intrusion intoyoomy private life. That’s my principle. Your question has no bearing on theyoocase, and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair. Iyoowanted to pay a debt. I wanted to pay a debt of honor but to whom I won’tyoosay.”yooyoo“Allow me to make a note of that,” said the prosecutor.yooyoo“By all means. Write down that I won’t say, that I won’t. Write that Iyooshould think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can write it; you’ve nothingyooelse to do with your time.”yooyoo“Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if you areyoounaware of it,” the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and sternyooimpressiveness, “that you have a perfect right not to answer the questionsyooput to you now, and we on our side have no right to extort an answer fromyooyou, if you decline to give it for one reason or another. That is entirelyyooa matter for your personal decision. But it is our duty, on the otheryoohand, in such cases as the present, to explain and set before you theyoodegree of injury you will be doing yourself by refusing to give this oryoothat piece of evidence. After which I will beg you to continue.”yooyoo“Gentlemen, I’m not angry ... I ...” Mitya muttered in a ratheryoodisconcerted tone. “Well, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov to whom I wentyoothen ...”yooyooWe will, of course, not reproduce his account of what is known to theyooreader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightestyoodetail. At the same time he was in a hurry to get it over. But as he gaveyoohis evidence it was written down, and therefore they had continually toyoopull him up. Mitya disliked this, but submitted; got angry, though stillyoogood-humoredly. He did, it is true, exclaim, from time to time,yoo“Gentlemen, that’s enough to make an angel out of patience!” Or,yoo“Gentlemen, it’s no good your irritating me.”yooyooBut even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his geniallyyooexpansive mood. So he told them how Samsonov had made a fool of him twoyoodays before. (He had completely realized by now that he had been fooled.)yooThe sale of his watch for six roubles to obtain money for the journey wasyoosomething new to the lawyers. They were at once greatly interested, andyooeven, to Mitya’s intense indignation, thought it necessary to write theyoofact down as a secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he hadyoohardly a farthing in his pocket at the time. Little by little Mitya beganyooto grow surly. Then, after describing his journey to see Lyagavy, theyoonight spent in the stifling hut, and so on, he came to his return to theyootown. Here he began, without being particularly urged, to give a minuteyooaccount of the agonies of jealousy he endured on Grushenka’s account.yooyooHe was heard with silent attention. They inquired particularly into theyoocircumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya Kondratyevna’s houseyooat the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s garden to keep watch on Grushenka, andyooof Smerdyakov’s bringing him information. They laid particular stress onyoothis, and noted it down. Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length,yooand though inwardly ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings toyoo“public ignominy,” so to speak, he evidently overcame his shame in orderyooto tell the truth. The frigid severity, with which the investigatingyoolawyer, and still more the prosecutor, stared intently at him as he toldyoohis story, disconcerted him at last considerably.yooyoo“That boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense aboutyoowomen only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are not worth myyootelling this to,” he reflected mournfully. “It’s ignominious. ‘Be patient,yoohumble, hold thy peace.’ ” He wound up his reflections with that line. Butyoohe pulled himself together to go on again. When he came to telling of hisyoovisit to Madame Hohlakov, he regained his spirits and even wished to tellyooa little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case. Butyoothe investigating lawyer stopped him, and civilly suggested that he shouldyoopass on to “more essential matters.” At last, when he described hisyoodespair and told them how, when he left Madame Hohlakov’s, he thought thatyoohe’d “get three thousand if he had to murder some one to do it,” theyyoostopped him again and noted down that he had “meant to murder some one.”yooMitya let them write it without protest. At last he reached the point inyoohis story when he learned that Grushenka had deceived him and had returnedyoofrom Samsonov’s as soon as he left her there, though she had said that sheyoowould stay there till midnight.yooyoo“If I didn’t kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I hadn’tyootime,” broke from him suddenly at that point in his story. That, too, wasyoocarefully written down. Mitya waited gloomily, and was beginning to tellyoohow he ran into his father’s garden when the investigating lawyer suddenlyyoostopped him, and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside himyoohe brought out the brass pestle.yooyoo“Do you recognize this object?” he asked, showing it to Mitya.yooyoo“Oh, yes,” he laughed gloomily. “Of course I recognize it. Let me have ayoolook at it.... Damn it, never mind!”yooyoo“You have forgotten to mention it,” observed the investigating lawyer.yooyoo“Hang it all, I shouldn’t have concealed it from you. Do you suppose Iyoocould have managed without it? It simply escaped my memory.”yooyoo“Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it.”yooyoo“Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen.”yooyooAnd Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran.yooyoo“But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon?”yooyoo“What object? No object. I just picked it up and ran off.”yooyoo“What for, if you had no object?”yooyooMitya’s wrath flared up. He looked intently at “the boy” and smiledyoogloomily and malignantly. He was feeling more and more ashamed at havingyootold “such people” the story of his jealousy so sincerely andyoospontaneously.yooyoo“Bother the pestle!” broke from him suddenly.yooyoo“But still—”yooyoo“Oh, to keep off dogs.... Oh, because it was dark.... In case anythingyooturned up.”yooyoo“But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when youyoowent out, since you’re afraid of the dark?”yooyoo“Ugh! damn it all, gentlemen! There’s positively no talking to you!” criedyooMitya, exasperated beyond endurance, and turning to the secretary, crimsonyoowith anger, he said quickly, with a note of fury in his voice:yooyoo“Write down at once ... at once ... ‘that I snatched up the pestle to goyooand kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the headyoowith it!’ Well, now are you satisfied, gentlemen? Are your mindsyoorelieved?” he said, glaring defiantly at the lawyers.yooyoo“We quite understand that you made that statement just now throughyooexasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which you consideryootrivial, though they are, in fact, essential,” the prosecutor remarkedyoodryly in reply.yooyoo“Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle.... What does oneyoopick things up for at such moments? I don’t know what for. I snatched ityooup and ran—that’s all. For to me, gentlemen, _passons_, or I declare Iyoowon’t tell you any more.”yooyooHe sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand. He satyoosideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a feeling ofyoonausea. He had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up and declare thatyoohe wouldn’t say another word, “not if you hang me for it.”yooyoo“You see, gentlemen,” he said at last, with difficulty controllingyoohimself, “you see. I listen to you and am haunted by a dream.... It’s ayoodream I have sometimes, you know.... I often dream it—it’s always the sameyoo... that some one is hunting me, some one I’m awfully afraid of ... thatyoohe’s hunting me in the dark, in the night ... tracking me, and I hideyoosomewhere from him, behind a door or cupboard, hide in a degrading way,yooand the worst of it is, he always knows where I am, but he pretends not toyooknow where I am on purpose, to prolong my agony, to enjoy my terror....yooThat’s just what you’re doing now. It’s just like that!”yooyoo“Is that the sort of thing you dream about?” inquired the prosecutor.yooyoo“Yes, it is. Don’t you want to write it down?” said Mitya, with ayoodistorted smile.yooyoo“No; no need to write it down. But still you do have curious dreams.”yooyoo“It’s not a question of dreams now, gentlemen—this is realism, this isyooreal life! I’m a wolf and you’re the hunters. Well, hunt him down!”yooyoo“You are wrong to make such comparisons ...” began Nikolay Parfenovitch,yoowith extraordinary softness.yooyoo“No, I’m not wrong, not at all!” Mitya flared up again, though hisyoooutburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart. He grew moreyoogood-humored at every word. “You may not trust a criminal or a man onyootrial tortured by your questions, but an honorable man, the honorableyooimpulses of the heart (I say that boldly!)—no! That you must believe youyoohave no right indeed ... but—yooyooyoo    Be silent, heart,yoo    Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.yooyooyooWell, shall I go on?” he broke off gloomily.yooyoo“If you’ll be so kind,” answered Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyooyooyooChapter V. The Third OrdealyooyooyooThough Mitya spoke sullenly, it was evident that he was trying more thanyooever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story. He told them howyoohe had leapt over the fence into his father’s garden; how he had gone upyooto the window; told them all that had passed under the window. Clearly,yooprecisely, distinctly, he described the feelings that troubled him duringyoothose moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whetheryooGrushenka was with his father or not. But, strange to say, both theyoolawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve, looked coldly at him,yooasked few questions. Mitya could gather nothing from their faces.yooyoo“They’re angry and offended,” he thought. “Well, bother them!”yooyooWhen he described how he made up his mind at last to make the “signal” toyoohis father that Grushenka had come, so that he should open the window, theyoolawyers paid no attention to the word “signal,” as though they entirelyyoofailed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection: so much so,yoothat Mitya noticed it. Coming at last to the moment when, seeing hisyoofather peering out of the window, his hatred flared up and he pulled theyoopestle out of his pocket, he suddenly, as though of design, stopped short.yooHe sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed uponyoohim.yooyoo“Well?” said the investigating lawyer. “You pulled out the weapon and ...yooand what happened then?”yooyoo“Then? Why, then I murdered him ... hit him on the head and cracked hisyooskull.... I suppose that’s your story. That’s it!”yooyooHis eyes suddenly flashed. All his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up withyooextraordinary violence in his soul.yooyoo“Our story?” repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch. “Well—and yours?”yooyooMitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent.yooyoo“My story, gentlemen? Well, it was like this,” he began softly. “Whetheryooit was some one’s tears, or my mother prayed to God, or a good angelyookissed me at that instant, I don’t know. But the devil was conquered. Iyoorushed from the window and ran to the fence. My father was alarmed and,yoofor the first time, he saw me then, cried out, and sprang back from theyoowindow. I remember that very well. I ran across the garden to the fenceyoo... and there Grigory caught me, when I was sitting on the fence.”yooyooAt that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners. Theyyooseemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention. A sort ofyooparoxysm of indignation seized on Mitya’s soul.yooyoo“Why, you’re laughing at me at this moment, gentlemen!” he broke offyoosuddenly.yooyoo“What makes you think that?” observed Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyoo“You don’t believe one word—that’s why! I understand, of course, that Iyoohave come to the vital point. The old man’s lying there now with his skullyoobroken, while I—after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him,yooand how I snatched up the pestle—I suddenly run away from the window. Ayooromance! Poetry! As though one could believe a fellow on his word. Ha ha!yooYou are scoffers, gentlemen!”yooyooAnd he swung round on his chair so that it creaked.yooyoo“And did you notice,” asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though notyooobserving Mitya’s excitement, “did you notice when you ran away from theyoowindow, whether the door into the garden was open?”yooyoo“No, it was not open.”yooyoo“It was not?”yooyoo“It was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door. Wait a bit!” he seemedyoosuddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start:yooyoo“Why, did you find the door open?”yooyoo“Yes, it was open.”yooyoo“Why, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves?” criedyooMitya, greatly astonished.yooyoo“The door stood open, and your father’s murderer undoubtedly went in atyoothat door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out again by the sameyoodoor,” the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as though chiseling outyooeach word separately. “That is perfectly clear. The murder was committedyooin the room and _not through the __ window_; that is absolutely certainyoofrom the examination that has been made, from the position of the body andyooeverything. There can be no doubt of that circumstance.”yooyooMitya was absolutely dumbfounded.yooyoo“But that’s utterly impossible!” he cried, completely at a loss. “I ... Iyoodidn’t go in.... I tell you positively, definitely, the door was shut theyoowhole time I was in the garden, and when I ran out of the garden. I onlyyoostood at the window and saw him through the window. That’s all, that’syooall.... I remember to the last minute. And if I didn’t remember, it wouldyoobe just the same. I know it, for no one knew the signals exceptyooSmerdyakov, and me, and the dead man. And he wouldn’t have opened the dooryooto any one in the world without the signals.”yooyoo“Signals? What signals?” asked the prosecutor, with greedy, almostyoohysterical, curiosity. He instantly lost all trace of his reserve andyoodignity. He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity. Heyooscented an important fact of which he had known nothing, and was alreadyyoofilled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it.yooyoo“So you didn’t know!” Mitya winked at him with a malicious and mockingyoosmile. “What if I won’t tell you? From whom could you find out? No oneyooknew about the signals except my father, Smerdyakov, and me: that was all.yooHeaven knew, too, but it won’t tell you. But it’s an interesting fact.yooThere’s no knowing what you might build on it. Ha ha! Take comfort,yoogentlemen, I’ll reveal it. You’ve some foolish idea in your hearts. Youyoodon’t know the man you have to deal with! You have to do with a prisoneryoowho gives evidence against himself, to his own damage! Yes, for I’m a manyooof honor and you—are not.”yooyooThe prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur. He was trembling withyooimpatience to hear the new fact. Minutely and diffusely Mitya told themyooeverything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov.yooHe told them exactly what every tap on the window meant, tapped theyoosignals on the table, and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposedyoohe, Mitya, had tapped the signal “Grushenka has come,” when he tapped toyoohis father, he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal, thatyoo“Grushenka had come.”yooyoo“So now you can build up your tower,” Mitya broke off, and again turnedyooaway from them contemptuously.yooyoo“So no one knew of the signals but your dead father, you, and the valetyooSmerdyakov? And no one else?” Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more.yooyoo“Yes. The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven. Write down about Heaven. That mayyoobe of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves.”yooyooAnd they had already, of course, begun writing it down. But while theyyoowrote, the prosecutor said suddenly, as though pitching on a new idea:yooyoo“But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny allyooresponsibility for the death of your father, was it not he, perhaps, whoyooknocked the signal agreed upon, induced your father to open to him, andyoothen ... committed the crime?”yooyooMitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred. Hisyoosilent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink.yooyoo“You’ve caught the fox again,” commented Mitya at last; “you’ve got theyoobeast by the tail. Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You thought,yooof course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shoutyoowith all my might, ‘Aie! it’s Smerdyakov; he’s the murderer.’ Confessyoothat’s what you thought. Confess, and I’ll go on.”yooyooBut the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited.yooyoo“You’re mistaken. I’m not going to shout ‘It’s Smerdyakov,’ ” said Mitya.yooyoo“And you don’t even suspect him?”yooyoo“Why, do you suspect him?”yooyoo“He is suspected, too.”yooyooMitya fixed his eyes on the floor.yooyoo“Joking apart,” he brought out gloomily. “Listen. From the very beginning,yooalmost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I’veyoohad the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I’ve been sitting here, shoutingyoothat I’m innocent and thinking all the time ‘Smerdyakov!’ I can’t getyooSmerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov justyoonow; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, ‘No, it’s notyooSmerdyakov.’ It’s not his doing, gentlemen.”yooyoo“In that case is there anybody else you suspect?” Nikolay Parfenovitchyooinquired cautiously.yooyoo“I don’t know any one it could be, whether it’s the hand of Heaven oryooSatan, but ... not Smerdyakov,” Mitya jerked out with decision.yooyoo“But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it’s notyoohe?”yooyoo“From my conviction—my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the mostyooabject character and a coward. He’s not a coward, he’s the epitome of allyoothe cowardice in the world walking on two legs. He has the heart of ayoochicken. When he talked to me, he was always trembling for fear I shouldyookill him, though I never raised my hand against him. He fell at my feetyooand blubbered; he has kissed these very boots, literally, beseeching meyoo‘not to frighten him.’ Do you hear? ‘Not to frighten him.’ What a thing toyoosay! Why, I offered him money. He’s a puling chicken—sickly, epileptic,yooweak-minded—a child of eight could thrash him. He has no character worthyootalking about. It’s not Smerdyakov, gentlemen. He doesn’t care for money;yoohe wouldn’t take my presents. Besides, what motive had he for murderingyoothe old man? Why, he’s very likely his son, you know—his natural son. Doyooyou know that?”yooyoo“We have heard that legend. But you are your father’s son, too, you know;yooyet you yourself told every one you meant to murder him.”yooyoo“That’s a thrust! And a nasty, mean one, too! I’m not afraid! Oh,yoogentlemen, isn’t it too base of you to say that to my face? It’s base,yoobecause I told you that myself. I not only wanted to murder him, but Iyoomight have done it. And, what’s more, I went out of my way to tell you ofyoomy own accord that I nearly murdered him. But, you see, I didn’t murderyoohim; you see, my guardian angel saved me—that’s what you’ve not taken intoyooaccount. And that’s why it’s so base of you. For I didn’t kill him, Iyoodidn’t kill him! Do you hear, I did not kill him.”yooyooHe was almost choking. He had not been so moved before during the wholeyoointerrogation.yooyoo“And what has he told you, gentlemen—Smerdyakov, I mean?” he addedyoosuddenly, after a pause. “May I ask that question?”yooyoo“You may ask any question,” the prosecutor replied with frigid severity,yoo“any question relating to the facts of the case, and we are, I repeat,yoobound to answer every inquiry you make. We found the servant Smerdyakov,yooconcerning whom you inquire, lying unconscious in his bed, in an epilepticyoofit of extreme severity, that had recurred, possibly, ten times. Theyoodoctor who was with us told us, after seeing him, that he may possibly notyoooutlive the night.”yooyoo“Well, if that’s so, the devil must have killed him,” broke suddenly fromyooMitya, as though until that moment he had been asking himself: “Was ityooSmerdyakov or not?”yooyoo“We will come back to this later,” Nikolay Parfenovitch decided. “Now,yoowouldn’t you like to continue your statement?”yooyooMitya asked for a rest. His request was courteously granted. Afteryooresting, he went on with his story. But he was evidently depressed. He wasyooexhausted, mortified and morally shaken. To make things worse theyooprosecutor exasperated him, as though intentionally, by vexatiousyoointerruptions about “trifling points.” Scarcely had Mitya described how,yoositting on the wall, he had struck Grigory on the head with the pestle,yoowhile the old man had hold of his left leg, and how he had then jumpedyoodown to look at him, when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him toyoodescribe exactly how he was sitting on the wall. Mitya was surprised.yooyoo“Oh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of the wall andyooone on the other.”yooyoo“And the pestle?”yooyoo“The pestle was in my hand.”yooyoo“Not in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely? Was it a violent blowyooyou gave him?”yooyoo“It must have been a violent one. But why do you ask?”yooyoo“Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then andyooshowing us just how you moved your arm, and in what direction?”yooyoo“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” asked Mitya, looking haughtily atyoothe speaker; but the latter did not flinch.yooyooMitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his arm.yooyoo“This was how I struck him! That’s how I knocked him down! What more doyooyou want?”yooyoo“Thank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down, withyoowhat object, and what you had in view?”yooyoo“Oh, hang it!... I jumped down to look at the man I’d hurt ... I don’tyooknow what for!”yooyoo“Though you were so excited and were running away?”yooyoo“Yes, though I was excited and running away.”yooyoo“You wanted to help him?”yooyoo“Help!... Yes, perhaps I did want to help him.... I don’t remember.”yooyoo“You don’t remember? Then you didn’t quite know what you were doing?”yooyoo“Not at all. I remember everything—every detail. I jumped down to look atyoohim, and wiped his face with my handkerchief.”yooyoo“We have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him toyooconsciousness?”yooyoo“I don’t know whether I hoped it. I simply wanted to make sure whether heyoowas alive or not.”yooyoo“Ah! You wanted to be sure? Well, what then?”yooyoo“I’m not a doctor. I couldn’t decide. I ran away thinking I’d killed him.yooAnd now he’s recovered.”yooyoo“Excellent,” commented the prosecutor. “Thank you. That’s all I wanted.yooKindly proceed.”yooyooAlas! it never entered Mitya’s head to tell them, though he remembered it,yoothat he had jumped back from pity, and standing over the prostrate figureyoohad even uttered some words of regret: “You’ve come to grief, oldyooman—there’s no help for it. Well, there you must lie.”yooyooThe prosecutor could only draw one conclusion: that the man had jumpedyooback “at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object ofyooascertaining whether the _only_ witness of his crime were dead; that heyoomust therefore have been a man of great strength, coolness, decision andyooforesight even at such a moment,” ... and so on. The prosecutor wasyoosatisfied: “I’ve provoked the nervous fellow by ‘trifles’ and he has saidyoomore than he meant to.”yooyooWith painful effort Mitya went on. But this time he was pulled upyooimmediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyoo“How came you to run to the servant, Fedosya Markovna, with your hands soyoocovered with blood, and, as it appears, your face, too?”yooyoo“Why, I didn’t notice the blood at all at the time,” answered Mitya.yooyoo“That’s quite likely. It does happen sometimes.” The prosecutor exchangedyooglances with Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyoo“I simply didn’t notice. You’re quite right there, prosecutor,” Mityayooassented suddenly.yooyooNext came the account of Mitya’s sudden determination to “step aside” andyoomake way for their happiness. But he could not make up his mind to openyoohis heart to them as before, and tell them about “the queen of his soul.”yooHe disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons “who wereyoofastening on him like bugs.” And so in response to their reiteratedyooquestions he answered briefly and abruptly:yooyoo“Well, I made up my mind to kill myself. What had I left to live for? Thatyooquestion stared me in the face. Her first rightful lover had come back,yoothe man who wronged her but who’d hurried back to offer his love, afteryoofive years, and atone for the wrong with marriage.... So I knew it was allyooover for me.... And behind me disgrace, and that blood—Grigory’s.... Whatyoohad I to live for? So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged, to loadyoothem and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow.”yooyoo“And a grand feast the night before?”yooyoo“Yes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen! Do makeyoohaste and finish it. I meant to shoot myself not far from here, beyond theyoovillage, and I’d planned to do it at five o’clock in the morning. And Iyoohad a note in my pocket already. I wrote it at Perhotin’s when I loaded myyoopistols. Here’s the letter. Read it! It’s not for you I tell it,” he addedyoocontemptuously. He took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on theyootable. The lawyers read it with curiosity, and, as is usual, added it toyoothe papers connected with the case.yooyoo“And you didn’t even think of washing your hands at Perhotin’s? You wereyoonot afraid then of arousing suspicion?”yooyoo“What suspicion? Suspicion or not, I should have galloped here just theyoosame, and shot myself at five o’clock, and you wouldn’t have been in timeyooto do anything. If it hadn’t been for what’s happened to my father, youyoowould have known nothing about it, and wouldn’t have come here. Oh, it’syoothe devil’s doing. It was the devil murdered father, it was through theyoodevil that you found it out so soon. How did you manage to get here soyooquick? It’s marvelous, a dream!”yooyoo“Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him, you held in youryoohands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money ... ayoobundle of hundred-rouble notes, and that his servant-boy saw it too.”yooyoo“That’s true, gentlemen. I remember it was so.”yooyoo“Now, there’s one little point presents itself. Can you inform us,”yooNikolay Parfenovitch began, with extreme gentleness, “where did you get soyoomuch money all of a sudden, when it appears from the facts, from theyooreckoning of time, that you had not been home?”yooyooThe prosecutor’s brows contracted at the question being asked so plainly,yoobut he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyoo“No, I didn’t go home,” answered Mitya, apparently perfectly composed, butyoolooking at the floor.yooyoo“Allow me then to repeat my question,” Nikolay Parfenovitch went on asyoothough creeping up to the subject. “Where were you able to procure such ayoosum all at once, when by your own confession, at five o’clock the same dayyooyou—”yooyoo“I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin, andyoothen went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she wouldn’tyoogive me, and so on, and all the rest of it,” Mitya interrupted sharply.yoo“Yes, gentlemen, I was in want of it, and suddenly thousands turned up,yooeh? Do you know, gentlemen, you’re both afraid now ‘what if he won’t tellyoous where he got it?’ That’s just how it is. I’m not going to tell you,yoogentlemen. You’ve guessed right. You’ll never know,” said Mitya, chippingyooout each word with extraordinary determination. The lawyers were silentyoofor a moment.yooyoo“You must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital importance for usyooto know,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and suavely.yooyoo“I understand; but still I won’t tell you.”yooyooThe prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner that heyoowas at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he thought it to hisyoointerest, and so on. But in view of the damage he might do himself by hisyoosilence, especially in a case of such importance as—yooyoo“And so on, gentlemen, and so on. Enough! I’ve heard that rigmaroleyoobefore,” Mitya interrupted again. “I can see for myself how important ityoois, and that this is the vital point, and still I won’t say.”yooyoo“What is it to us? It’s not our business, but yours. You are doingyooyourself harm,” observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.yooyoo“You see, gentlemen, joking apart”—Mitya lifted his eyes and looked firmlyyooat them both—“I had an inkling from the first that we should come toyoologgerheads at this point. But at first when I began to give my evidence,yooit was all still far away and misty; it was all floating, and I was soyoosimple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence existingyoobetween us. Now I can see for myself that such confidence is out of theyooquestion, for in any case we were bound to come to this cursedyoostumbling-block. And now we’ve come to it! It’s impossible and there’s anyooend of it! But I don’t blame you. You can’t believe it all simply on myyooword. I understand that, of course.”yooyooHe relapsed into gloomy silence.yooyoo“Couldn’t you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent about theyoochief point, could you not, at the same time, give us some slight hint asyooto the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you toyoorefuse to answer, at a crisis so full of danger to you?”yooyooMitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily.yooyoo“I’m much more good-natured than you think, gentlemen. I’ll tell you theyooreason why and give you that hint, though you don’t deserve it. I won’tyoospeak of that, gentlemen, because it would be a stain on my honor. Theyooanswer to the question where I got the money would expose me to faryoogreater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father, if I hadyoomurdered and robbed him. That’s why I can’t tell you. I can’t for fear ofyoodisgrace. What, gentlemen, are you going to write that down?”yooyoo“Yes, we’ll write it down,” lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyoo“You ought not to write that down about ‘disgrace.’ I only told you thatyooin the goodness of my heart. I needn’t have told you. I made you a presentyooof it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at once. Oh, well, write—writeyoowhat you like,” he concluded, with scornful disgust. “I’m not afraid ofyooyou and I can still hold up my head before you.”yooyoo“And can’t you tell us the nature of that disgrace?” Nikolay Parfenovitchyoohazarded.yooyooThe prosecutor frowned darkly.yooyoo“No, no, _c’est fini_, don’t trouble yourselves. It’s not worth whileyoosoiling one’s hands. I have soiled myself enough through you as it is.yooYou’re not worth it—no one is ... Enough, gentlemen. I’m not going on.”yooyooThis was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insistyoofurther, but from Ippolit Kirillovitch’s eyes he saw that he had not givenyooup hope.yooyoo“Can you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands when youyoowent into Mr. Perhotin’s—how many roubles exactly?”yooyoo“I can’t tell you that.”yooyoo“You spoke to Mr. Perhotin, I believe, of having received three thousandyoofrom Madame Hohlakov.”yooyoo“Perhaps I did. Enough, gentlemen. I won’t say how much I had.”yooyoo“Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what youyoohave done since you arrived?”yooyoo“Oh! you might ask the people here about that. But I’ll tell you if youyoolike.”yooyooHe proceeded to do so, but we won’t repeat his story. He told it dryly andyoocurtly. Of the raptures of his love he said nothing, but told them that heyooabandoned his determination to shoot himself, owing to “new factors in theyoocase.” He told the story without going into motives or details. And thisyootime the lawyers did not worry him much. It was obvious that there was noyooessential point of interest to them here.yooyoo“We shall verify all that. We will come back to it during the examinationyooof the witnesses, which will, of course, take place in your presence,”yoosaid Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion. “And now allow me to request youyooto lay on the table everything in your possession, especially all theyoomoney you still have about you.”yooyoo“My money, gentlemen? Certainly. I understand that that is necessary. I’myoosurprised, indeed, that you haven’t inquired about it before. It’s true Iyoocouldn’t get away anywhere. I’m sitting here where I can be seen. Butyoohere’s my money—count it—take it. That’s all, I think.”yooyooHe turned it all out of his pockets; even the small change—two pieces ofyootwenty copecks—he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket. They counted theyoomoney, which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles, and fortyyoocopecks.yooyoo“And is that all?” asked the investigating lawyer.yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roublesyooat Plotnikovs’. You gave Perhotin ten, your driver twenty, here you lostyootwo hundred, then....”yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up. Mitya helped him readily. Theyyoorecollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning. NikolayyooParfenovitch hurriedly added up the total.yooyoo“With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred atyoofirst?”yooyoo“I suppose so,” snapped Mitya.yooyoo“How is it they all assert there was much more?”yooyoo“Let them assert it.”yooyoo“But you asserted it yourself.”yooyoo“Yes, I did, too.”yooyoo“We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yetyooexamined. Don’t be anxious about your money. It will be properly takenyoocare of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginningyoo... if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved that you have undisputedyooright to it. Well, and now....”yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya firmly that ityoowas his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search “ofyooyour clothes and everything else....”yooyoo“By all means, gentlemen. I’ll turn out all my pockets, if you like.”yooyooAnd he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.yooyoo“It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too.”yooyoo“What! Undress? Ugh! Damn it! Won’t you search me as I am! Can’t you?”yooyoo“It’s utterly impossible, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You must take off youryooclothes.”yooyoo“As you like,” Mitya submitted gloomily; “only, please, not here, butyoobehind the curtains. Who will search them?”yooyoo“Behind the curtains, of course.”yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent. His small face wore anyooexpression of peculiar solemnity.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches MityayooyooyooSomething utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He couldyoonever, even a minute before, have conceived that any one could behave likeyoothat to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was worst of all, there was somethingyoohumiliating in it, and on their side something “supercilious andyooscornful.” It was nothing to take off his coat, but he was asked toyooundress further, or rather not asked but “commanded,” he quite understoodyoothat. From pride and contempt he submitted without a word. Severalyoopeasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of theyoocurtain. “To be ready if force is required,” thought Mitya, “and perhapsyoofor some other reason, too.”yooyoo“Well, must I take off my shirt, too?” he asked sharply, but NikolayyooParfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with the prosecutor inyooexamining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and the cap; and it wasyooevident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny. “They make noyoobones about it,” thought Mitya, “they don’t keep up the most elementaryyoopoliteness.”yooyoo“I ask you for the second time—need I take off my shirt or not?” he said,yoostill more sharply and irritably.yooyoo“Don’t trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,” NikolayyooParfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so ityooseemed to Mitya.yooyooMeantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers.yooThere turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left side at theyooback, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff. There were bloodstainsyooon the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover, in the presence ofyoothe peasant witnesses, passed his fingers along the collar, the cuffs, andyooall the seams of the coat and trousers, obviously looking foryoosomething—money, of course. He didn’t even hide from Mitya his suspicionyoothat he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes.yooyoo“He treats me not as an officer but as a thief,” Mitya muttered toyoohimself. They communicated their ideas to one another with amazingyoofrankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind the curtain,yoofussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitch’s attention toyoothe cap, which they were also fingering.yooyoo“You remember Gridyenko, the copying-clerk,” observed the secretary. “Lastyoosummer he received the wages of the whole office, and pretended to haveyoolost the money when he was drunk. And where was it found? Why, in justyoosuch pipings in his cap. The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up inyoolittle rolls and sewed in the piping.”yooyooBoth the lawyers remembered Gridyenko’s case perfectly, and so laid asideyooMitya’s cap, and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughlyyooexamined later.yooyoo“Excuse me,” cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing that the rightyoocuff of Mitya’s shirt was turned in, and covered with blood, “excuse me,yoowhat’s that, blood?”yooyoo“Yes,” Mitya jerked out.yooyoo“That is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?”yooyooMitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking afteryooGrigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands atyooPerhotin’s.yooyoo“You must take off your shirt, too. That’s very important as materialyooevidence.”yooyooMitya flushed red and flew into a rage.yooyoo“What, am I to stay naked?” he shouted.yooyoo“Don’t disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile take offyooyour socks.”yooyoo“You’re not joking? Is that really necessary?” Mitya’s eyes flashed.yooyoo“We are in no mood for joking,” answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly.yooyoo“Well, if I must—” muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed, he tookyoooff his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were clothed, while he wasyoonaked, and strange to say, when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty inyootheir presence, and was almost ready to believe himself that he wasyooinferior to them, and that now they had a perfect right to despise him.yooyoo“When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when one’s theyooonly one undressed and everybody is looking, it’s degrading,” he keptyoorepeating to himself, again and again. “It’s like a dream, I’ve sometimesyoodreamed of being in such degrading positions.” It was a misery to him toyootake off his socks. They were very dirty, and so were his underclothes,yooand now every one could see it. And what was worse, he disliked his feet.yooAll his life he had thought both his big toes hideous. He particularlyyooloathed the coarse, flat, crooked nail on the right one, and now theyyoowould all see it. Feeling intolerably ashamed made him, at once andyoointentionally, rougher. He pulled off his shirt, himself.yooyoo“Would you like to look anywhere else if you’re not ashamed to?”yooyoo“No, there’s no need to, at present.”yooyoo“Well, am I to stay naked like this?” he added savagely.yooyoo“Yes, that can’t be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down here for ayoowhile. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed, and I ... I’ll seeyooto all this.”yooyooAll the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the search wasyoodrawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and the clothes wereyoocarried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too. Mitya was leftyooalone with the peasants, who stood in silence, never taking their eyes offyoohim. Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feetyoostuck out, and he couldn’t pull the quilt over so as to cover them.yooNikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time, “an insufferableyootime.” “He thinks of me as a puppy,” thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth.yoo“That rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgustsyoohim to see me naked!”yooyooMitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and returnedyooto him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came backyoowith quite different clothes, brought in behind him by a peasant.yooyoo“Here are clothes for you,” he observed airily, seeming well satisfiedyoowith the success of his mission. “Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided theseyoofor this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt. Luckily he had themyooall in his trunk. You can keep your own socks and underclothes.”yooyooMitya flew into a passion.yooyoo“I won’t have other people’s clothes!” he shouted menacingly, “give me myyooown!”yooyoo“It’s impossible!”yooyoo“Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!”yooyooIt was a long time before they could persuade him. But they succeededyoosomehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him that his clothes,yoobeing stained with blood, must be “included with the other materialyooevidence,” and that they “had not even the right to let him have them nowyoo... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.” Mitya atyoolast understood this. He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedlyyoodressed himself. He merely observed, as he put them on, that the clothesyoowere much better than his old ones, and that he disliked “gaining by theyoochange.” The coat was, besides, “ridiculously tight. Am I to be dressed upyoolike a fool ... for your amusement?”yooyooThey urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov was onlyyooa little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too long. Butyoothe coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders.yooyoo“Damn it all! I can hardly button it,” Mitya grumbled. “Be so good as toyootell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn’t ask for his clothes, and it’s notyoomy doing that they’ve dressed me up like a clown.”yooyoo“He understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend you hisyooclothes, but sorry about all this business,” mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyoo“Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting here?”yooyooHe was asked to go back to the “other room.” Mitya went in, scowling withyooanger, and trying to avoid looking at any one. Dressed in another man’syooclothes he felt himself disgraced, even in the eyes of the peasants, andyooof Trifon Borissovitch, whose face appeared, for some reason, in theyoodoorway, and vanished immediately. “He’s come to look at me dressed up,”yoothought Mitya. He sat down on the same chair as before. He had an absurdyoonightmarish feeling, as though he were out of his mind.yooyoo“Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That’s all that’s left foryooyou,” he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor. He wouldyoonot turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he disdained to speak to him.yooyoo“He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out on purposeyooto show every one how dirty they were—the scoundrel!”yooyoo“Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,” observedyooNikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya’s question.yooyoo“Yes,” said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting onyoosomething.yooyoo“We’ve done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” NikolayyooParfenovitch went on, “but having received from you such an uncompromisingyoorefusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the moneyyoofound upon you, we are, at the present moment—”yooyoo“What is the stone in your ring?” Mitya interrupted suddenly, as thoughyooawakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three large ringsyooadorning Nikolay Parfenovitch’s right hand.yooyoo“Ring?” repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.yooyoo“Yes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins in it,yoowhat stone is that?” Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.yooyoo“That’s a smoky topaz,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling. “Would youyoolike to look at it? I’ll take it off ...”yooyoo“No, don’t take it off,” cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking up, andyooangry with himself. “Don’t take it off ... there’s no need.... Damn it!...yooGentlemen, you’ve sullied my heart! Can you suppose that I would concealyooit from you, if I had really killed my father, that I would shuffle, lie,yooand hide myself? No, that’s not like Dmitri Karamazov, that he couldn’tyoodo, and if I were guilty, I swear I shouldn’t have waited for your coming,yooor for the sunrise as I meant at first, but should have killed myselfyoobefore this, without waiting for the dawn! I know that about myself now. Iyoocouldn’t have learnt so much in twenty years as I’ve found out in thisyooaccursed night!... And should I have been like this on this night, and atyoothis moment, sitting with you, could I have talked like this, could I haveyoomoved like this, could I have looked at you and at the world like this, ifyooI had really been the murderer of my father, when the very thought ofyoohaving accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night—not fromyoofear—oh, not simply from fear of your punishment! The disgrace of it! Andyooyou expect me to be open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing andyoobelieve in nothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you anotheryoonasty thing I’ve done, another disgrace, even if that would save me fromyooyour accusation! No, better Siberia! The man who opened the door to myyoofather and went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed him. Who was he?yooI’m racking my brains and can’t think who. But I can tell you it was notyooDmitri Karamazov, and that’s all I can tell you, and that’s enough,yooenough, leave me alone.... Exile me, punish me, but don’t bother me anyyoomore. I’ll say no more. Call your witnesses!”yooyooMitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to beyooabsolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor watched him the wholeyootime and only when he had ceased speaking, observed, as though it were theyoomost ordinary thing, with the most frigid and composed air:yooyoo“Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may as wellyooinform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of evidence ofyoothe greatest importance both to you and to us, that has been given us byyooGrigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery, he clearly andyooemphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that when, on coming outyooto the steps, and hearing a noise in the garden, he made up his mind to goyoointo it through the little gate which stood open, before he noticed youyoorunning, as you have told us already, in the dark from the open windowyoowhere you saw your father, he, Grigory, glanced to the left, and, whileyoonoticing the open window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him,yoothe door, standing wide open—that door which you have stated to have beenyooshut the whole time you were in the garden. I will not conceal from youyoothat Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you mustyoohave run from that door, though, of course, he did not see you do so withyoohis own eyes, since he only noticed you first some distance away in theyoogarden, running towards the fence.”yooyooMitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech.yooyoo“Nonsense!” he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, “it’s a barefaced lie. Heyoocouldn’t have seen the door open because it was shut. He’s lying!”yooyoo“I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement. He doesyoonot waver. He adheres to it. We’ve cross-examined him several times.”yooyoo“Precisely. I have cross-examined him several times,” Nikolay Parfenovitchyooconfirmed warmly.yooyoo“It’s false, false! It’s either an attempt to slander me, or theyoohallucination of a madman,” Mitya still shouted. “He’s simply raving, fromyooloss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it when he came to....yooHe’s raving.”yooyoo“Yes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after hisyooinjuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden from theyoolodge.”yooyoo“But it’s false, it’s false! It can’t be so! He’s slandering me fromyoospite.... He couldn’t have seen it ... I didn’t come from the door,”yoogasped Mitya.yooyooThe prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to himyooimpressively:yooyoo“Confront him with it.”yooyoo“Do you recognize this object?”yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick officialyooenvelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The envelope wasyooempty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with open eyes.yooyoo“It ... it must be that envelope of my father’s, the envelope thatyoocontained the three thousand roubles ... and if there’s inscribed on it,yooallow me, ‘For my little chicken’ ... yes—three thousand!” he shouted, “doyooyou see, three thousand, do you see?”yooyoo“Of course, we see. But we didn’t find the money in it. It was empty, andyoolying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.”yooyooFor some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.yooyoo“Gentlemen, it’s Smerdyakov!” he shouted suddenly, at the top of hisyoovoice. “It’s he who’s murdered him! He’s robbed him! No one else knewyoowhere the old man hid the envelope. It’s Smerdyakov, that’s clear, now!”yooyoo“But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow.”yooyoo“I never knew it. I’ve never seen it. This is the first time I’ve lookedyooat it. I’d only heard of it from Smerdyakov.... He was the only one whoyooknew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn’t know ...” Mitya wasyoocompletely breathless.yooyoo“But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceasedyoofather’s pillow. You especially stated that it was under the pillow, soyooyou must have known it.”yooyoo“We’ve got it written down,” confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyoo“Nonsense! It’s absurd! I’d no idea it was under the pillow. And perhapsyooit wasn’t under the pillow at all.... It was just a chance guess that ityoowas under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov say? Have you asked him whereyooit was? What does Smerdyakov say? that’s the chief point.... And I wentyooout of my way to tell lies against myself.... I told you without thinkingyoothat it was under the pillow, and now you— Oh, you know how one says theyoowrong thing, without meaning it. No one knew but Smerdyakov, onlyyooSmerdyakov, and no one else.... He didn’t even tell me where it was! Butyooit’s his doing, his doing; there’s no doubt about it, he murdered him,yoothat’s as clear as daylight now,” Mitya exclaimed more and moreyoofrantically, repeating himself incoherently, and growing more and moreyooexasperated and excited. “You must understand that, and arrest him atyooonce.... He must have killed him while I was running away and whileyooGrigory was unconscious, that’s clear now.... He gave the signal andyoofather opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal, and withoutyoothe signal father would never have opened the door....”yooyoo“But you’re again forgetting the circumstance,” the prosecutor observed,yoostill speaking with the same restraint, though with a note of triumph,yoo“that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood openyoowhen you were there, while you were in the garden....”yooyoo“The door, the door,” muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless at theyooprosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were silent.yooyoo“Yes, the door!... It’s a nightmare! God is against me!” he exclaimed,yoostaring before him in complete stupefaction.yooyoo“Come, you see,” the prosecutor went on with dignity, “and you can judgeyoofor yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we have the evidence ofyoothe open door from which you ran out, a fact which overwhelms you and us.yooOn the other side your incomprehensible, persistent, and, so to speak,yooobdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained theyoomoney which was so suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hoursyooearlier, on your own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of tenyooroubles! In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are we toyoobelieve, and what can we depend upon? And don’t accuse us of beingyoo‘frigid, cynical, scoffing people,’ who are incapable of believing in theyoogenerous impulses of your heart.... Try to enter into our position ...”yooyooMitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.yooyoo“Very well!” he exclaimed suddenly. “I will tell you my secret. I’ll tellyooyou where I got the money!... I’ll reveal my shame, that I may not have toyooblame myself or you hereafter.”yooyoo“And believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” put in Nikolay Parfenovitch, in ayoovoice of almost pathetic delight, “that every sincere and completeyooconfession on your part at this moment may, later on, have an immenseyooinfluence in your favor, and may, indeed, moreover—”yooyooBut the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and he checkedyoohimself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard him.yooyooyooyooChapter VII. Mitya’s Great Secret. Received With Hissesyooyooyoo“Gentlemen,” he began, still in the same agitation, “I want to make a fullyooconfession: that money was _my own_.” The lawyers’ faces lengthened. Thatyoowas not at all what they expected.yooyoo“How do you mean?” faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch, “when at five o’clock onyoothe same day, from your own confession—”yooyoo“Damn five o’clock on the same day and my own confession! That’s nothingyooto do with it now! That money was my own, my own, that is, stolen by meyoo... not mine, I mean, but stolen by me, and it was fifteen hundredyooroubles, and I had it on me all the time, all the time ...”yooyoo“But where did you get it?”yooyoo“I took it off my neck, gentlemen, off this very neck ... it was here,yooround my neck, sewn up in a rag, and I’d had it round my neck a long time,yooit’s a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace!”yooyoo“And from whom did you ... appropriate it?”yooyoo“You mean, ‘steal it’? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider that Iyoopractically stole it, but, if you prefer, I ‘appropriated it.’ I consideryooI stole it. And last night I stole it finally.”yooyoo“Last night? But you said that it’s a month since you ... obtained it?...”yooyoo“Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don’t be uneasy. Iyoodidn’t steal it from my father, but from her. Let me tell you withoutyoointerrupting. It’s hard to do, you know. You see, a month ago, I was sentyoofor by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my betrothed. Do you know her?”yooyoo“Yes, of course.”yooyoo“I know you know her. She’s a noble creature, noblest of the noble. Butyooshe has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long ... and hated me with goodyooreason, good reason!”yooyoo“Katerina Ivanovna!” Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder. Theyooprosecutor, too, stared.yooyoo“Oh, don’t take her name in vain! I’m a scoundrel to bring her into it.yooYes, I’ve seen that she hated me ... a long while.... From the very first,yooeven that evening at my lodging ... but enough, enough. You’re unworthyyooeven to know of that. No need of that at all.... I need only tell you thatyooshe sent for me a month ago, gave me three thousand roubles to send off toyooher sister and another relation in Moscow (as though she couldn’t haveyoosent it off herself!) and I ... it was just at that fatal moment in myyoolife when I ... well, in fact, when I’d just come to love another, her,yooshe’s sitting down below now, Grushenka. I carried her off here to Mokroeyoothen, and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand, but theyooother half I kept on me. Well, I’ve kept that other half, that fifteenyoohundred, like a locket round my neck, but yesterday I undid it, and spentyooit. What’s left of it, eight hundred roubles, is in your hands now,yooNikolay Parfenovitch. That’s the change out of the fifteen hundred I hadyooyesterday.”yooyoo“Excuse me. How’s that? Why, when you were here a month ago you spentyoothree thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows that.”yooyoo“Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one count it?”yooyoo“Why, you told every one yourself that you’d spent exactly threeyoothousand.”yooyoo“It’s true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town said so.yooAnd here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three thousand. Yet Iyoodidn’t spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred. And the other fifteenyoohundred I sewed into a little bag. That’s how it was, gentlemen. That’syoowhere I got that money yesterday....”yooyoo“This is almost miraculous,” murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.yooyoo“Allow me to inquire,” observed the prosecutor at last, “have you informedyooany one whatever of this circumstance before, I mean that you had fifteenyoohundred left about you a month ago?”yooyoo“I told no one.”yooyoo“That’s strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?”yooyoo“Absolutely no one. No one and nobody.”yooyoo“What was your reason for this reticence? What was your motive for makingyoosuch a secret of it? To be more precise: You have told us at last youryoosecret, in your words, so ‘disgraceful,’ though in reality—that is, ofyoocourse, comparatively speaking—this action, that is, the appropriation ofyoothree thousand roubles belonging to some one else, and, of course, onlyyoofor a time is, in my view at least, only an act of the greatestyoorecklessness and not so disgraceful, when one takes into considerationyooyour character.... Even admitting that it was an action in the highestyoodegree discreditable, still, discreditable is not ‘disgraceful.’... Manyyoopeople have already guessed, during this last month, about the threeyoothousand of Katerina Ivanovna’s, that you have spent, and I heard theyoolegend myself, apart from your confession.... Mihail Makarovitch, foryooinstance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, butyoothe gossip of the whole town. There are indications, too, if I am notyoomistaken, that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that theyoomoney was Katerina Ivanovna’s, and so, it’s extremely surprising to meyoothat hitherto, that is, up to the present moment, you have made such anyooextraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by, apparentlyyooconnecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret.... It’s not easyyooto believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such ayoosecret.... You cried out, just now, that Siberia would be better thanyooconfessing it ...”yooyooThe prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not conceal hisyoovexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all his accumulatedyoospleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without choosing words.yooyoo“It’s not the fifteen hundred that’s the disgrace, but that I put it apartyoofrom the rest of the three thousand,” said Mitya firmly.yooyoo“Why?” smiled the prosecutor irritably. “What is there disgraceful, toyooyour thinking, in your having set aside half of the three thousand you hadyoodiscreditably, if you prefer, ‘disgracefully,’ appropriated? Your takingyoothe three thousand is more important than what you did with it. And by theyooway, why did you do that—why did you set apart that half, for whatyoopurpose, for what object did you do it? Can you explain that to us?”yooyoo“Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!” cried Mitya. “I put ityooaside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and to beyoocalculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going onyooa whole month.”yooyoo“It’s incomprehensible.”yooyoo“I wonder at you. But I’ll make it clearer. Perhaps it really isyooincomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate threeyoothousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I spend it all,yooand next morning I go to her and say, ‘Katya, I’ve done wrong, I’veyoosquandered your three thousand,’ well, is that right? No, it’s notyooright—it’s dishonest and cowardly, I’m a beast, with no more self-controlyoothan a beast, that’s so, isn’t it? But still I’m not a thief? Not ayoodownright thief, you’ll admit! I squandered it, but I didn’t steal it. Nowyooa second, rather more favorable alternative: follow me carefully, or I mayyooget confused again—my head’s going round—and so, for the secondyooalternative: I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand,yoothat is, only half. Next day I go and take that half to her: ‘Katya, takeyoothis fifteen hundred from me, I’m a low beast, and an untrustworthyyooscoundrel, for I’ve wasted half the money, and I shall waste this, too, soyookeep me from temptation!’ Well, what of that alternative? I should be ayoobeast and a scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a thief, notyooaltogether a thief, or I should not have brought back what was left, butyoohave kept that, too. She would see at once that since I brought back half,yooI should pay back what I’d spent, that I should never give up trying to,yoothat I should work to get it and pay it back. So in that case I should beyooa scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!”yooyoo“I admit that there is a certain distinction,” said the prosecutor, with ayoocold smile. “But it’s strange that you see such a vital difference.”yooyoo“Yes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel, and perhapsyooevery man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a thief, it takes anyooarch-scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don’t know how to make theseyoofine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel, that’s myyooconviction. Listen, I carry the money about me a whole month, I may makeyooup my mind to give it back to-morrow, and I’m a scoundrel no longer, but Iyoocannot make up my mind, you see, though I’m making up my mind every day,yooand every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month Iyoocan’t bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to your thinking, is thatyooright?”yooyoo“Certainly, that’s not right, that I can quite understand, and that Iyoodon’t dispute,” answered the prosecutor with reserve. “And let us give upyooall discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if you will beyooso kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that you have still notyootold us, altogether we’ve asked you, why, in the first place, you halvedyoothe money, squandering one half and hiding the other? For what purposeyooexactly did you hide it, what did you mean to do with that fifteenyoohundred? I insist upon that question, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”yooyoo“Yes, of course!” cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead; “forgiveyoome, I’m worrying you, and am not explaining the chief point, or you’dyoounderstand in a minute, for it’s just the motive of it that’s theyoodisgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man, my dead father. Heyoowas always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna, and I was jealous; I thoughtyoothen that she was hesitating between me and him. So I kept thinking everyyooday, suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden, suppose sheyoowere to leave off tormenting me, and were suddenly to say to me, ‘I loveyooyou, not him; take me to the other end of the world.’ And I’d only fortyyoocopecks; how could I take her away, what could I do? Why, I’d be lost. Youyoosee, I didn’t know her then, I didn’t understand her, I thought she wantedyoomoney, and that she wouldn’t forgive my poverty. And so I fiendishlyyoocounted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it up, calculating onyooit, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had sewn it up, I went offyooto get drunk on the rest. Yes, that was base. Do you understand now?”yooyooBoth the lawyers laughed aloud.yooyoo“I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to haveyoosquandered it all,” chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, “for after all whatyoodoes it amount to?”yooyoo“Why, that I stole it, that’s what it amounts to! Oh, God, you horrify meyooby not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn upyooround my neck, every day and every hour I said to myself, ‘You’re a thief!yooyou’re a thief!’ Yes, that’s why I’ve been so savage all this month,yoothat’s why I fought in the tavern, that’s why I attacked my father, it wasyoobecause I felt I was a thief. I couldn’t make up my mind, I didn’t dareyooeven to tell Alyosha, my brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I wasyoosuch a scoundrel and such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carriedyooit I said to myself at the same time every hour: ‘No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,yooyou may yet not be a thief.’ Why? Because I might go next day and pay backyoothat fifteen hundred to Katya. And only yesterday I made up my mind toyootear my amulet off my neck, on my way from Fenya’s to Perhotin. I hadn’tyoobeen able till that moment to bring myself to it. And it was only when Iyootore it off that I became a downright thief, a thief and a dishonest manyoofor the rest of my life. Why? Because, with that I destroyed, too, myyoodream of going to Katya and saying, ‘I’m a scoundrel, but not a thief!’ Doyooyou understand now? Do you understand?”yooyoo“What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?” Nikolay Parfenovitchyoointerrupted.yooyoo“Why? It’s absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to die at fiveyooo’clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made no differenceyoowhether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see it’s not so, it turnsyooout that it does make a difference. Believe me, gentlemen, what hasyootortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I’dyookilled the old servant, and that I was in danger of Siberia just when myyoolove was being rewarded, and Heaven was open to me again. Oh, that didyootorture me, but not in the same way: not so much as the damnedyooconsciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last andyoospent it, and had become a downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell youyooagain, with a bleeding heart, I have learnt a great deal this night. Iyoohave learnt that it’s not only impossible to live a scoundrel, butyooimpossible to die a scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest....”yooyooMitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in spite of hisyoobeing intensely excited.yooyoo“I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” the prosecutoryoosaid slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone. “But all this, ifyooyou’ll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves, in my opinion ... youryoooverwrought nerves, that’s what it is. And why, for instance, should youyoonot have saved yourself such misery for almost a month, by going andyooreturning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you?yooAnd why could you not have explained things to her, and in view of youryooposition, which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have hadyoorecourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one’s mind,yoothat is, after honorably confessing your errors to her, why could you notyoohave asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses, which, withyooher generous heart, she would certainly not have refused you in youryoodistress, especially if it had been with some guarantee, or even on theyoosecurity you offered to the merchant Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? Iyoosuppose you still regard that security as of value?”yooyooMitya suddenly crimsoned.yooyoo“Surely you don’t think me such an out and out scoundrel as that? Youyoocan’t be speaking in earnest?” he said, with indignation, looking theyooprosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to believe his ears.yooyoo“I assure you I’m in earnest.... Why do you imagine I’m not serious?” Ityoowas the prosecutor’s turn to be surprised.yooyoo“Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you areyootorturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I’ll confess all myyooinfernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and you’ll be surprisedyooyourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passionsyoocan sink. You must know that I already had that plan myself, that plan youyoospoke of, just now, prosecutor! Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had thatyoothought in my mind all this current month, so that I was on the point ofyoodeciding to go to Katya—I was mean enough for that. But to go to her, toyootell her of my treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out,yoofor the expenses of that treachery, to beg for money from her, Katya (toyoobeg, do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to run away with theyooother, the rival, who hated and insulted her—to think of it! You must beyoomad, prosecutor!”yooyoo“Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ... of thatyoofeminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case, as youyooassert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,” said theyooprosecutor, smiling.yooyoo“But that would have been so infamous!” Mitya brought his fist down on theyootable fiercely. “That would have been filthy beyond everything! Yes, doyooyou know that she might have given me that money, yes, and she would haveyoogiven it, too; she’d have been certain to give it, to be revenged on me,yooshe’d have given it to satisfy her vengeance, to show her contempt for me,yoofor hers is an infernal nature, too, and she’s a woman of great wrath. I’dyoohave taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have takenyooit, and then, for the rest of my life ... oh, God! Forgive me, gentlemen,yooI’m making such an outcry because I’ve had that thought in my mind soyoolately, only the day before yesterday, that night when I was having allyoothat bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards yesterday, all day yesterday, Iyooremember, till that happened ...”yooyoo“Till what happened?” put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively, but Mityayoodid not hear it.yooyoo“I have made you an awful confession,” Mitya said gloomily in conclusion.yoo“You must appreciate it, and what’s more, you must respect it, for if not,yooif that leaves your souls untouched, then you’ve simply no respect for me,yoogentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die of shame at having confessedyooit to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot myself! Yes, I see, I see alreadyyoothat you don’t believe me. What, you want to write that down, too?” heyoocried in dismay.yooyoo“Yes, what you said just now,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking at himyooin surprise, “that is, that up to the last hour you were stillyoocontemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her.... Iyooassure you, that’s a very important piece of evidence for us, DmitriyooFyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you,yooparticularly important for you.”yooyoo“Have mercy, gentlemen!” Mitya flung up his hands. “Don’t write that,yooanyway; have some shame. Here I’ve torn my heart asunder before you, andyooyou seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves....yooOh, my God!”yooyooIn despair he hid his face in his hands.yooyoo“Don’t worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” observed the prosecutor,yoo“everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards, andyoowhat you don’t agree to we’ll alter as you like. But now I’ll ask you oneyoolittle question for the second time. Has no one, absolutely no one, heardyoofrom you of that money you sewed up? That, I must tell you, is almostyooimpossible to believe.”yooyoo“No one, no one, I told you so before, or you’ve not understood anything!yooLet me alone!”yooyoo“Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there’s plenty ofyootime for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnessesyoothat you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhereyooabout the three thousand you’d spent here; three thousand, not fifteenyoohundred. And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had yesterday,yooyou gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousandyoowith you.”yooyoo“You’ve got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred witnesses,yootwo hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!” cried Mitya.yooyoo“Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word _all_ meansyoosomething.”yooyoo“It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.”yooyoo“But what need had you to ‘talk rot,’ as you call it?”yooyoo“The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so muchyoomoney.... To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps ... yes,yoothat was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question?yooWell, I told a fib, and that was the end of it, once I’d said it, I didn’tyoocare to correct it. What does a man tell lies for sometimes?”yooyoo“That’s very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes a manyootell lies,” observed the prosecutor impressively. “Tell me, though, wasyoothat ‘amulet,’ as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?”yooyoo“No, not big.”yooyoo“How big, for instance?”yooyoo“If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half, that would be the size.”yooyoo“You’d better show us the remains of it. You must have them somewhere.”yooyoo“Damnation, what nonsense! I don’t know where they are.”yooyoo“But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck? According toyooyour own evidence you didn’t go home.”yooyoo“When I was going from Fenya’s to Perhotin’s, on the way I tore it off myyooneck and took out the money.”yooyoo“In the dark?”yooyoo“What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in one minute.”yooyoo“Without scissors, in the street?”yooyoo“In the market-place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an old rag. Ityoowas torn in a minute.”yooyoo“Where did you put it afterwards?”yooyoo“I dropped it there.”yooyoo“Where was it, exactly?”yooyoo“In the market-place, in the market-place! The devil knows whereabouts.yooWhat do you want to know for?”yooyoo“That’s extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would be materialyooevidence in your favor. How is it you don’t understand that? Who helpedyooyou to sew it up a month ago?”yooyoo“No one helped me. I did it myself.”yooyoo“Can you sew?”yooyoo“A soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed to do that.”yooyoo“Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you sewed theyoomoney?”yooyoo“Are you laughing at me?”yooyoo“Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”yooyoo“I don’t know where I got the rag from—somewhere, I suppose.”yooyoo“I should have thought you couldn’t have forgotten it?”yooyoo“Upon my word, I don’t remember. I might have torn a bit off my linen.”yooyoo“That’s very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to-morrow theyooshirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag. What sort of rag wasyooit, cloth or linen?”yooyoo“Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe I didn’t tearyooit off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe I sewed it up in ayoocap of my landlady’s.”yooyoo“In your landlady’s cap?”yooyoo“Yes. I took it from her.”yooyoo“How did you get it?”yooyoo“You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to wipe my penyooon. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless rag. I tore ityooup, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it. I believe it was in thatyoovery rag I sewed them. An old piece of calico, washed a thousand times.”yooyoo“And you remember that for certain now?”yooyoo“I don’t know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap. But, hangyooit, what does it matter?”yooyoo“In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost?”yooyoo“No, she won’t, she didn’t miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you, an oldyoorag not worth a farthing.”yooyoo“And where did you get the needle and thread?”yooyoo“I’ll stop now. I won’t say any more. Enough of it!” said Mitya, losingyoohis temper at last.yooyoo“It’s strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threwyoothe pieces in the market-place.”yooyoo“Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and perhapsyooyou’ll find it,” said Mitya, sneering. “Enough, gentlemen, enough!” heyoodecided, in an exhausted voice. “I see you don’t believe me! Not for ayoomoment! It’s my fault, not yours. I ought not to have been so ready. Why,yoowhy did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you? It’s a joke toyooyou. I see that from your eyes. You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing ayoohymn of triumph if you can.... Damn you, you torturers!”yooyooHe bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were silent.yooA minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost vacantly. Hisyooface now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and he sat mute and passiveyooas though hardly conscious of what was happening. In the meantime they hadyooto finish what they were about. They had immediately to begin examiningyoothe witnesses. It was by now eight o’clock in the morning. The lights hadyoobeen extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had beenyoocontinually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation hadyoobeen going on, had now both gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked veryyootired. It was a wretched morning, the whole sky was overcast, and the rainyoostreamed down in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.yooyoo“May I look out of the window?” he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly.yooyoo“Oh, as much as you like,” the latter replied.yooyooMitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed against its littleyoogreenish panes. He could see the muddy road just below the house, andyoofarther away, in the rain and mist, a row of poor, black, dismal huts,yoolooking even blacker and poorer in the rain. Mitya thought of “Phœbus theyoogolden-haired,” and how he had meant to shoot himself at his first ray.yoo“Perhaps it would be even better on a morning like this,” he thought withyooa smile, and suddenly, flinging his hand downwards, he turned to hisyoo“torturers.”yooyoo“Gentlemen,” he cried, “I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me about her,yooI beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me? She’s innocent, youyooknow, she was out of her mind when she cried last night ‘It’s all myyoofault!’ She’s done nothing, nothing! I’ve been grieving over her all nightyooas I sat with you.... Can’t you, won’t you tell me what you are going toyoodo with her now?”yooyoo“You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,”yoothe prosecutor answered at once, with evident alacrity. “We have, so far,yoono grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you are so interested. Iyootrust that it may be the same in the later development of the case.... Onyoothe contrary, we’ll do everything that lies in our power in that matter.yooSet your mind completely at rest.”yooyoo“Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight-forwardyoopeople in spite of everything. You’ve taken a load off my heart.... Well,yoowhat are we to do now? I’m ready.”yooyoo“Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the witnessesyoowithout delay. That must be done in your presence and therefore—”yooyoo“Shouldn’t we have some tea first?” interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch, “Iyoothink we’ve deserved it!”yooyooThey decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch had, noyoodoubt, gone down to get some) they would have a glass and then “go on andyooon,” putting off their proper breakfast until a more favorableyooopportunity. Tea really was ready below, and was soon brought up. Mitya atyoofirst refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him,yoobut afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily. He lookedyoosurprisingly exhausted. It might have been supposed from his Herculeanyoostrength that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violentyooemotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt that he couldyoohardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the objects about himyooseemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. “A little more and I shallyoobegin raving,” he said to himself.yooyooyooyooChapter VIII. The Evidence Of The Witnesses. The BabeyooyooyooThe examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue our storyyooin such detail as before. And so we will not dwell on how NikolayyooParfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must give hisyooevidence in accordance with truth and conscience, and that he wouldyooafterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath, how every witness wasyoocalled upon to sign the protocol of his evidence, and so on. We will onlyyoonote that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was theyooquestion of the three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum spent here,yooat Mokroe, by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before, three thousandyooor fifteen hundred? And again had he spent three thousand or fifteenyoohundred yesterday? Alas, all the evidence given by every one turned out toyoobe against Mitya. There was not one in his favor, and some witnessesyoointroduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of his, Mitya’s,yoostory.yooyooThe first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not in theyooleast abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the contrary, anyooair of stern and severe indignation with the accused, which gave him anyooappearance of truthfulness and personal dignity. He spoke little, and withyooreserve, waited to be questioned, answered precisely and deliberately.yooFirmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness that the sum spent a monthyoobefore could not have been less than three thousand, that all the peasantsyooabout here would testify that they had heard the sum of three thousandyoomentioned by Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself. “What a lot of money he flungyooaway on the gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand, I daresay, on themyooalone.”yooyoo“I don’t believe I gave them five hundred,” was Mitya’s gloomy comment onyoothis. “It’s a pity I didn’t count the money at the time, but I wasyoodrunk....”yooyooMitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He listenedyoogloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though he would say:yooyoo“Oh, say what you like. It makes no difference now.”yooyoo“More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” retorted TrifonyooBorissovitch firmly. “You flung it about at random and they picked it up.yooThey were a rascally, thievish lot, horse-stealers, they’ve been drivenyooaway from here, or maybe they’d bear witness themselves how much they gotyoofrom you. I saw the sum in your hands, myself—count it I didn’t, youyoodidn’t let me, that’s true enough—but by the look of it I should say ityoowas far more than fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred, indeed! We’ve seenyoomoney too. We can judge of amounts....”yooyooAs for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch hadyootold him, as soon as he arrived, that he had brought three thousand withyoohim.yooyoo“Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?” replied Mitya. “Surely Iyoodidn’t declare so positively that I’d brought three thousand?”yooyoo“You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey. Andreyyoohimself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when you wereyootreating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you would leave youryoosixth thousand here—that is with what you spent before, we mustyoounderstand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov, too,yoowas standing beside you at the time. Maybe he’d remember it....”yooyooThe evidence as to the “sixth” thousand made an extraordinary impressionyooon the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new mode of reckoning;yoothree and three made six, three thousand then and three now made six, thatyoowas clear.yooyooThey questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch, Stepanyooand Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov. The peasants and the driveryoounhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch’s evidence. They noted down,yoowith particular care, Andrey’s account of the conversation he had had withyooMitya on the road: “ ‘Where,’ says he, ‘am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going,yooto heaven or to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not?’ ”yooyooThe psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile, andyooended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri Fyodorovitchyoowould go should be “included in the case.”yooyooKalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill-humored, andyoohe spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in hisyoolife, though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every dayyoofor a long time past. He began by saying that “he knew nothing about ityooand didn’t want to.” But it appeared that he had heard of the “sixth”yoothousand, and he admitted that he had been standing close by at theyoomoment. As far as he could see he “didn’t know” how much money Mitya hadyooin his hands. He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards. In reply toyooreiterated questions he stated that, after the Poles had been turned out,yooMitya’s position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved, andyoothat she had said that she loved him. He spoke of Agrafena Alexandrovnayoowith reserve and respect, as though she had been a lady of the bestyoosociety, and did not once allow himself to call her Grushenka. In spite ofyoothe young man’s obvious repugnance at giving evidence, IppolityooKirillovitch examined him at great length, and only from him learnt allyoothe details of what made up Mitya’s “romance,” so to say, on that night.yooMitya did not once pull Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go,yooand he left the room with unconcealed indignation.yooyooThe Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed in their room,yoothey had not slept all night, and on the arrival of the police officersyoothey hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that they would certainly beyoosent for. They gave their evidence with dignity, though not without someyoouneasiness. The little Pole turned out to be a retired official of theyootwelfth class, who had served in Siberia as a veterinary surgeon. His nameyoowas Mussyalovitch. Pan Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificatedyoodentist. Although Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on enteringyoothe room they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who wasyoostanding on one side, taking him in their ignorance for the most importantyooperson and in command, and addressed him at every word as “Pan Colonel.”yooOnly after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch himself, they graspedyoothat they had to address their answers to Nikolay Parfenovitch only. Ityooturned out that they could speak Russian quite correctly except for theiryooaccent in some words. Of his relations with Grushenka, past and present,yooPan Mussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused atyooonce and declared that he would not allow the “scoundrel” to speak likeyoothat in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to theyooword “scoundrel” and begged that it should be put down in the protocol.yooMitya fumed with rage.yooyoo“He’s a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And put down, too,yoothat, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he’s a scoundrel!” heyoocried.yooyooThough Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he showed theyoomost praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly reprimanding Mitya,yoohe cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the case, andyoohastened to pass to what was essential. One piece of evidence given by theyooPoles roused special interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that veryyooroom, Mitya had tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered himyoothree thousand roubles to resign his claims, seven hundred roubles down,yooand the remaining two thousand three hundred “to be paid next day in theyootown.” He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole sum with him atyooMokroe, but that his money was in the town. Mitya observed hotly that heyoohad not said that he would be sure to pay him the remainder next day inyoothe town. But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed the statement, and Mitya, afteryoothinking for a moment admitted, frowning, that it must have been as theyooPoles stated, that he had been excited at the time, and might indeed haveyoosaid so.yooyooThe prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It seemed toyooestablish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact, base this deductionyooon it) that half, or a part of, the three thousand that had come intoyooMitya’s hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town, oryooeven, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe. This would explain theyoocircumstance, so baffling for the prosecution, that only eight hundredyooroubles were to be found in Mitya’s hands. This circumstance had been theyooone piece of evidence which, insignificant as it was, had hitherto told,yooto some extent, in Mitya’s favor. Now this one piece of evidence in hisyoofavor had broken down. In answer to the prosecutor’s inquiry, where heyoowould have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles, since heyoohimself had denied having more than fifteen hundred, Mitya confidentlyyooreplied that he had meant to offer the “little chap,” not money, but ayooformal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village of Tchermashnya,yoothose rights which he had already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov.yooThe prosecutor positively smiled at the “innocence of this subterfuge.”yooyoo“And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute foryootwo thousand three hundred roubles in cash?”yooyoo“He certainly would have accepted it,” Mitya declared warmly. “Why, lookyoohere, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four or six, for it. Heyoowould have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on to the job, and might haveyoogot, not three thousand, but the whole property out of the old man.”yooyooThe evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the protocolyooin the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The incident of theyoocheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay Parfenovitch was tooyoowell pleased with them, as it was, and did not want to worry them withyootrifles, moreover, it was nothing but a foolish, drunken quarrel overyoocards. There had been drinking and disorder enough, that night.... So theyootwo hundred roubles remained in the pockets of the Poles.yooyooThen old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached with littleyoosteps, looking very disheveled and depressed. He had, all this time, takenyoorefuge below with Grushenka, sitting dumbly beside her, and “now and thenyoohe’d begin blubbering over her and wiping his eyes with a blue checkyoohandkerchief,” as Mihail Makarovitch described afterwards. So that sheyooherself began trying to pacify and comfort him. The old man at onceyooconfessed that he had done wrong, that he had borrowed “ten roubles in myyoopoverty,” from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready to pay it back.yooTo Nikolay Parfenovitch’s direct question, had he noticed how much moneyyooDmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must have been able to see theyoosum better than any one when he took the note from him, Maximov, in theyoomost positive manner, declared that there was twenty thousand.yooyoo“Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?” inquiredyooNikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.yooyoo“To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged myyoolittle property. She’d only let me look at it from a distance, boasting ofyooit to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow-colored notes. AndyooDmitri Fyodorovitch’s were all rainbow-colored....”yooyooHe was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka’s turn. NikolayyooParfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance mightyoohave on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of admonition to him, but Mityayoobowed his head in silence, giving him to understand “that he would notyoomake a scene.” Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in. She enteredyoowith a stern and gloomy face, that looked almost composed and sat downyooquietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch. She was veryyoopale, she seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in heryoomagnificent black shawl. She was suffering from a slight feverishyoochill—the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night. Heryoograve air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favorableyooimpression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bityoo“fascinated.” He admitted himself, when talking about it afterwards, thatyooonly then had he seen “how handsome the woman was,” for, though he hadyooseen her several times before, he had always looked upon her as somethingyooof a “provincial hetaira.” “She has the manners of the best society,” heyoosaid enthusiastically, gossiping about her in a circle of ladies. But thisyoowas received with positive indignation by the ladies, who immediatelyyoocalled him a “naughty man,” to his great satisfaction.yooyooAs she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya,yoowho looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him at once. After theyoofirst inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her,yoohesitating a little, but preserving the most courteous manner, on whatyooterms she was with the retired lieutenant, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov.yooTo this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied:yooyoo“He was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance during theyoolast month.” To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly andyoowith complete frankness, that, though “at times” she had thought himyooattractive, she had not loved him, but had won his heart as well as hisyooold father’s “in my nasty spite,” that she had seen that Mitya was veryyoojealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every one else; but that had only amusedyooher. She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had simply beenyoolaughing at him. “I had no thoughts for either of them all this lastyoomonth. I was expecting another man who had wronged me. But I think,” sheyoosaid in conclusion, “that there’s no need for you to inquire about that,yoonor for me to answer you, for that’s my own affair.”yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He again dismissedyoothe “romantic” aspect of the case and passed to the serious one, that is,yooto the question of most importance, concerning the three thousand roubles.yooGrushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles hadyoocertainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe, and, though she hadyoonot counted the money herself, she had heard that it was three thousandyoofrom Dmitri Fyodorovitch’s own lips.yooyoo“Did he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you only hearyoohim speak of it to others in your presence?” the prosecutor inquiredyooimmediately.yooyooTo which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before otheryoopeople, and had heard him say so when they were alone.yooyoo“Did he say it to you alone once, or several times?” inquired theyooprosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times.yooyooIppolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence.yooFurther examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that moneyyoohad come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from KaterinayooIvanovna.yooyoo“And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was notyoothree thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half thatyoosum for his own use?”yooyoo“No, I never heard that,” answered Grushenka.yooyooIt was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told heryoothat he hadn’t a farthing.yooyoo“He was always expecting to get some from his father,” said Grushenka inyooconclusion.yooyoo“Did he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,”yooNikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, “that he intended to make an attemptyooon his father’s life?”yooyoo“Ach, he did say so,” sighed Grushenka.yooyoo“Once or several times?”yooyoo“He mentioned it several times, always in anger.”yooyoo“And did you believe he would do it?”yooyoo“No, I never believed it,” she answered firmly. “I had faith in his nobleyooheart.”yooyoo“Gentlemen, allow me,” cried Mitya suddenly, “allow me to say one word toyooAgrafena Alexandrovna, in your presence.”yooyoo“You can speak,” Nikolay Parfenovitch assented.yooyoo“Agrafena Alexandrovna!” Mitya got up from his chair, “have faith in Godyooand in me. I am not guilty of my father’s murder!”yooyooHaving uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair. Grushenkayoostood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon. “Thanks be to Thee,yooO Lord,” she said, in a voice thrilled with emotion, and still standing,yooshe turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added:yooyoo“As he has spoken now, believe it! I know him. He’ll say anything as ayoojoke or from obstinacy, but he’ll never deceive you against hisyooconscience. He’s telling the whole truth, you may believe it.”yooyoo“Thanks, Agrafena Alexandrovna, you’ve given me fresh courage,” Mityayooresponded in a quivering voice.yooyooAs to the money spent the previous day, she declared that she did not knowyoowhat sum it was, but had heard him tell several people that he had threeyoothousand with him. And to the question where he got the money, she saidyoothat he had told her that he had “stolen” it from Katerina Ivanovna, andyoothat she had replied to that that he hadn’t stolen it, and that he mustyoopay the money back next day. On the prosecutor’s asking her emphaticallyyoowhether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what heyoohad spent yesterday, or what he had squandered here a month ago, sheyoodeclared that he meant the money spent a month ago, and that that was howyooshe understood him.yooyooGrushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed heryooimpulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he couldyoobe of any assistance to her, with horses for example, or if she would careyoofor an escort, he ... would be—yooyoo“I thank you sincerely,” said Grushenka, bowing to him, “I’m going withyoothis old gentleman, I am driving him back to town with me, and meanwhile,yooif you’ll allow me, I’ll wait below to hear what you decide about DmitriyooFyodorovitch.”yooyooShe went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful, but only foryooa moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness.yooHis eyes were closing with fatigue. The examination of the witnesses was,yooat last, over. They proceeded to a final revision of the protocol. Mityayoogot up, moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on ayoolarge chest covered with a rug, and instantly fell asleep.yooyooHe had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place and theyootime.yooyooHe was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been stationed longyooago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses,yoothrough snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early in November, and theyoosnow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as soon as it touched theyooearth. And the peasant drove him smartly, he had a fair, long beard. Heyoowas not an old man, somewhere about fifty, and he had on a gray peasant’syoosmock. Not far off was a village, he could see the black huts, and halfyoothe huts were burnt down, there were only the charred beams sticking up.yooAnd as they drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road, ayoolot of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a sort ofyoobrownish color, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman, who lookedyooforty, but might have been only twenty, with a long thin face. And in heryooarms was a little baby crying. And her breasts seemed so dried up thatyoothere was not a drop of milk in them. And the child cried and cried, andyooheld out its little bare arms, with its little fists blue from cold.yooyoo“Why are they crying? Why are they crying?” Mitya asked, as they dashedyoogayly by.yooyoo“It’s the babe,” answered the driver, “the babe weeping.”yooyooAnd Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, “the babe,” and heyooliked the peasant’s calling it a “babe.” There seemed more pity in it.yooyoo“But why is it weeping?” Mitya persisted stupidly, “why are its littleyooarms bare? Why don’t they wrap it up?”yooyoo“The babe’s cold, its little clothes are frozen and don’t warm it.”yooyoo“But why is it? Why?” foolish Mitya still persisted.yooyoo“Why, they’re poor people, burnt out. They’ve no bread. They’re beggingyoobecause they’ve been burnt out.”yooyoo“No, no,” Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. “Tell me why it isyoothose poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor? Why is the babe poor?yooWhy is the steppe barren? Why don’t they hug each other and kiss? Whyyoodon’t they sing songs of joy? Why are they so dark from black misery? Whyyoodon’t they feed the babe?”yooyooAnd he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and senseless,yooyet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it just in that way. Andyoohe felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never known before, wasyoorising in his heart, that he wanted to cry, that he wanted to do somethingyoofor them all, so that the babe should weep no more, so that theyoodark-faced, dried-up mother should not weep, that no one should shed tearsyooagain from that moment, and he wanted to do it at once, at once,yooregardless of all obstacles, with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs.yooyoo“And I’m coming with you. I won’t leave you now for the rest of my life,yooI’m coming with you,” he heard close beside him Grushenka’s tender voice,yoothrilling with emotion. And his heart glowed, and he struggled forwardyootowards the light, and he longed to live, to live, to go on and on,yootowards the new, beckoning light, and to hasten, hasten, now, at once!yooyoo“What! Where?” he exclaimed opening his eyes, and sitting up on the chest,yooas though he had revived from a swoon, smiling brightly. NikolayyooParfenovitch was standing over him, suggesting that he should hear theyooprotocol read aloud and sign it. Mitya guessed that he had been asleep anyoohour or more, but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was suddenlyyoostruck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head, which hadn’tyoobeen there when he had leant back, exhausted, on the chest.yooyoo“Who put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?” he cried, with ayoosort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as though some greatyookindness had been shown him.yooyooHe never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the peasantyoowitnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch’s little secretary, had compassionatelyyoothought to put a pillow under his head; but his whole soul was quiveringyoowith tears. He went to the table and said that he would sign whatever theyyooliked.yooyoo“I’ve had a good dream, gentlemen,” he said in a strange voice, with a newyoolight, as of joy, in his face.yooyooyooyooChapter IX. They Carry Mitya AwayyooyooyooWhen the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch turned solemnly toyoothe prisoner and read him the “Committal,” setting forth, that in such ayooyear, on such a day, in such a place, the investigating lawyer ofyoosuch-and-such a district court, having examined so-and-so (to wit, Mitya)yooaccused of this and of that (all the charges were carefully written out)yooand having considered that the accused, not pleading guilty to the chargesyoomade against him, had brought forward nothing in his defense, while theyoowitnesses, so-and-so, and so-and-so, and the circumstances such-and-suchyootestify against him, acting in accordance with such-and-such articles ofyoothe Statute Book, and so on, has ruled, that, in order to precludeyooso-and-so (Mitya) from all means of evading pursuit and judgment he beyoodetained in such-and-such a prison, which he hereby notifies to theyooaccused and communicates a copy of this same “Committal” to the deputyyooprosecutor, and so on, and so on.yooyooIn brief, Mitya was informed that he was, from that moment, a prisoner,yooand that he would be driven at once to the town, and there shut up in ayoovery unpleasant place. Mitya listened attentively, and only shrugged hisyooshoulders.yooyoo“Well, gentlemen, I don’t blame you. I’m ready.... I understand thatyoothere’s nothing else for you to do.”yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be escorted at onceyooby the rural police officer, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, who happened to be onyoothe spot....yooyoo“Stay,” Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by uncontrollableyoofeeling he pronounced, addressing all in the room:yooyoo“Gentlemen, we’re all cruel, we’re all monsters, we all make men weep, andyoomothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be settled here, now,yooof all I am the lowest reptile! I’ve sworn to amend, and every day I’veyoodone the same filthy things. I understand now that such men as I need ayooblow, a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose, and bind them by ayooforce from without. Never, never should I have risen of myself! But theyoothunderbolt has fallen. I accept the torture of accusation, and my publicyooshame, I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified. Perhaps Iyooshall be purified, gentlemen? But listen, for the last time, I am notyooguilty of my father’s blood. I accept my punishment, not because I killedyoohim, but because I meant to kill him, and perhaps I really might haveyookilled him. Still I mean to fight it out with you. I warn you of that.yooI’ll fight it out with you to the end, and then God will decide. Good-by,yoogentlemen, don’t be vexed with me for having shouted at you during theyooexamination. Oh, I was still such a fool then.... In another minute Iyooshall be a prisoner, but now, for the last time, as a free man, DmitriyooKaramazov offers you his hand. Saying good-by to you, I say it to allyoomen.”yooyooHis voice quivered and he stretched out his hand, but NikolayyooParfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him, with a sudden, almostyoonervous movement, hid his hands behind his back. Mitya instantly noticedyoothis, and started. He let his outstretched hand fall at once.yooyoo“The preliminary inquiry is not yet over,” Nikolay Parfenovitch faltered,yoosomewhat embarrassed. “We will continue it in the town, and I, for myyoopart, of course, am ready to wish you all success ... in your defense....yooAs a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I’ve always been disposed toyooregard you as, so to speak, more unfortunate than guilty. All of us here,yooif I may make bold to speak for all, we are all ready to recognize thatyooyou are, at bottom, a young man of honor, but, alas, one who has beenyoocarried away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree....”yooyooNikolay Parfenovitch’s little figure was positively majestic by the timeyoohe had finished speaking. It struck Mitya that in another minute thisyoo“boy” would take his arm, lead him to another corner, and renew theiryooconversation about “girls.” But many quite irrelevant and inappropriateyoothoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he is being led out toyooexecution.yooyoo“Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see _her_ to say ‘good-by’yoofor the last time?” asked Mitya.yooyoo“Certainly, but considering ... in fact, now it’s impossible except in theyoopresence of—”yooyoo“Oh, well, if it must be so, it must!”yooyooGrushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few words,yooand did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch. Grushenka made a deep bowyooto Mitya.yooyoo“I have told you I am yours, and I will be yours. I will follow you foryooever, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless, thoughyooyou’ve been your own undoing.”yooyooHer lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.yooyoo“Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my love.”yooyooMitya would have said something more, but he broke off and went out. Heyoowas at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on him. At theyoobottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such a dash the dayyoobefore with Andrey’s three horses, two carts stood in readiness. MavrikyyooMavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick-set man with a wrinkled face, was annoyedyooabout something, some sudden irregularity. He was shouting angrily. Heyooasked Mitya to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness.yooyoo“When I stood him drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a differentyooface,” thought Mitya, as he got in. At the gates there was a crowd ofyoopeople, peasants, women and drivers. Trifon Borissovitch came down theyoosteps too. All stared at Mitya.yooyoo“Forgive me at parting, good people!” Mitya shouted suddenly from theyoocart.yooyoo“Forgive us too!” he heard two or three voices.yooyoo“Good-by to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch!”yooyooBut Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round. He was, perhaps, tooyoobusy. He, too, was shouting and fussing about something. It appeared thatyooeverything was not yet ready in the second cart, in which two constablesyoowere to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. The peasant who had been orderedyooto drive the second cart was pulling on his smock, stoutly maintainingyoothat it was not his turn to go, but Akim’s. But Akim was not to be seen.yooThey ran to look for him. The peasant persisted and besought them to wait.yooyoo“You see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. They’ve no shame!”yooexclaimed Trifon Borissovitch. “Akim gave you twenty-five copecks the dayyoobefore yesterday. You’ve drunk it all and now you cry out. I’m simplyyoosurprised at your good-nature, with our low peasants, MavrikyyooMavrikyevitch, that’s all I can say.”yooyoo“But what do we want a second cart for?” Mitya put in. “Let’s start withyoothe one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. I won’t be unruly, I won’t run away fromyooyou, old fellow. What do we want an escort for?”yooyoo“I’ll trouble you, sir, to learn how to speak to me if you’ve never beenyootaught. I’m not ‘old fellow’ to you, and you can keep your advice foryooanother time!” Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out savagely, as though gladyooto vent his wrath.yooyooMitya was reduced to silence. He flushed all over. A moment later he feltyoosuddenly very cold. The rain had ceased, but the dull sky was stillyooovercast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing straight in his face.yooyoo“I’ve taken a chill,” thought Mitya, twitching his shoulders.yooyooAt last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down heavily,yooand, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into the corner. It isyootrue that he was out of humor and greatly disliked the task that had beenyoolaid upon him.yooyoo“Good-by, Trifon Borissovitch!” Mitya shouted again, and felt himself,yoothat he had not called out this time from good-nature, but involuntarily,yoofrom resentment.yooyooBut Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly, with both hands behind his back,yooand staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face, he made noyooreply.yooyoo“Good-by, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, good-by!” he heard all at once the voice ofyooKalganov, who had suddenly darted out. Running up to the cart he held outyoohis hand to Mitya. He had no cap on.yooyooMitya had time to seize and press his hand.yooyoo“Good-by, dear fellow! I shan’t forget your generosity,” he cried warmly.yooyooBut the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began ringing andyooMitya was driven off.yooyooKalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his head, hid his face inyoohis hands, and burst out crying. For a long while he sat like that, cryingyooas though he were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty. Oh, heyoobelieved almost without doubt in Mitya’s guilt.yooyoo“What are these people?

There had been a hard frost, elevenyoodegrees Réaumur, without snow, but a little dry snow had fallen on theyoofrozen ground during the night, and a keen dry wind was lifting andyooblowing it along the dreary streets of our town, especially about theyoomarket-place. It was a dull morning, but the snow had ceased.yooyooNot far from the market-place, close to Plotnikov’s shop, there stood ayoosmall house, very clean both without and within. It belonged to MadameyooKrassotkin, the widow of a former provincial secretary, who had been deadyoofor fourteen years. His widow, still a nice-looking woman of thirty-two,yoowas living in her neat little house on her private means. She lived inyoorespectable seclusion; she was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition.yooShe was about eighteen at the time of her husband’s death; she had beenyoomarried only a year and had just borne him a son. From the day of hisyoodeath she had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of heryooprecious treasure, her boy Kolya. Though she had loved him passionatelyyoothose fourteen years, he had caused her far more suffering than happiness.yooShe had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day, afraidyoohe would fall ill, would catch cold, do something naughty, climb on ayoochair and fall off it, and so on and so on. When Kolya began going toyooschool, the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with himyooso as to help him, and go through his lessons with him. She hastened toyoomake the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives, even made up toyooKolya’s schoolfellows, and fawned upon them in the hope of thus savingyooKolya from being teased, laughed at, or beaten by them. She went so faryoothat the boys actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt himyoowith being a “mother’s darling.”yooyooBut the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy, “tremendouslyyoostrong,” as was rumored in his class, and soon proved to be the fact; heyoowas agile, strong-willed, and of an audacious and enterprising temper. Heyoowas good at lessons, and there was a rumor in the school that he couldyoobeat the teacher, Dardanelov, at arithmetic and universal history. Thoughyoohe looked down upon every one, he was a good comrade and not supercilious.yooHe accepted his schoolfellows’ respect as his due, but was friendly withyoothem. Above all, he knew where to draw the line. He could restrain himselfyooon occasion, and in his relations with the teachers he never oversteppedyoothat last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breachyooof discipline. But he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasionyooas the smallest boy in the school, and not so much for the sake ofyoomischief as for creating a sensation, inventing something, somethingyooeffective and conspicuous. He was extremely vain. He knew how to make evenyoohis mother give way to him; he was almost despotic in his control of her.yooShe gave way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years. The oneyoothought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love for her. Sheyoowas always fancying that Kolya was “unfeeling” to her, and at times,yoodissolving into hysterical tears, she used to reproach him with hisyoocoldness. The boy disliked this, and the more demonstrations of feelingyoowere demanded of him the more he seemed intentionally to avoid them. Yetyooit was not intentional on his part but instinctive—it was his character.yooHis mother was mistaken; he was very fond of her. He only dislikedyoo“sheepish sentimentality,” as he expressed it in his schoolboy language.yooyooThere was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been hisyoofather’s. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read several of them byyoohimself. His mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes atyooseeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book insteadyooof going to play. And in that way Kolya read some things unsuitable foryoohis age.yooyooThough the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his mischief, heyoohad of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious alarm. Ityoois true there was nothing vicious in what he did, but a wild madyoorecklessness.yooyooIt happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the mother and sonyoowent to another district, forty-five miles away, to spend a week with ayoodistant relation, whose husband was an official at the railway stationyoo(the very station, the nearest one to our town, from which a month lateryooIvan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow). There Kolya began byyoocarefully investigating every detail connected with the railways, knowingyoothat he could impress his schoolfellows when he got home with his newlyyooacquired knowledge. But there happened to be some other boys in the placeyoowith whom he soon made friends. Some of them were living at the station,yooothers in the neighborhood; there were six or seven of them, all betweenyootwelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our town. The boys playedyootogether, and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolya’s stay at the station, ayoomad bet was made by the foolish boys. Kolya, who was almost the youngestyooof the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence, wasyoomoved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that heyoowould lie down between the rails at night when the eleven o’clock trainyoowas due, and would lie there without moving while the train rolled overyoohim at full speed. It is true they made a preliminary investigation, fromyoowhich it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the railsyoothat the train could pass over without touching, but to lie there was noyoojoke! Kolya maintained stoutly that he would. At first they laughed atyoohim, called him a little liar, a braggart, but that only egged him on.yooWhat piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their nosesyooat him too superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him as “ayoosmall boy,” not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurableyooinsult.yooyooAnd so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the station,yooso that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving theyoostation. The boys assembled. It was a pitch-dark night without a moon. Atyoothe time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails. The five others who hadyootaken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment, their heartsyoobeating with suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At lastyoothey heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station.yooTwo red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as ityooapproached.yooyoo“Run, run away from the rails,” the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes,yoobreathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted up and flewyoopast. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving. They began pullingyooat him, lifting him up. He suddenly got up and walked away without a word.yooThen he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible toyoofrighten them, but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness, asyoohe confessed long after to his mother. In this way his reputation as “ayoodesperate character,” was established for ever. He returned home to theyoostation as white as a sheet. Next day he had a slight attack of nervousyoofever, but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself. Theyooincident did not become known at once, but when they came back to the townyooit penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of the masters. Butyoothen Kolya’s mother hastened to entreat the masters on her boy’s behalf,yooand in the end Dardanelov, a respected and influential teacher, exertedyoohimself in his favor, and the affair was ignored.yooyooDardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately in loveyoowith Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had once already, about ayooyear previously, ventured, trembling with fear and the delicacy of hisyoosentiments, to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage. But sheyoorefused him resolutely, feeling that to accept him would be an act ofyootreachery to her son, though Dardanelov had, to judge from certainyoomysterious symptoms, reason for believing that he was not an object ofyooaversion to the charming but too chaste and tender-hearted widow. Kolya’syoomad prank seemed to have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded foryoohis intercession by a suggestion of hope. The suggestion, it is true, wasyooa faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacyyoothat it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly happy. He wasyoofond of the boy, though he would have felt it beneath him to try and winyoohim over, and was severe and strict with him in class. Kolya, too, keptyoohim at a respectful distance. He learned his lessons perfectly; he wasyoosecond in his class, was reserved with Dardanelov, and the whole classyoofirmly believed that Kolya was so good at universal history that he couldyoo“beat” even Dardanelov. Kolya did indeed ask him the question, “Whoyoofounded Troy?” to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referringyooto the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the period,yooto the mythical legends. But the question, “Who had founded Troy?” thatyoois, what individuals, he could not answer, and even for some reasonyooregarded the question as idle and frivolous. But the boys remainedyooconvinced that Dardanelov did not know who founded Troy. Kolya had read ofyoothe founders of Troy in Smaragdov, whose history was among the books inyoohis father’s bookcase. In the end all the boys became interested in theyooquestion, who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tellyoohis secret, and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.yooyooAfter the incident on the railway a certain change came over Kolya’syooattitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame Krassotkin) heard ofyooher son’s exploit, she almost went out of her mind with horror. She hadyoosuch terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting with intervals for severalyoodays, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at last, promised on his honor thatyoosuch pranks should never be repeated. He swore on his knees before theyooholy image, and swore by the memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkin’syooinstance, and the “manly” Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six. Andyooall that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other’syooarms sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as “unfeeling” as before, but he hadyoobecome more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful.yooyooSix weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which evenyoobrought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was ayooscrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did not, as ityooturned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in it.yooBut of this later. His mother still fretted and trembled, but the moreyoouneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov. It must beyoonoted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelov’s heartyooand, of course, despised him profoundly for his “feelings”; he had in theyoopast been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother, hintingyoovaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the time of theyoorailway incident his behavior in this respect also was changed; he did notyooallow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak moreyoorespectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the sensitive woman atyooonce appreciated with boundless gratitude. But at the slightest mention ofyooDardanelov by a visitor in Kolya’s presence, she would flush as pink as ayoorose. At such moments Kolya would either stare out of the window scowling,yooor would investigate the state of his boots, or would shout angrily foryoo“Perezvon,” the big, shaggy, mangy dog, which he had picked up a monthyoobefore, brought home, and kept for some reason secretly indoors, notyooshowing him to any of his schoolfellows. He bullied him frightfully,yooteaching him all sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog howled for himyoowhenever he was absent at school, and when he came in, whined withyoodelight, rushed about as if he were crazy, begged, lay down on the groundyoopretending to be dead, and so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he hadyootaught him, not at the word of command, but simply from the zeal of hisyooexcited and grateful heart.yooyooI have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the boyyoostabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the sonyooof Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending his father when theyooschoolboys jeered at him, shouting the nickname “wisp of tow.”yooyooyooyooChapter II. ChildrenyooyooyooAnd so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November, Kolya Krassotkinyoowas sitting at home. It was Sunday and there was no school. It had justyoostruck eleven, and he particularly wanted to go out “on very urgentyoobusiness,” but he was left alone in charge of the house, for it soyoohappened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden andyoosingular event. Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms, separated fromyoothe rest of the house by a passage, to a doctor’s wife with her two smallyoochildren. This lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a greatyoofriend of hers. Her husband, the doctor, had taken his departure twelveyoomonths before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and for theyoolast six months she had not heard a word from him. Had it not been for heryoofriendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was some consolation to theyooforsaken lady, she would certainly have completely dissolved away inyootears. And now, to add to her misfortunes, Katerina, her only servant, wasyoosuddenly moved the evening before to announce, to her mistress’syooamazement, that she proposed to bring a child into the world beforeyoomorning. It seemed almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticedyoothe probability of it before. The astounded doctor’s wife decided to moveyooKaterina while there was still time to an establishment in the town keptyooby a midwife for such emergencies. As she set great store by her servant,yooshe promptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her.yooBy the morning all Madame Krassotkin’s friendly sympathy and energy wereyoocalled upon to render assistance and appeal to some one for help in theyoocase.yooyooSo both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins’ servant,yooAgafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus left for a time toyooprotect and look after “the kids,” that is, the son and daughter of theyoodoctor’s wife, who were left alone. Kolya was not afraid of taking care ofyoothe house, besides he had Perezvon, who had been told to lie flat, withoutyoomoving, under the bench in the hall. Every time Kolya, walking to and froyoothrough the rooms, came into the hall, the dog shook his head and gave twoyooloud and insinuating taps on the floor with his tail, but alas! theyoowhistle did not sound to release him. Kolya looked sternly at the lucklessyoodog, who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one thing thatyootroubled Kolya was “the kids.” He looked, of course, with the utmost scornyooon Katerina’s unexpected adventure, but he was very fond of the bereavedyoo“kiddies,” and had already taken them a picture-book. Nastya, the elder, ayoogirl of eight, could read, and Kostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fondyooof being read to by her. Krassotkin could, of course, have provided moreyoodiverting entertainment for them. He could have made them stand side byyooside and played soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over theyoohouse. He had done so more than once before and was not above doing it, soyoomuch so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horsesyoowith the little lodgers at home, prancing with his head on one side like ayootrace-horse. But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust, pointing outyoothat to play horses with boys of one’s own age, boys of thirteen, wouldyoocertainly be disgraceful “at this date,” but that he did it for the sakeyooof “the kids” because he liked them, and no one had a right to call him toyooaccount for his feelings. The two “kids” adored him.yooyooBut on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very importantyoobusiness of his own before him, something almost mysterious. Meanwhileyootime was passing and Agafya, with whom he could have left the children,yoowould not come back from market. He had several times already crossed theyoopassage, opened the door of the lodgers’ room and looked anxiously at “theyookids” who were sitting over the book, as he had bidden them. Every time heyooopened the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would doyoosomething delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and did not goyooin.yooyooAt last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all, that ifyoothat “damned” Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go outyoowithout waiting for her, making “the kids” promise, of course, to be braveyoowhen he was away, not to be naughty, not to cry from fright. With thisyooidea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar,yooslung his satchel round his shoulder, and, regardless of his mother’syooconstantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on goloshes inyoosuch cold weather, he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hallyooand went out with only his boots on. Perezvon, seeing him in his outdooryooclothes, began tapping nervously, yet vigorously, on the floor with hisyootail. Twitching all over, he even uttered a plaintive whine. But Kolya,yooseeing his dog’s passionate excitement, decided that it was a breach ofyoodiscipline, kept him for another minute under the bench, and only when heyoohad opened the door into the passage, whistled for him. The dog leapt upyoolike a mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously.yooyooKolya opened the door to peep at “the kids.” They were both sitting asyoobefore at the table, not reading but warmly disputing about something. Theyoochildren often argued together about various exciting problems of life,yooand Nastya, being the elder, always got the best of it. If Kostya did notyooagree with her, he almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and hisyooverdict was regarded as infallible by both of them. This time the “kids’”yoodiscussion rather interested Krassotkin, and he stood still in the passageyooto listen. The children saw he was listening and that made them disputeyoowith even greater energy.yooyoo“I shall never, never believe,” Nastya prattled, “that the old women findyoobabies among the cabbages in the kitchen-garden. It’s winter now and thereyooare no cabbages, and so the old woman couldn’t have taken Katerina ayoodaughter.”yooyooKolya whistled to himself.yooyoo“Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to those who areyoomarried.”yooyooKostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.yooyoo“Nastya, how silly you are!” he said at last, firmly and calmly. “How canyooKaterina have a baby when she isn’t married?”yooyooNastya was exasperated.yooyoo“You know nothing about it,” she snapped irritably. “Perhaps she has ayoohusband, only he is in prison, so now she’s got a baby.”yooyoo“But is her husband in prison?” the matter-of-fact Kostya inquiredyoogravely.yooyoo“Or, I tell you what,” Nastya interrupted impulsively, completelyyoorejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. “She hasn’t a husband, youyooare right there, but she wants to be married, and so she’s been thinkingyooof getting married, and thinking and thinking of it till now she’s got it,yoothat is, not a husband but a baby.”yooyoo“Well, perhaps so,” Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. “But you didn’tyoosay so before. So how could I tell?”yooyoo“Come, kiddies,” said Kolya, stepping into the room. “You’re terribleyoopeople, I see.”yooyoo“And Perezvon with you!” grinned Kostya, and began snapping his fingersyooand calling Perezvon.yooyoo“I am in a difficulty, kids,” Krassotkin began solemnly, “and you mustyoohelp me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has not turned up tillyoonow, that’s certain. I must go out. Will you let me go?”yooyooThe children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces showedyoosigns of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected ofyoothem.yooyoo“You won’t be naughty while I am gone? You won’t climb on the cupboard andyoobreak your legs? You won’t be frightened alone and cry?”yooyooA look of profound despondency came into the children’s faces.yooyoo“And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper cannon whichyoocan be fired with real gunpowder.”yooyooThe children’s faces instantly brightened. “Show us the cannon,” saidyooKostya, beaming all over.yooyooKrassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little bronzeyoocannon stood it on the table.yooyoo“Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it’s on wheels.” He rolled the toyyooon along the table. “And it can be fired off, too. It can be loaded withyooshot and fired off.”yooyoo“And it could kill any one?”yooyoo“It can kill any one; you’ve only got to aim at anybody,” and Krassotkinyooexplained where the powder had to be put, where the shot should be rolledyooin, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and told them that it kickedyoowhen it was fired.yooyooThe children listened with intense interest. What particularly struckyootheir imagination was that the cannon kicked.yooyoo“And have you got any powder?” Nastya inquired.yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Show us the powder, too,” she drawled with a smile of entreaty.yooyooKrassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flaskyoocontaining a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in a screw ofyoopaper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palmyooof his hand.yooyoo“One has to be careful there’s no fire about, or it would blow up and killyoous all,” Krassotkin warned them sensationally.yooyooThe children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that onlyyoointensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.yooyoo“And does the shot burn?” he inquired.yooyoo“No, it doesn’t.”yooyoo“Give me a little shot,” he asked in an imploring voice.yooyoo“I’ll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don’t show it to youryoomother till I come back, or she’ll be sure to think it’s gunpowder, andyoowill die of fright and give you a thrashing.”yooyoo“Mother never does whip us,” Nastya observed at once.yooyoo“I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don’t you ever deceiveyooyour mother except just this once, until I come back. And so, kiddies, canyooI go out? You won’t be frightened and cry when I’m gone?”yooyoo“We sha—all cry,” drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already.yooyoo“We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,” Nastya chimed in with timidyoohaste.yooyoo“Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years! There’s noyoohelp for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I don’t know howyoolong. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!”yooyoo“Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!” Kostya begged.yooyoo“There’s no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. _Ici_,yooPerezvon.” And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed all hisyootricks.yooyooHe was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort ofyoolilac-gray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear wasyootorn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind legs, lay on hisyooback with his paws in the air, rigid as though he were dead. While thisyoolast performance was going on, the door opened and Agafya, MadameyooKrassotkin’s servant, a stout woman of forty, marked with small-pox,yooappeared in the doorway. She had come back from market and had a bag fullyooof provisions in her hand. Holding up the bag of provisions in her leftyoohand she stood still to watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so anxiousyoofor her return, he did not cut short the performance, and after keepingyooPerezvon dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him. The dogyoojumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty.yooyoo“Only think, a dog!” Agafya observed sententiously.yooyoo“Why are you late, female?” asked Krassotkin sternly.yooyoo“Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.”yooyoo“Brat?”yooyoo“Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I’m late; if I’m late, you may be sureyooI have good reason,” muttered Agafya, busying herself about the stove,yoowithout a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice. She seemed quiteyoopleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master.yooyoo“Listen, you frivolous young woman,” Krassotkin began, getting up from theyoosofa, “can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and somethingyooelse besides, that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence?yooI am going out.”yooyoo“And what am I going to swear for?” laughed Agafya. “I shall look afteryoothem without that.”yooyoo“No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan’t go.”yooyoo“Well, don’t then. What does it matter to me? It’s cold out; stay atyoohome.”yooyoo“Kids,” Kolya turned to the children, “this woman will stay with you tillyooI come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to have been backyoolong ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You’ll give them something,yooAgafya, won’t you?”yooyoo“That I can do.”yooyoo“Good-by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you, granny,” he addedyoogravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, “I hope you’ll spare theiryootender years and not tell them any of your old woman’s nonsense aboutyooKaterina. _Ici_, Perezvon!”yooyoo“Get along with you!” retorted Agafya, really angry this time. “Ridiculousyooboy! You want a whipping for saying such things, that’s what you want!”yooyooyooyooChapter III. The SchoolboyyooyooyooBut Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he went out at theyoogate he looked round him, shrugged up his shoulders, and saying “It isyoofreezing,” went straight along the street and turned off to the rightyootowards the market-place. When he reached the last house but one beforeyoothe market-place he stopped at the gate, pulled a whistle out of hisyoopocket, and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal. He hadyoonot to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven,yoowearing a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to meet him. Thisyoowas Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class (two classes below KolyayooKrassotkin), son of a well-to-do official. Apparently he was forbidden byyoohis parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known to be ayoodesperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly.yooHe was—if the reader has not forgotten—one of the group of boys who twoyoomonths before had thrown stones at Ilusha. He was the one who told AlyoshayooKaramazov about Ilusha.yooyoo“I’ve been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,” said Smurovyoostolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.yooyoo“I am late,” answered Krassotkin. “I was detained by circumstances. Youyoowon’t be thrashed for coming with me?”yooyoo“Come, I say, I’m never thrashed! And you’ve got Perezvon with you?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“You’re taking him, too?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!”yooyoo“That’s impossible. Zhutchka’s non-existent. Zhutchka is lost in the mistsyooof obscurity.”yooyoo“Ah! couldn’t we do this?” Smurov suddenly stood still. “You see Ilushayoosays that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky-looking dog like Perezvon.yooCouldn’t you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he might believe you?”yooyoo“Boy, shun a lie, that’s one thing; even with a good object—that’syooanother. Above all, I hope you’ve not told them anything about my coming.”yooyoo“Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you won’t comfort him withyooPerezvon,” said Smurov, with a sigh. “You know his father, the captain,yoo‘the wisp of tow,’ told us that he was going to bring him a real mastiffyoopup, with a black nose, to-day. He thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but Iyoodoubt it.”yooyoo“And how is Ilusha?”yooyoo“Ah, he is bad, very bad! I believe he’s in consumption: he is quiteyooconscious, but his breathing! His breathing’s gone wrong. The other day heyooasked to have his boots on to be led round the room. He tried to walk, butyoohe couldn’t stand. ‘Ah, I told you before, father,’ he said, ‘that thoseyooboots were no good. I could never walk properly in them.’ He fancied ityoowas his boots that made him stagger, but it was simply weakness, really.yooHe won’t live another week. Herzenstube is looking after him. Now they areyoorich again—they’ve got heaps of money.”yooyoo“They are rogues.”yooyoo“Who are rogues?”yooyoo“Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of course,yooindividually. I don’t believe in medicine. It’s a useless institution. Iyoomean to go into all that. But what’s that sentimentality you’ve got upyoothere? The whole class seems to be there every day.”yooyoo“Not the whole class: it’s only ten of our fellows who go to see him everyyooday. There’s nothing in that.”yooyoo“What I don’t understand in all this is the part that Alexey Karamazov isyootaking in it. His brother’s going to be tried to-morrow or next day foryoosuch a crime, and yet he has so much time to spend on sentimentality withyooboys.”yooyoo“There’s no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now to make ityooup with Ilusha.”yooyoo“Make it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow no one toyooanalyze my actions.”yooyoo“And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that you areyoocoming. Why was it, why was it you wouldn’t come all this time?” Smurovyoocried with sudden warmth.yooyoo“My dear boy, that’s my business, not yours. I am going of myself becauseyooI choose to, but you’ve all been hauled there by Alexey Karamazov—there’syooa difference, you know. And how do you know? I may not be going to make ityooup at all. It’s a stupid expression.”yooyoo“It’s not Karamazov at all; it’s not his doing. Our fellows began goingyoothere of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov at first. Andyoothere’s been nothing of that sort—no silliness. First one went, and thenyooanother. His father was awfully pleased to see us. You know he will simplyyoogo out of his mind if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha’s dying. And heyooseems so glad we’ve made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, thatyoowas all. He just asks and says no more. His father will go out of his mindyooor hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a veryyoodecent man. We made a mistake then. It’s all the fault of that murdereryoowho beat him then.”yooyoo“Karamazov’s a riddle to me all the same. I might have made hisyooacquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some cases.yooBesides, I have a theory about him which I must work out and verify.”yooyooKolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent. Smurov, ofyoocourse, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on ayoolevel with him. Now he was tremendously interested at Kolya’s saying thatyoohe was “going of himself” to see Ilusha. He felt that there must be someyoomystery in Kolya’s suddenly taking it into his head to go to him that day.yooThey crossed the market-place, in which at that hour were many loadedyoowagons from the country and a great number of live fowls. The market womenyoowere selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths. TheseyooSunday markets were naïvely called “fairs” in the town, and there wereyoomany such fairs in the year.yooyooPerezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one side,yoothen the other. When he met other dogs they zealously smelt each otheryooover according to the rules of canine etiquette.yooyoo“I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,” said Kolya suddenly.yoo“Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet? It seemsyooto be a law of their nature.”yooyoo“Yes; it’s a funny habit.”yooyoo“No, it’s not funny; you are wrong there. There’s nothing funny in nature,yoohowever funny it may seem to man with his prejudices. If dogs could reasonyooand criticize us they’d be sure to find just as much that would be funnyyooto them, if not far more, in the social relations of men, theiryoomasters—far more, indeed. I repeat that, because I am convinced that thereyoois far more foolishness among us. That’s Rakitin’s idea—a remarkable idea.yooI am a Socialist, Smurov.”yooyoo“And what is a Socialist?” asked Smurov.yooyoo“That’s when all are equal and all have property in common, there are noyoomarriages, and every one has any religion and laws he likes best, and allyoothe rest of it. You are not old enough to understand that yet. It’s cold,yoothough.”yooyoo“Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer just now.”yooyoo“Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we don’t feel soyoocold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we doyoonow, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden frost of twelveyoodegrees, especially when there is not much snow. It’s because people areyoonot used to it. Everything is habit with men, everything even in theiryoosocial and political relations. Habit is the great motive-power. What ayoofunny-looking peasant!”yooyooKolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance in a longyoosheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping together hisyoohands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them. His long fairyoobeard was all white with frost.yooyoo“That peasant’s beard’s frozen,” Kolya cried in a loud provocative voiceyooas he passed him.yooyoo“Lots of people’s beards are frozen,” the peasant replied, calmly andyoosententiously.yooyoo“Don’t provoke him,” observed Smurov.yooyoo“It’s all right; he won’t be cross; he’s a nice fellow. Good-by, Matvey.”yooyoo“Good-by.”yooyoo“Is your name Matvey?”yooyoo“Yes. Didn’t you know?”yooyoo“No, I didn’t. It was a guess.”yooyoo“You don’t say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“You get whipped, I expect?”yooyoo“Nothing to speak of—sometimes.”yooyoo“Does it hurt?”yooyoo“Well, yes, it does.”yooyoo“Ech, what a life!” The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of hisyooheart.yooyoo“Good-by, Matvey.”yooyoo“Good-by. You are a nice chap, that you are.”yooyooThe boys went on.yooyoo“That was a nice peasant,” Kolya observed to Smurov. “I like talking toyoothe peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.”yooyoo“Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?” asked Smurov.yooyoo“I had to say that to please him.”yooyoo“How do you mean?”yooyoo“You know, Smurov, I don’t like being asked the same thing twice. I likeyoopeople to understand at the first word. Some things can’t be explained.yooAccording to a peasant’s notions, schoolboys are whipped, and must beyoowhipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped? And if I wereyooto tell him we are not, he’d be disappointed. But you don’t understandyoothat. One has to know how to talk to the peasants.”yooyoo“Only don’t tease them, please, or you’ll get into another scrape as youyoodid about that goose.”yooyoo“So you’re afraid?”yooyoo“Don’t laugh, Kolya. Of course I’m afraid. My father would be awfullyyoocross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.”yooyoo“Don’t be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo, Natasha!” heyooshouted to a market woman in one of the booths.yooyoo“Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,” the middle-aged marketyoowoman shouted at him.yooyoo“I am so glad it’s Marya. Good-by!”yooyoo“Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!”yooyoo“I’m in a hurry. I can’t stay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.” Kolyayoowaved his hand at her, as though she had attacked him and not he her.yooyoo“I’ve nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you impudent youngyoomonkey. I didn’t say anything,” bawled Marya. “You want a whipping, that’syoowhat you want, you saucy jackanapes!”yooyooThere was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her.yooSuddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops closeyooby. He was a young man, not a native of the town, with dark, curly hairyooand a long, pale face, marked with smallpox. He wore a long blue coat andyooa peaked cap, and looked like a merchant’s clerk. He was in a state ofyoostupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya.yooyoo“I know you!” he cried angrily, “I know you!”yooyooKolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have had a row withyoothe man. But he had been in so many rows in the street that he couldyoohardly remember them all.yooyoo“Do you?” he asked sarcastically.yooyoo“I know you! I know you!” the man repeated idiotically.yooyoo“So much the better for you. Well, it’s time I was going. Good-by!”yooyoo“You are at your saucy pranks again?” cried the man. “You are at youryoosaucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!”yooyoo“It’s not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks again,” saidyooKolya, standing still and scanning him.yooyoo“Not my business?”yooyoo“No; it’s not your business.”yooyoo“Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?”yooyoo“It’s Trifon Nikititch’s business, not yours.”yooyoo“What Trifon Nikititch?” asked the youth, staring with loutish amazementyooat Kolya, but still as angry as ever.yooyooKolya scanned him gravely.yooyoo“Have you been to the Church of the Ascension?” he suddenly asked him,yoowith stern emphasis.yooyoo“What Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven’t,” said the young man,yoosomewhat taken aback.yooyoo“Do you know Sabaneyev?” Kolya went on even more emphatically and evenyoomore severely.yooyoo“What Sabaneyev? No, I don’t know him.”yooyoo“Well then you can go to the devil,” said Kolya, cutting short theyooconversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on hisyooway as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did notyooeven know Sabaneyev.yooyoo“Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?” the young man recovered from his momentaryyoostupefaction and was as excited as before. “What did he say?” He turned toyoothe market women with a silly stare.yooyooThe women laughed.yooyoo“You can never tell what he’s after,” said one of them.yooyoo“What Sabaneyev is it he’s talking about?” the young man repeated, stillyoofurious and brandishing his right arm.yooyoo“It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, that’s who it mustyoobe,” one of the women suggested.yooyooThe young man stared at her wildly.yooyoo“For the Kuzmitchovs?” repeated another woman. “But his name wasn’tyooTrifon. His name’s Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch,yooso it can’t be the same.”yooyoo“His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, it’s Tchizhov,” put in suddenlyyooa third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening gravely. “AlexeyyooIvanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.”yooyoo“Not a doubt about it, it’s Tchizhov,” a fourth woman emphaticallyyooconfirmed the statement.yooyooThe bewildered youth gazed from one to another.yooyoo“But what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?” he criedyooalmost in desperation. “ ‘Do you know Sabaneyev?’ says he. And who theyoodevil’s to know who is Sabaneyev?”yooyoo“You’re a senseless fellow. I tell you it’s not Sabaneyev, but Tchizhov,yooAlexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, that’s who it is!” one of the women shouted atyoohim impressively.yooyoo“What Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.”yooyoo“That tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer.”yooyoo“And what’s your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?”yooyoo“How can I tell what he’s to do with you?” put in another. “You ought toyooknow yourself what you want with him, if you make such a clamor about him.yooHe spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you stupid. Don’t you really knowyoohim?”yooyoo“Know whom?”yooyoo“Tchizhov.”yooyoo“The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I’ll give him a hiding, that Iyoowill. He was laughing at me!”yooyoo“Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one. You are ayoofool, that’s what you are!”yooyoo“Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman. I’ll giveyoothe boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing at me!”yooyooThe woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off, marching alongyoowith a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him, looking round at theyooshouting group far behind. He too was in high spirits, though he was stillyooafraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya’s company.yooyoo“What Sabaneyev did you mean?” he asked Kolya, foreseeing what his answeryoowould be.yooyoo“How do I know? Now there’ll be a hubbub among them all day. I like toyoostir up fools in every class of society. There’s another blockhead, thatyoopeasant there. You know, they say ‘there’s no one stupider than a stupidyooFrenchman,’ but a stupid Russian shows it in his face just as much. Can’tyooyou see it all over his face that he is a fool, that peasant, eh?”yooyoo“Let him alone, Kolya. Let’s go on.”yooyoo“Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning, peasant!”yooyooA sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled beard,yoowho was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy. He seemed notyooquite sober.yooyoo“Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,” he said deliberately inyooreply.yooyoo“And if I am?” laughed Kolya.yooyoo“Well, a joke’s a joke. Laugh away. I don’t mind. There’s no harm in ayoojoke.”yooyoo“I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.”yooyoo“Well, God forgive you!”yooyoo“Do you forgive me, too?”yooyoo“I quite forgive you. Go along.”yooyoo“I say, you seem a clever peasant.”yooyoo“Cleverer than you,” the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the sameyoogravity.yooyoo“I doubt it,” said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.yooyoo“It’s true, though.”yooyoo“Perhaps it is.”yooyoo“It is, brother.”yooyoo“Good-by, peasant!”yooyoo“Good-by!”yooyoo“There are all sorts of peasants,” Kolya observed to Smurov after a briefyoosilence. “How could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am always ready toyoorecognize intelligence in the peasantry.”yooyooIn the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. The boys madeyoohaste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov’s lodging, ayooconsiderable distance, quickly and almost in silence. Twenty paces fromyoothe house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on ahead and ask Karamazovyooto come out to him.yooyoo“One must sniff round a bit first,” he observed to Smurov.yooyoo“Why ask him to come out?” Smurov protested. “You go in; they will beyooawfully glad to see you. What’s the sense of making friends in the frostyooout here?”yooyoo“I know why I want to see him out here in the frost,” Kolya cut him shortyooin the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with “small boys,” and Smurovyooran to do his bidding.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. The Lost DogyooyooyooKolya leaned against the fence with an air of dignity, waiting for Alyoshayooto appear. Yes, he had long wanted to meet him. He had heard a great dealyooabout him from the boys, but hitherto he had always maintained anyooappearance of disdainful indifference when he was mentioned, and he hadyooeven “criticized” what he heard about Alyosha. But secretly he had a greatyoolonging to make his acquaintance; there was something sympathetic andyooattractive in all he was told about Alyosha. So the present moment wasyooimportant: to begin with, he had to show himself at his best, to show hisyooindependence, “Or he’ll think of me as thirteen and take me for a boy,yoolike the rest of them. And what are these boys to him? I shall ask himyoowhen I get to know him. It’s a pity I am so short, though. Tuzikov isyooyounger than I am, yet he is half a head taller. But I have a clever face.yooI am not good-looking. I know I’m hideous, but I’ve a clever face. Iyoomustn’t talk too freely; if I fall into his arms all at once, he mayyoothink—Tfoo! how horrible if he should think—!”yooyooSuch were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he was doing his utmost toyooassume the most independent air. What distressed him most was his being soyooshort; he did not mind so much his “hideous” face, as being so short. Onyoothe wall in a corner at home he had the year before made a pencil-mark toyooshow his height, and every two months since he anxiously measured himselfyooagainst it to see how much he had gained. But alas! he grew very slowly,yooand this sometimes reduced him almost to despair. His face was in realityyooby no means “hideous”; on the contrary, it was rather attractive, with ayoofair, pale skin, freckled. His small, lively gray eyes had a fearlessyoolook, and often glowed with feeling. He had rather high cheekbones; small,yoovery red, but not very thick, lips; his nose was small and unmistakablyyooturned up. “I’ve a regular pug nose, a regular pug nose,” Kolya used toyoomutter to himself when he looked in the looking-glass, and he always leftyooit with indignation. “But perhaps I haven’t got a clever face?” heyoosometimes thought, doubtful even of that. But it must not be supposed thatyoohis mind was preoccupied with his face and his height. On the contrary,yoohowever bitter the moments before the looking-glass were to him, heyooquickly forgot them, and forgot them for a long time, “abandoning himselfyooentirely to ideas and to real life,” as he formulated it to himself.yooyooAlyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before he reached him,yooKolya could see that he looked delighted. “Can he be so glad to see me?”yooKolya wondered, feeling pleased. We may note here, in passing, thatyooAlyosha’s appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw himyoolast. He had abandoned his cassock and was wearing now a well-cut coat, ayoosoft, round hat, and his hair had been cropped short. All this was veryyoobecoming to him, and he looked quite handsome. His charming face alwaysyoohad a good-humored expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity inyoohis good-humor. To Kolya’s surprise, Alyosha came out to him just as heyoowas, without an overcoat. He had evidently come in haste. He held out hisyoohand to Kolya at once.yooyoo“Here you are at last! How anxious we’ve been to see you!”yooyoo“There were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am glad toyoomake your acquaintance. I’ve long been hoping for an opportunity, and haveyooheard a great deal about you,” Kolya muttered, a little breathless.yooyoo“We should have met anyway. I’ve heard a great deal about you, too; butyooyou’ve been a long time coming here.”yooyoo“Tell me, how are things going?”yooyoo“Ilusha is very ill. He is certainly dying.”yooyoo“How awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,” criedyooKolya warmly.yooyoo“Ilusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his sleep, inyoodelirium, you know. One can see that you used to be very, very dear to himyoo... before the incident ... with the knife.... Then there’s anotheryooreason.... Tell me, is that your dog?”yooyoo“Yes, Perezvon.”yooyoo“Not Zhutchka?” Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity. “Is sheyoolost for ever?”yooyoo“I know you would all like it to be Zhutchka. I’ve heard all about it.”yooKolya smiled mysteriously. “Listen, Karamazov, I’ll tell you all about it.yooThat’s what I came for; that’s what I asked you to come out here for, toyooexplain the whole episode to you before we go in,” he began withyooanimation. “You see, Karamazov, Ilusha came into the preparatory classyoolast spring. Well, you know what our preparatory class is—a lot of smallyooboys. They began teasing Ilusha at once. I am two classes higher up, and,yooof course, I only look on at them from a distance. I saw the boy was weakyooand small, but he wouldn’t give in to them; he fought with them. I saw heyoowas proud, and his eyes were full of fire. I like children like that. Andyoothey teased him all the more. The worst of it was he was horribly dressedyooat the time, his breeches were too small for him, and there were holes inyoohis boots. They worried him about it; they jeered at him. That I can’tyoostand. I stood up for him at once, and gave it to them hot. I beat them,yoobut they adore me, do you know, Karamazov?” Kolya boasted impulsively;yoo“but I am always fond of children. I’ve two chickens in my hands at homeyoonow—that’s what detained me to-day. So they left off beating Ilusha and Iyootook him under my protection. I saw the boy was proud. I tell you that,yoothe boy was proud; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me: heyoodid my slightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God, tried to copyyoome. In the intervals between the classes he used to run to me at once, andyooI’d go about with him. On Sundays, too. They always laugh when an olderyooboy makes friends with a younger one like that; but that’s a prejudice. Ifyooit’s my fancy, that’s enough. I am teaching him, developing him. Whyyooshouldn’t I develop him if I like him? Here you, Karamazov, have taken upyoowith all these nestlings. I see you want to influence the youngeryoogeneration—to develop them, to be of use to them, and I assure you thisyootrait in your character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more thanyooanything. Let us get to the point, though. I noticed that there was a sortyooof softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and you know I have ayoopositive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality, and I have had it from ayoobaby. There were contradictions in him, too: he was proud, but he wasyooslavishly devoted to me, and yet all at once his eyes would flash and he’dyoorefuse to agree with me; he’d argue, fly into a rage. I used sometimes toyoopropound certain ideas; I could see that it was not so much that heyoodisagreed with the ideas, but that he was simply rebelling against me,yoobecause I was cool in responding to his endearments. And so, in order toyootrain him properly, the tenderer he was, the colder I became. I did it onyoopurpose: that was my idea. My object was to form his character, to lickyoohim into shape, to make a man of him ... and besides ... no doubt, youyoounderstand me at a word. Suddenly I noticed for three days in successionyoohe was downcast and dejected, not because of my coldness, but foryoosomething else, something more important. I wondered what the tragedy was.yooI have pumped him and found out that he had somehow got to knowyooSmerdyakov, who was footman to your late father—it was before his death,yooof course—and he taught the little fool a silly trick—that is, a brutal,yoonasty trick. He told him to take a piece of bread, to stick a pin in it,yooand throw it to one of those hungry dogs who snap up anything withoutyoobiting it, and then to watch and see what would happen. So they prepared ayoopiece of bread like that and threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog there’syoobeen such a fuss about. The people of the house it belonged to never fedyooit at all, though it barked all day. (Do you like that stupid barking,yooKaramazov? I can’t stand it.) So it rushed at the bread, swallowed it, andyoobegan to squeal; it turned round and round and ran away, squealing as ityooran out of sight. That was Ilusha’s own account of it. He confessed it toyoome, and cried bitterly. He hugged me, shaking all over. He kept onyoorepeating ‘He ran away squealing’: the sight of that haunted him. He wasyootormented by remorse, I could see that. I took it seriously. I determinedyooto give him a lesson for other things as well. So I must confess I wasn’tyooquite straightforward, and pretended to be more indignant perhaps than Iyoowas. ‘You’ve done a nasty thing,’ I said, ‘you are a scoundrel. I won’tyootell of it, of course, but I shall have nothing more to do with you for ayootime. I’ll think it over and let you know through Smurov’—that’s the boyyoowho’s just come with me; he’s always ready to do anything for me—‘whetheryooI will have anything to do with you in the future or whether I give you upyoofor good as a scoundrel.’ He was tremendously upset. I must own I felt I’dyoogone too far as I spoke, but there was no help for it. I did what Iyoothought best at the time. A day or two after, I sent Smurov to tell himyoothat I would not speak to him again. That’s what we call it when twoyooschoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one another.yooSecretly I only meant to send him to Coventry for a few days and then, ifyooI saw signs of repentance, to hold out my hand to him again. That was myyoointention. But what do you think happened? He heard Smurov’s message, hisyooeyes flashed. ‘Tell Krassotkin from me,’ he cried, ‘that I will throwyoobread with pins to all the dogs—all—all of them!’ ‘So he’s going in for ayoolittle temper. We must smoke it out of him.’ And I began to treat him withyoocontempt; whenever I met him I turned away or smiled sarcastically. Andyoojust then that affair with his father happened. You remember? You mustyoorealize that he was fearfully worked up by what had happened already. Theyooboys, seeing I’d given him up, set on him and taunted him, shouting, ‘Wispyooof tow, wisp of tow!’ And he had soon regular skirmishes with them, whichyooI am very sorry for. They seem to have given him one very bad beating. Oneyooday he flew at them all as they were coming out of school. I stood a fewyooyards off, looking on. And, I swear, I don’t remember that I laughed; ityoowas quite the other way, I felt awfully sorry for him, in another minute Iyoowould have run up to take his part. But he suddenly met my eyes. I don’tyooknow what he fancied; but he pulled out a penknife, rushed at me, andyoostruck at my thigh, here in my right leg. I didn’t move. I don’t mindyooowning I am plucky sometimes, Karamazov. I simply looked at himyoocontemptuously, as though to say, ‘This is how you repay all my kindness!yooDo it again, if you like, I’m at your service.’ But he didn’t stab meyooagain; he broke down, he was frightened at what he had done, he threw awayyoothe knife, burst out crying, and ran away. I did not sneak on him, ofyoocourse, and I made them all keep quiet, so it shouldn’t come to the earsyooof the masters. I didn’t even tell my mother till it had healed up. Andyoothe wound was a mere scratch. And then I heard that the same day he’d beenyoothrowing stones and had bitten your finger—but you understand now what ayoostate he was in! Well, it can’t be helped: it was stupid of me not to comeyooand forgive him—that is, to make it up with him—when he was taken ill. Iyooam sorry for it now. But I had a special reason. So now I’ve told you allyooabout it ... but I’m afraid it was stupid of me.”yooyoo“Oh, what a pity,” exclaimed Alyosha, with feeling, “that I didn’t knowyoobefore what terms you were on with him, or I’d have come to you long agoyooto beg you to go to him with me. Would you believe it, when he wasyoofeverish he talked about you in delirium. I didn’t know how much you wereyooto him! And you’ve really not succeeded in finding that dog? His fatheryooand the boys have been hunting all over the town for it. Would you believeyooit, since he’s been ill, I’ve three times heard him repeat with tears,yoo‘It’s because I killed Zhutchka, father, that I am ill now. God isyoopunishing me for it.’ He can’t get that idea out of his head. And if theyoodog were found and proved to be alive, one might almost fancy the joyyoowould cure him. We have all rested our hopes on you.”yooyoo“Tell me, what made you hope that I should be the one to find him?” Kolyayooasked, with great curiosity. “Why did you reckon on me rather than any oneyooelse?”yooyoo“There was a report that you were looking for the dog, and that you wouldyoobring it when you’d found it. Smurov said something of the sort. We’ve allyoobeen trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog is alive, that it’s been seen.yooThe boys brought him a live hare; he just looked at it, with a faintyoosmile, and asked them to set it free in the fields. And so we did. Hisyoofather has just this moment come back, bringing him a mastiff pup, hopingyooto comfort him with that; but I think it only makes it worse.”yooyoo“Tell me, Karamazov, what sort of man is the father? I know him, but whatyoodo you make of him—a mountebank, a buffoon?”yooyoo“Oh, no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow crushed.yooBuffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against those to whom theyyoodaren’t speak the truth, from having been for years humiliated andyoointimidated by them. Believe me, Krassotkin, that sort of buffoonery isyoosometimes tragic in the extreme. His whole life now is centered in Ilusha,yooand if Ilusha dies, he will either go mad with grief or kill himself. Iyoofeel almost certain of that when I look at him now.”yooyoo“I understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human nature,” Kolyayooadded, with feeling.yooyoo“And as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka you wereyoobringing.”yooyoo“Wait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this isyooPerezvon. I’ll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha moreyoothan the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will know something in ayoominute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!” Kolya cried suddenly. “You’veyoono overcoat on in this bitter cold. You see what an egoist I am. Oh, weyooare all egoists, Karamazov!”yooyoo“Don’t trouble; it is cold, but I don’t often catch cold. Let us go in,yoothough, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are called Kolya,yoobut what else?”yooyoo“Nikolay—Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in officialyoodocuments, ‘Krassotkin son.’ ” Kolya laughed for some reason, but addedyoosuddenly, “Of course I hate my name Nikolay.”yooyoo“Why so?”yooyoo“It’s so trivial, so ordinary.”yooyoo“You are thirteen?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“No, fourteen—that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a fortnight. I’llyooconfess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to you, since it’s our firstyoomeeting, so that you may understand my character at once. I hate beingyooasked my age, more than that ... and in fact ... there’s a libelous storyyoogoing about me, that last week I played robbers with the preparatory boys.yooIt’s a fact that I did play with them, but it’s a perfect libel to say Iyoodid it for my own amusement. I have reasons for believing that you’veyooheard the story; but I wasn’t playing for my own amusement, it was for theyoosake of the children, because they couldn’t think of anything to do byyoothemselves. But they’ve always got some silly tale. This is an awful townyoofor gossip, I can tell you.”yooyoo“But what if you had been playing for your own amusement, what’s theyooharm?”yooyoo“Come, I say, for my own amusement! You don’t play horses, do you?”yooyoo“But you must look at it like this,” said Alyosha, smiling. “Grown-upyoopeople go to the theater and there the adventures of all sorts of heroesyooare represented—sometimes there are robbers and battles, too—and isn’tyoothat just the same thing, in a different form, of course? And youngyoopeople’s games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also art inyooits first stage. You know, they spring from the growing artistic instinctsyooof the young. And sometimes these games are much better than performancesyooin the theater, the only difference is that people go there to look at theyooactors, while in these games the young people are the actors themselves.yooBut that’s only natural.”yooyoo“You think so? Is that your idea?” Kolya looked at him intently. “Oh, youyooknow, that’s rather an interesting view. When I go home, I’ll think ityooover. I’ll admit I thought I might learn something from you. I’ve come toyoolearn of you, Karamazov,” Kolya concluded, in a voice full of spontaneousyoofeeling.yooyoo“And I of you,” said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand.yooyooKolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most was that heyootreated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if heyoowere “quite grown up.”yooyoo“I’ll show you something directly, Karamazov; it’s a theatricalyooperformance, too,” he said, laughing nervously. “That’s why I’ve come.”yooyoo“Let us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All the boysyooleave their coats in there, because the room is small and hot.”yooyoo“Oh, I’m only coming in for a minute. I’ll keep on my overcoat. Perezvonyoowill stay here in the passage and be dead. _Ici_, Perezvon, lie down andyoobe dead! You see how he’s dead. I’ll go in first and explore, then I’llyoowhistle to him when I think fit, and you’ll see, he’ll dash in like mad.yooOnly Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment. I’ll arrangeyooit all and you’ll see something.”yooyooyooyooChapter V. By Ilusha’s BedsideyooyooyooThe room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov isyooalready familiar to the reader. It was close and crowded at that momentyoowith a number of visitors. Several boys were sitting with Ilusha, andyoothough all of them, like Smurov, were prepared to deny that it was Alyoshayoowho had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha, it was really theyoofact. All the art he had used had been to take them, one by one, toyooIlusha, without “sheepish sentimentality,” appearing to do so casually andyoowithout design. It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his suffering. Heyoowas greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and sympathyyooshown him by these boys, who had been his enemies. Krassotkin was the onlyyooone missing and his absence was a heavy load on Ilusha’s heart. Perhapsyoothe bitterest of all his bitter memories was his stabbing Krassotkin, whoyoohad been his one friend and protector. Clever little Smurov, who was theyoofirst to make it up with Ilusha, thought it was so. But when Smurov hintedyooto Krassotkin that Alyosha wanted to come and see him about something, theyoolatter cut him short, bidding Smurov tell “Karamazov” at once that he knewyoobest what to do, that he wanted no one’s advice, and that, if he went toyoosee Ilusha, he would choose his own time for he had “his own reasons.”yooyooThat was a fortnight before this Sunday. That was why Alyosha had not beenyooto see him, as he had meant to. But though he waited, he sent Smurov toyoohim twice again. Both times Krassotkin met him with a curt, impatientyoorefusal, sending Alyosha a message not to bother him any more, that if heyoocame himself, he, Krassotkin, would not go to Ilusha at all. Up to theyoovery last day, Smurov did not know that Kolya meant to go to Ilusha thatyoomorning, and only the evening before, as he parted from Smurov, Kolyayooabruptly told him to wait at home for him next morning, for he would goyoowith him to the Snegiryovs’, but warned him on no account to say he wasyoocoming, as he wanted to drop in casually. Smurov obeyed. Smurov’s fancyyoothat Kolya would bring back the lost dog was based on the words Kolya hadyoodropped that “they must be asses not to find the dog, if it was alive.”yooWhen Smurov, waiting for an opportunity, timidly hinted at his guess aboutyoothe dog, Krassotkin flew into a violent rage. “I’m not such an ass as toyoogo hunting about the town for other people’s dogs when I’ve got a dog ofyoomy own! And how can you imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing ayoopin? Sheepish sentimentality, that’s what it is!”yooyooFor the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his little bed under the ikonsyooin the corner. He had not been to school since the day he met Alyosha andyoobit his finger. He was taken ill the same day, though for a monthyooafterwards he was sometimes able to get up and walk about the room andyoopassage. But latterly he had become so weak that he could not move withoutyoohelp from his father. His father was terribly concerned about him. He evenyoogave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror that his boy would die.yooAnd often, especially after leading him round the room on his arm andyooputting him back to bed, he would run to a dark corner in the passage and,yooleaning his head against the wall, he would break into paroxysms ofyooviolent weeping, stifling his sobs that they might not be heard by Ilusha.yooyooReturning to the room, he would usually begin doing something to amuse andyoocomfort his precious boy; he would tell him stories, funny anecdotes, oryoowould mimic comic people he had happened to meet, even imitate the howlsyooand cries of animals. But Ilusha could not bear to see his father foolingyooand playing the buffoon. Though the boy tried not to show how he dislikedyooit, he saw with an aching heart that his father was an object of contempt,yooand he was continually haunted by the memory of the “wisp of tow” and thatyoo“terrible day.”yooyooNina, Ilusha’s gentle, crippled sister, did not like her father’syoobuffoonery either (Varvara had been gone for some time past to Petersburgyooto study at the university). But the half-imbecile mother was greatlyyoodiverted and laughed heartily when her husband began capering about oryooperforming something. It was the only way she could be amused; all theyoorest of the time she was grumbling and complaining that now every one hadyooforgotten her, that no one treated her with respect, that she wasyooslighted, and so on. But during the last few days she had completelyyoochanged. She began looking constantly at Ilusha’s bed in the corner andyooseemed lost in thought. She was more silent, quieter, and, if she cried,yooshe cried quietly so as not to be heard. The captain noticed the change inyooher with mournful perplexity. The boys’ visits at first only angered her,yoobut later on their merry shouts and stories began to divert her, and atyoolast she liked them so much that, if the boys had given up coming, sheyoowould have felt dreary without them. When the children told some story oryooplayed a game, she laughed and clapped her hands. She called some of themyooto her and kissed them. She was particularly fond of Smurov.yooyooAs for the captain, the presence in his room of the children, who came toyoocheer up Ilusha, filled his heart from the first with ecstatic joy. Heyooeven hoped that Ilusha would now get over his depression, and that thatyoowould hasten his recovery. In spite of his alarm about Ilusha, he had not,yootill lately, felt one minute’s doubt of his boy’s ultimate recovery.yooyooHe met his little visitors with homage, waited upon them hand and foot; heyoowas ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his back,yoobut Ilusha did not like the game and it was given up. He began buyingyoolittle things for them, gingerbread and nuts, gave them tea and cut themyoosandwiches. It must be noted that all this time he had plenty of money. Heyoohad taken the two hundred roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyoshayoohad predicted he would. And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna, learning moreyooabout their circumstances and Ilusha’s illness, visited them herself, madeyoothe acquaintance of the family, and succeeded in fascinating theyoohalf-imbecile mother. Since then she had been lavish in helping them, andyoothe captain, terror-stricken at the thought that his boy might be dying,yooforgot his pride and humbly accepted her assistance.yooyooAll this time Doctor Herzenstube, who was called in by Katerina Ivanovna,yoocame punctually every other day, but little was gained by his visits andyoohe dosed the invalid mercilessly. But on that Sunday morning a new doctoryoowas expected, who had come from Moscow, where he had a great reputation.yooKaterina Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at great expense, notyooexpressly for Ilusha, but for another object of which more will be said inyooits place hereafter. But, as he had come, she had asked him to see Ilushayooas well, and the captain had been told to expect him. He hadn’t theyooslightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was coming, though he had long wishedyoofor a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting.yooyooAt the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room, theyoocaptain and all the boys were round Ilusha’s bed, looking at a tinyyoomastiff pup, which had only been born the day before, though the captainyoohad bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha, who was stillyoofretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka. Ilusha, who had heardyoothree days before that he was to be presented with a puppy, not anyooordinary puppy, but a pedigree mastiff (a very important point, ofyoocourse), tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased.yooBut his father and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy onlyyooserved to recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he hadyookilled. The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he, smiling sadly,yoostroked it with his thin, pale, wasted hand. Clearly he liked the puppy,yoobut ... it wasn’t Zhutchka; if he could have had Zhutchka and the puppy,yootoo, then he would have been completely happy.yooyoo“Krassotkin!” cried one of the boys suddenly. He was the first to see himyoocome in.yooyooKrassotkin’s entrance made a general sensation; the boys moved away andyoostood on each side of the bed, so that he could get a full view of Ilusha.yooThe captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.yooyoo“Please come in ... you are welcome!” he said hurriedly. “Ilusha, Mr.yooKrassotkin has come to see you!”yooyooBut Krassotkin, shaking hands with him hurriedly, instantly showed hisyoocomplete knowledge of the manners of good society. He turned first to theyoocaptain’s wife sitting in her arm-chair, who was very ill-humored at theyoomoment, and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and Ilusha’s bedyooand did not let her see the new puppy. With the greatest courtesy he madeyooher a bow, scraping his foot, and turning to Nina, he made her, as theyooonly other lady present, a similar bow. This polite behavior made anyooextremely favorable impression on the deranged lady.yooyoo“There, you can see at once he is a young man that has been well broughtyooup,” she commented aloud, throwing up her hands; “but as for our otheryoovisitors they come in one on the top of another.”yooyoo“How do you mean, mamma, one on the top of another, how is that?” mutteredyoothe captain affectionately, though a little anxious on her account.yooyoo“That’s how they ride in. They get on each other’s shoulders in theyoopassage and prance in like that on a respectable family. Strange sort ofyoovisitors!”yooyoo“But who’s come in like that, mamma?”yooyoo“Why, that boy came in riding on that one’s back and this one on thatyooone’s.”yooyooKolya was already by Ilusha’s bedside. The sick boy turned visibly paler.yooHe raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya. Kolya had notyooseen his little friend for two months, and he was overwhelmed at the sightyooof him. He had never imagined that he would see such a wasted, yellowyooface, such enormous, feverishly glowing eyes and such thin little hands.yooHe saw, with grieved surprise, Ilusha’s rapid, hard breathing and dryyoolips. He stepped close to him, held out his hand, and almost overwhelmed,yoohe said:yooyoo“Well, old man ... how are you?” But his voice failed him, he couldn’tyooachieve an appearance of ease; his face suddenly twitched and the cornersyooof his mouth quivered. Ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile, still unableyooto utter a word. Something moved Kolya to raise his hand and pass it overyooIlusha’s hair.yooyoo“Never mind!” he murmured softly to him to cheer him up, or perhaps notyooknowing why he said it. For a minute they were silent again.yooyoo“Hallo, so you’ve got a new puppy?” Kolya said suddenly, in a most callousyoovoice.yooyoo“Ye—es,” answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for breath.yooyoo“A black nose, that means he’ll be fierce, a good house-dog,” Kolyayooobserved gravely and stolidly, as if the only thing he cared about was theyoopuppy and its black nose. But in reality he still had to do his utmost toyoocontrol his feelings not to burst out crying like a child, and do what heyoowould he could not control it. “When it grows up, you’ll have to keep ityooon the chain, I’m sure.”yooyoo“He’ll be a huge dog!” cried one of the boys.yooyoo“Of course he will,” “a mastiff,” “large,” “like this,” “as big as ayoocalf,” shouted several voices.yooyoo“As big as a calf, as a real calf,” chimed in the captain. “I got one likeyoothat on purpose, one of the fiercest breed, and his parents are huge andyoovery fierce, they stand as high as this from the floor.... Sit down here,yooon Ilusha’s bed, or here on the bench. You are welcome, we’ve been hopingyooto see you a long time.... You were so kind as to come with AlexeyyooFyodorovitch?”yooyooKrassotkin sat on the edge of the bed, at Ilusha’s feet. Though he hadyooperhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation on his way,yoonow he completely lost the thread of it.yooyoo“No ... I came with Perezvon. I’ve got a dog now, called Perezvon. AyooSlavonic name. He’s out there ... if I whistle, he’ll run in. I’ve broughtyooa dog, too,” he said, addressing Ilusha all at once. “Do you rememberyooZhutchka, old man?” he suddenly fired the question at him.yooyooIlusha’s little face quivered. He looked with an agonized expression atyooKolya. Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and signed to Kolya not toyoospeak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would not notice.yooyoo“Where ... is Zhutchka?” Ilusha asked in a broken voice.yooyoo“Oh, well, my boy, your Zhutchka’s lost and done for!”yooyooIlusha did not speak, but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya.yooAlyosha, catching Kolya’s eye, signed to him vigorously again, but heyooturned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed.yooyoo“It must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died after a mealyoolike that,” Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he seemed a littleyoobreathless. “But I’ve got a dog, Perezvon ... A Slavonic name.... I’veyoobrought him to show you.”yooyoo“I don’t want him!” said Ilusha suddenly.yooyoo“No, no, you really must see him ... it will amuse you. I brought him onyoopurpose.... He’s the same sort of shaggy dog.... You allow me to call inyoomy dog, madam?” He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov, with inexplicableyooexcitement in his manner.yooyoo“I don’t want him, I don’t want him!” cried Ilusha, with a mournful breakyooin his voice. There was a reproachful light in his eyes.yooyoo“You’d better,” the captain started up from the chest by the wall on whichyoohe had just sat down, “you’d better ... another time,” he muttered, butyooKolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly shouted to Smurov, “Open theyoodoor,” and as soon as it was open, he blew his whistle. Perezvon dashedyooheadlong into the room.yooyoo“Jump, Perezvon, beg! Beg!” shouted Kolya, jumping up, and the dog stoodyooerect on its hind-legs by Ilusha’s bedside. What followed was a surpriseyooto every one: Ilusha started, lurched violently forward, bent overyooPerezvon and gazed at him, faint with suspense.yooyoo“It’s ... Zhutchka!” he cried suddenly, in a voice breaking with joy andyoosuffering.yooyoo“And who did you think it was?” Krassotkin shouted with all his might, inyooa ringing, happy voice, and bending down he seized the dog and lifted himyooup to Ilusha.yooyoo“Look, old man, you see, blind of one eye and the left ear is torn, justyoothe marks you described to me. It was by that I found him. I found himyoodirectly. He did not belong to any one!” he explained, turning quickly toyoothe captain, to his wife, to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha. “He used toyoolive in the Fedotovs’ back-yard. Though he made his home there, they didyoonot feed him. He was a stray dog that had run away from the village ... Iyoofound him.... You see, old man, he couldn’t have swallowed what you gaveyoohim. If he had, he must have died, he must have! So he must have spat ityooout, since he is alive. You did not see him do it. But the pin pricked hisyootongue, that is why he squealed. He ran away squealing and you thoughtyoohe’d swallowed it. He might well squeal, because the skin of dogs’ mouthsyoois so tender ... tenderer than in men, much tenderer!” Kolya criedyooimpetuously, his face glowing and radiant with delight. Ilusha could notyoospeak. White as a sheet, he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya, with his greatyooeyes almost starting out of his head. And if Krassotkin, who had noyoosuspicion of it, had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such ayoomoment might have on the sick child’s health, nothing would have inducedyoohim to play such a trick on him. But Alyosha was perhaps the only personyooin the room who realized it. As for the captain he behaved like a smallyoochild.yooyoo“Zhutchka! It’s Zhutchka!” he cried in a blissful voice, “Ilusha, this isyooZhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, this is Zhutchka!” He was almost weeping.yooyoo“And I never guessed!” cried Smurov regretfully. “Bravo, Krassotkin! Iyoosaid he’d find the dog and here he’s found him.”yooyoo“Here he’s found him!” another boy repeated gleefully.yooyoo“Krassotkin’s a brick!” cried a third voice.yooyoo“He’s a brick, he’s a brick!” cried the other boys, and they beganyooclapping.yooyoo“Wait, wait,” Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all. “I’llyootell you how it happened, that’s the whole point. I found him, I took himyoohome and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at home and did not showyoohim to any one till to-day. Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight,yoobut I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess. Andyoomeanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks. You should only see allyoothe things he can do! I trained him so as to bring you a well-trained dog,yooin good condition, old man, so as to be able to say to you, ‘See, old man,yoowhat a fine dog your Zhutchka is now!’ Haven’t you a bit of meat? He’llyooshow you a trick that will make you die with laughing. A piece of meat,yoohaven’t you got any?”yooyooThe captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their cookingyoowas done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate haste, shouted toyooPerezvon, “Dead!” And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his backyoowith its four paws in the air. The boys laughed. Ilusha looked on with theyoosame suffering smile, but the person most delighted with the dog’syooperformance was “mamma.” She laughed at the dog and began snapping heryoofingers and calling it, “Perezvon, Perezvon!”yooyoo“Nothing will make him get up, nothing!” Kolya cried triumphantly, proudyooof his success. “He won’t move for all the shouting in the world, but if Iyoocall to him, he’ll jump up in a minute. Ici, Perezvon!” The dog leapt upyooand bounded about, whining with delight. The captain ran back with a pieceyooof cooked beef.yooyoo“Is it hot?” Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business-like air, takingyoothe meat. “Dogs don’t like hot things. No, it’s all right. Look,yooeverybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren’t you looking? He doesyoonot look at him, now I’ve brought him.”yooyooThe new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his noseyooout and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose. The lucklessyoodog had to stand without moving, with the meat on his nose, as long as hisyoomaster chose to keep him, without a movement, perhaps for half an hour.yooBut he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment.yooyoo“Paid for!” cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the dog’syoonose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm andyoosurprise.yooyoo“Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train theyoodog?” exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of reproach in hisyoovoice.yooyoo“Simply for that!” answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. “I wanted toyooshow him in all his glory.”yooyoo“Perezvon! Perezvon,” called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin fingersyooand beckoning to the dog.yooyoo“What is it? Let him jump up on the bed! _Ici_, Perezvon!” Kolya slappedyoothe bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy threw both arms roundyoohis head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek. Ilusha crept close toyoohim, stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog’s shaggyyoocoat.yooyoo“Dear, dear!” kept exclaiming the captain. Kolya sat down again on theyooedge of the bed.yooyoo“Ilusha, I can show you another trick. I’ve brought you a little cannon.yooYou remember, I told you about it before and you said how much you’d likeyooto see it. Well, here, I’ve brought it to you.”yooyooAnd Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon. Heyoohurried, because he was happy himself. Another time he would have waitedyootill the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off, now he hurried onyooregardless of all consideration. “You are all happy now,” he felt, “soyoohere’s something to make you happier!” He was perfectly enchanted himself.yooyoo“I’ve been coveting this thing for a long while; it’s for you, old man,yooit’s for you. It belonged to Morozov, it was no use to him, he had it fromyoohis brother. I swopped a book from father’s book-case for it, _A Kinsmanyooof Mahomet or Salutary Folly_, a scandalous book published in Moscow ayoohundred years ago, before they had any censorship. And Morozov has a tasteyoofor such things. He was grateful to me, too....”yooyooKolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it.yooIlusha raised himself, and, with his right arm still round the dog, heyoogazed enchanted at the toy. The sensation was even greater when Kolyayooannounced that he had gunpowder too, and that it could be fired off atyooonce “if it won’t alarm the ladies.” “Mamma” immediately asked to look atyoothe toy closer and her request was granted. She was much pleased with theyoolittle bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap.yooShe readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired, without any ideayooof what she had been asked. Kolya showed the powder and the shot. Theyoocaptain, as a military man, undertook to load it, putting in a minuteyooquantity of powder. He asked that the shot might be put off till anotheryootime. The cannon was put on the floor, aiming towards an empty part of theyooroom, three grains of powder were thrust into the touch-hole and a matchyoowas put to it. A magnificent explosion followed. Mamma was startled, butyooat once laughed with delight. The boys gazed in speechless triumph. Butyoothe captain, looking at Ilusha, was more enchanted than any of them. Kolyayoopicked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha, together withyoothe powder and the shot.yooyoo“I got it for you, for you! I’ve been keeping it for you a long time,” heyoorepeated once more in his delight.yooyoo“Oh, give it to me! No, give me the cannon!” mamma began begging like ayoolittle child. Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it.yooKolya was disconcerted. The captain fidgeted uneasily.yooyoo“Mamma, mamma,” he ran to her, “the cannon’s yours, of course, but letyooIlusha have it, because it’s a present to him, but it’s just as good asyooyours. Ilusha will always let you play with it; it shall belong to both ofyooyou, both of you.”yooyoo“No, I don’t want it to belong to both of us, I want it to be mineyooaltogether, not Ilusha’s,” persisted mamma, on the point of tears.yooyoo“Take it, mother, here, keep it!” Ilusha cried. “Krassotkin, may I give ityooto my mother?” he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face, as thoughyoohe were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to some oneyooelse.yooyoo“Of course you may,” Krassotkin assented heartily, and, taking the cannonyoofrom Ilusha, he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow. She was soyootouched that she cried.yooyoo“Ilusha, darling, he’s the one who loves his mamma!” she said tenderly,yooand at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again.yooyoo“Mamma, let me kiss your hand.” The captain darted up to her at once andyoodid so.yooyoo“And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy,” said theyoograteful lady, pointing to Krassotkin.yooyoo“And I’ll bring you as much powder as you like, Ilusha. We make the powderyooourselves now. Borovikov found out how it’s made—twenty-four parts ofyoosaltpeter, ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal. It’s all poundedyootogether, mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammyyoosieve—that’s how it’s done.”yooyoo“Smurov told me about your powder, only father says it’s not realyoogunpowder,” responded Ilusha.yooyoo“Not real?” Kolya flushed. “It burns. I don’t know, of course.”yooyoo“No, I didn’t mean that,” put in the captain with a guilty face. “I onlyyoosaid that real powder is not made like that, but that’s nothing, it can beyoomade so.”yooyoo“I don’t know, you know best. We lighted some in a pomatum pot, it burnedyoosplendidly, it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash. But that was onlyyoothe paste, and if you rub it through ... but of course you know best, Iyoodon’t know.... And Bulkin’s father thrashed him on account of our powder,yoodid you hear?” he turned to Ilusha.yooyoo“Yes,” answered Ilusha. He listened to Kolya with immense interest andyooenjoyment.yooyoo“We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under hisyoobed. His father saw it. He said it might explode, and thrashed him on theyoospot. He was going to make a complaint against me to the masters. He isyoonot allowed to go about with me now, no one is allowed to go about with meyoonow. Smurov is not allowed to either, I’ve got a bad name with every one.yooThey say I’m a ‘desperate character,’ ” Kolya smiled scornfully. “It allyoobegan from what happened on the railway.”yooyoo“Ah, we’ve heard of that exploit of yours, too,” cried the captain. “Howyoocould you lie still on the line? Is it possible you weren’t the leastyooafraid, lying there under the train? Weren’t you frightened?”yooyooThe captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya.yooyoo“N—not particularly,” answered Kolya carelessly. “What’s blasted myyooreputation more than anything here was that cursed goose,” he said,yooturning again to Ilusha. But though he assumed an unconcerned air as heyootalked, he still could not control himself and was continually missing theyoonote he tried to keep up.yooyoo“Ah! I heard about the goose!” Ilusha laughed, beaming all over. “Theyyootold me, but I didn’t understand. Did they really take you to the court?”yooyoo“The most stupid, trivial affair, they made a mountain of a molehill asyoothey always do,” Kolya began carelessly. “I was walking through theyoomarket-place here one day, just when they’d driven in the geese. I stoppedyooand looked at them. All at once a fellow, who is an errand-boy atyooPlotnikov’s now, looked at me and said, ‘What are you looking at the geeseyoofor?’ I looked at him; he was a stupid, moon-faced fellow of twenty. I amyooalways on the side of the peasantry, you know. I like talking to theyoopeasants.... We’ve dropped behind the peasants—that’s an axiom. I believeyooyou are laughing, Karamazov?”yooyoo“No, Heaven forbid, I am listening,” said Alyosha with a most good-naturedyooair, and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured.yooyoo“My theory, Karamazov, is clear and simple,” he hurried on again, lookingyoopleased. “I believe in the people and am always glad to give them theiryoodue, but I am not for spoiling them, that is a _sine qua non_ ... But Iyoowas telling you about the goose. So I turned to the fool and answered, ‘Iyooam wondering what the goose thinks about.’ He looked at me quite stupidly,yoo‘And what does the goose think about?’ he asked. ‘Do you see that cartyoofull of oats?’ I said. ‘The oats are dropping out of the sack, and theyoogoose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up—do youyoosee?’ ‘I see that quite well,’ he said. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘if that cart wereyooto move on a little, would it break the goose’s neck or not?’ ‘It’d beyoosure to break it,’ and he grinned all over his face, highly delighted.yoo‘Come on, then,’ said I, ‘let’s try.’ ‘Let’s,’ he said. And it did notyootake us long to arrange: he stood at the bridle without being noticed, andyooI stood on one side to direct the goose. And the owner wasn’t looking, heyoowas talking to some one, so I had nothing to do, the goose thrust its headyooin after the oats of itself, under the cart, just under the wheel. Iyoowinked at the lad, he tugged at the bridle, and crack. The goose’s neckyoowas broken in half. And, as luck would have it, all the peasants saw us atyoothat moment and they kicked up a shindy at once. ‘You did that onyoopurpose!’ ‘No, not on purpose.’ ‘Yes, you did, on purpose!’ Well, theyyooshouted, ‘Take him to the justice of the peace!’ They took me, too. ‘Youyoowere there, too,’ they said, ‘you helped, you’re known all over theyoomarket!’ And, for some reason, I really am known all over the market,”yooKolya added conceitedly. “We all went off to the justice’s, they broughtyoothe goose, too. The fellow was crying in a great funk, simply blubberingyoolike a woman. And the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any numberyooof geese like that. Well, of course, there were witnesses. The justice ofyoothe peace settled it in a minute, that the farmer was to be paid a roubleyoofor the goose, and the fellow to have the goose. And he was warned not toyooplay such pranks again. And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman. ‘Ityoowasn’t me,’ he said, ‘it was he egged me on,’ and he pointed to me. Iyooanswered with the utmost composure that I hadn’t egged him on, that Iyoosimply stated the general proposition, had spoken hypothetically. Theyoojustice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself at once for havingyoosmiled. ‘I’ll complain to your masters of you, so that for the future youyoomayn’t waste your time on such general propositions, instead of sitting atyooyour books and learning your lessons.’ He didn’t complain to the masters,yoothat was a joke, but the matter was noised abroad and came to the ears ofyoothe masters. Their ears are long, you know! The classical master,yooKolbasnikov, was particularly shocked about it, but Dardanelov got me offyooagain. But Kolbasnikov is savage with every one now like a green ass. Didyooyou know, Ilusha, he is just married, got a dowry of a thousand roubles,yooand his bride’s a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree.yooThe third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it:yooyooyoo    Astounding news has reached the class,yoo    Kolbasnikov has been an ass.yooyooyooAnd so on, awfully funny, I’ll bring it to you later on. I say nothingyooagainst Dardanelov, he is a learned man, there’s no doubt about it. Iyoorespect men like that and it’s not because he stood up for me.”yooyoo“But you took him down about the founders of Troy!” Smurov put inyoosuddenly, unmistakably proud of Krassotkin at such a moment. He wasyooparticularly pleased with the story of the goose.yooyoo“Did you really take him down?” the captain inquired, in a flattering way.yoo“On the question who founded Troy? We heard of it, Ilusha told me about ityooat the time.”yooyoo“He knows everything, father, he knows more than any of us!” put inyooIlusha; “he only pretends to be like that, but really he is top in everyyoosubject....”yooyooIlusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.yooyoo“Oh, that’s all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter. I consider this anyoounimportant question,” said Kolya with haughty humility. He had by nowyoocompletely recovered his dignity, though he was still a little uneasy. Heyoofelt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked about the goose,yoofor instance, with too little reserve, while Alyosha had looked seriousyooand had not said a word all the time. And the vain boy began by degrees toyoohave a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him, andyoothought he was showing off before him. If he dared to think anything likeyoothat Kolya would—yooyoo“I regard the question as quite a trivial one,” he rapped out again,yooproudly.yooyoo“And I know who founded Troy,” a boy, who had not spoken before, saidyoosuddenly, to the surprise of every one. He was silent and seemed to beyooshy. He was a pretty boy of about eleven, called Kartashov. He was sittingyoonear the door. Kolya looked at him with dignified amazement.yooyooThe fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had become a secretyoofor the whole school, a secret which could only be discovered by readingyooSmaragdov, and no one had Smaragdov but Kolya. One day, when Kolya’s backyoowas turned, Kartashov hastily opened Smaragdov, which lay among Kolya’syoobooks, and immediately lighted on the passage relating to the foundationyooof Troy. This was a good time ago, but he felt uneasy and could not bringyoohimself to announce publicly that he too knew who had founded Troy, afraidyooof what might happen and of Krassotkin’s somehow putting him to shame overyooit. But now he couldn’t resist saying it. For weeks he had been longingyooto.yooyoo“Well, who did found it?” asked Kolya, turning to him with haughtyyoosuperciliousness. He saw from his face that he really did know and at onceyoomade up his mind how to take it. There was, so to speak, a discordant noteyooin the general harmony.yooyoo“Troy was founded by Teucer, Dardanus, Ilius and Tros,” the boy rapped outyooat once, and in the same instant he blushed, blushed so, that it wasyoopainful to look at him. But the boys stared at him, stared at him for ayoowhole minute, and then all the staring eyes turned at once and wereyoofastened upon Kolya, who was still scanning the audacious boy withyoodisdainful composure.yooyoo“In what sense did they found it?” he deigned to comment at last. “Andyoowhat is meant by founding a city or a state? What do they do? Did they goyooand each lay a brick, do you suppose?”yooyooThere was laughter. The offending boy turned from pink to crimson. He wasyoosilent and on the point of tears. Kolya held him so for a minute.yooyoo“Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of ayoonationality, you must first understand what you mean by it,” he admonishedyoohim in stern, incisive tones. “But I attach no consequence to these oldyoowives’ tales and I don’t think much of universal history in general,” heyooadded carelessly, addressing the company generally.yooyoo“Universal history?” the captain inquired, looking almost scared.yooyoo“Yes, universal history! It’s the study of the successive follies ofyoomankind and nothing more. The only subjects I respect are mathematics andyoonatural science,” said Kolya. He was showing off and he stole a glance atyooAlyosha; his was the only opinion he was afraid of there. But Alyosha wasyoostill silent and still serious as before. If Alyosha had said a word ityoowould have stopped him, but Alyosha was silent and “it might be theyoosilence of contempt,” and that finally irritated Kolya.yooyoo“The classical languages, too ... they are simply madness, nothing more.yooYou seem to disagree with me again, Karamazov?”yooyoo“I don’t agree,” said Alyosha, with a faint smile.yooyoo“The study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a policeyoomeasure, that’s simply why it has been introduced into our schools.” Byyoodegrees Kolya began to get breathless again. “Latin and Greek wereyoointroduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect.yooIt was dull before, so what could they do to make things duller? It wasyoosenseless enough before, so what could they do to make it more senseless?yooSo they thought of Greek and Latin. That’s my opinion, I hope I shallyoonever change it,” Kolya finished abruptly. His cheeks were flushed.yooyoo“That’s true,” assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of conviction.yooHe had listened attentively.yooyoo“And yet he is first in Latin himself,” cried one of the group of boysyoosuddenly.yooyoo“Yes, father, he says that and yet he is first in Latin,” echoed Ilusha.yooyoo“What of it?” Kolya thought fit to defend himself, though the praise wasyoovery sweet to him. “I am fagging away at Latin because I have to, becauseyooI promised my mother to pass my examination, and I think that whatever youyoodo, it’s worth doing it well. But in my soul I have a profound contemptyoofor the classics and all that fraud.... You don’t agree, Karamazov?”yooyoo“Why ‘fraud’?” Alyosha smiled again.yooyoo“Well, all the classical authors have been translated into all languages,yooso it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin,yoobut solely as a police measure, to stupefy the intelligence. So what canyooone call it but a fraud?”yooyoo“Why, who taught you all this?” cried Alyosha, surprised at last.yooyoo“In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without beingyootaught. Besides, what I said just now about the classics being translatedyooour teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class.”yooyoo“The doctor has come!” cried Nina, who had been silent till then.yooyooA carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate. The captain,yoowho had been expecting the doctor all the morning, rushed headlong out toyoomeet him. “Mamma” pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air.yooAlyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight. Nina,yoofrom her invalid chair, anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy. Theyooboys hurriedly took leave. Some of them promised to come again in theyooevening. Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed.yooyoo“I won’t go away, I won’t go away,” Kolya said hastily to Ilusha. “I’llyoowait in the passage and come back when the doctor’s gone, I’ll come backyoowith Perezvon.”yooyooBut by now the doctor had entered, an important-looking person with long,yoodark whiskers and a shiny, shaven chin, wearing a bearskin coat. As heyoocrossed the threshold he stopped, taken aback; he probably fancied he hadyoocome to the wrong place. “How is this? Where am I?” he muttered, notyooremoving his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap. The crowd, the poverty ofyoothe room, the washing hanging on a line in the corner, puzzled him. Theyoocaptain, bent double, was bowing low before him.yooyoo“It’s here, sir, here, sir,” he muttered cringingly; “it’s here, you’veyoocome right, you were coming to us...”yooyoo“Sne-gi-ryov?” the doctor said loudly and pompously. “Mr. Snegiryov—isyoothat you?”yooyoo“That’s me, sir!”yooyoo“Ah!”yooyooThe doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threwyoooff his coat, displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his neck. Theyoocaptain caught the fur coat in the air, and the doctor took off his cap.yooyoo“Where is the patient?” he asked emphatically.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. Precocityyooyooyoo“What do you think the doctor will say to him?” Kolya asked quickly. “Whatyooa repulsive mug, though, hasn’t he? I can’t endure medicine!”yooyoo“Ilusha is dying. I think that’s certain,” answered Alyosha, mournfully.yooyoo“They are rogues! Medicine’s a fraud! I am glad to have made youryooacquaintance, though, Karamazov. I wanted to know you for a long time. Iyooam only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances.”yooyooKolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and moreyoodemonstrative, but he felt ill at ease. Alyosha noticed this, smiled, andyoopressed his hand.yooyoo“I’ve long learned to respect you as a rare person,” Kolya muttered again,yoofaltering and uncertain. “I have heard you are a mystic and have been inyoothe monastery. I know you are a mystic, but ... that hasn’t put me off.yooContact with real life will cure you.... It’s always so with charactersyoolike yours.”yooyoo“What do you mean by mystic? Cure me of what?” Alyosha was ratheryooastonished.yooyoo“Oh, God and all the rest of it.”yooyoo“What, don’t you believe in God?”yooyoo“Oh, I’ve nothing against God. Of course, God is only a hypothesis, butyoo... I admit that He is needed ... for the order of the universe and allyoothat ... and that if there were no God He would have to be invented,”yooadded Kolya, beginning to blush. He suddenly fancied that Alyosha mightyoothink he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he wasyoo“grown up.” “I haven’t the slightest desire to show off my knowledge toyoohim,” Kolya thought indignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horriblyyooannoyed.yooyoo“I must confess I can’t endure entering on such discussions,” he said withyooa final air. “It’s possible for one who doesn’t believe in God to loveyoomankind, don’t you think so? Voltaire didn’t believe in God and lovedyoomankind?” (“I am at it again,” he thought to himself.)yooyoo“Voltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I don’tyoothink he loved mankind very much either,” said Alyosha quietly, gently,yooand quite naturally, as though he were talking to some one of his own age,yooor even older. Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha’s apparentyoodiffidence about his opinion of Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving theyooquestion for him, little Kolya, to settle.yooyoo“Have you read Voltaire?” Alyosha finished.yooyoo“No, not to say read.... But I’ve read _Candide_ in the Russianyootranslation ... in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ... (At it again!yooagain!)”yooyoo“And did you understand it?”yooyoo“Oh, yes, everything.... That is ... Why do you suppose I shouldn’tyoounderstand it? There’s a lot of nastiness in it, of course.... Of course Iyoocan understand that it’s a philosophical novel and written to advocate anyooidea....” Kolya was getting mixed by now. “I am a Socialist, Karamazov, Iyooam an incurable Socialist,” he announced suddenly, apropos of nothing.yooyoo“A Socialist?” laughed Alyosha. “But when have you had time to become one?yooWhy, I thought you were only thirteen?”yooyooKolya winced.yooyoo“In the first place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen in ayoofortnight,” he flushed angrily, “and in the second place I am at ayoocomplete loss to understand what my age has to do with it? The question isyoowhat are my convictions, not what is my age, isn’t it?”yooyoo“When you are older, you’ll understand for yourself the influence of ageyooon convictions. I fancied, too, that you were not expressing your ownyooideas,” Alyosha answered serenely and modestly, but Kolya interrupted himyoohotly:yooyoo“Come, you want obedience and mysticism. You must admit that the Christianyooreligion, for instance, has only been of use to the rich and the powerfulyooto keep the lower classes in slavery. That’s so, isn’t it?”yooyoo“Ah, I know where you read that, and I am sure some one told you so!”yoocried Alyosha.yooyoo“I say, what makes you think I read it? And certainly no one told me so. Iyoocan think for myself.... I am not opposed to Christ, if you like. He was ayoomost humane person, and if He were alive to-day, He would be found in theyooranks of the revolutionists, and would perhaps play a conspicuous part....yooThere’s no doubt about that.”yooyoo“Oh, where, where did you get that from? What fool have you made friendsyoowith?” exclaimed Alyosha.yooyoo“Come, the truth will out! It has so chanced that I have often talked toyooMr. Rakitin, of course, but ... old Byelinsky said that, too, so theyyoosay.”yooyoo“Byelinsky? I don’t remember. He hasn’t written that anywhere.”yooyoo“If he didn’t write it, they say he said it. I heard that from a ... butyoonever mind.”yooyoo“And have you read Byelinsky?”yooyoo“Well, no ... I haven’t read all of him, but ... I read the passage aboutyooTatyana, why she didn’t go off with Onyegin.”yooyoo“Didn’t go off with Onyegin? Surely you don’t ... understand thatyooalready?”yooyoo“Why, you seem to take me for little Smurov,” said Kolya, with a grin ofyooirritation. “But please don’t suppose I am such a revolutionist. I oftenyoodisagree with Mr. Rakitin. Though I mention Tatyana, I am not at all foryoothe emancipation of women. I acknowledge that women are a subject race andyoomust obey. _Les femmes tricottent_, as Napoleon said.” Kolya, for someyooreason, smiled, “And on that question at least I am quite of one mind withyoothat pseudo-great man. I think, too, that to leave one’s own country andyoofly to America is mean, worse than mean—silly. Why go to America when oneyoomay be of great service to humanity here? Now especially. There’s ayooperfect mass of fruitful activity open to us. That’s what I answered.”yooyoo“What do you mean? Answered whom? Has some one suggested your going toyooAmerica already?”yooyoo“I must own, they’ve been at me to go, but I declined. That’s betweenyooourselves, of course, Karamazov; do you hear, not a word to any one. I sayyoothis only to you. I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of theyoosecret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge.yooyooyoo    _Long will you remember_yoo    _The house at the Chain bridge._yooyooyooDo you remember? It’s splendid. Why are you laughing? You don’t suppose Iyooam fibbing, do you?” (“What if he should find out that I’ve only that oneyoonumber of _The Bell_ in father’s bookcase, and haven’t read any more ofyooit?” Kolya thought with a shudder.)yooyoo“Oh, no, I am not laughing and don’t suppose for a moment that you areyoolying. No, indeed, I can’t suppose so, for all this, alas! is perfectlyyootrue. But tell me, have you read Pushkin—_Onyegin_, for instance?... Youyoospoke just now of Tatyana.”yooyoo“No, I haven’t read it yet, but I want to read it. I have no prejudices,yooKaramazov; I want to hear both sides. What makes you ask?”yooyoo“Oh, nothing.”yooyoo“Tell me, Karamazov, have you an awful contempt for me?” Kolya rapped outyoosuddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha, as though he were on drill.yoo“Be so kind as to tell me, without beating about the bush.”yooyoo“I have a contempt for you?” Alyosha looked at him wondering. “What for? Iyooam only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted byyooall this crude nonsense before you have begun life.”yooyoo“Don’t be anxious about my nature,” Kolya interrupted, not withoutyoocomplacency. “But it’s true that I am stupidly sensitive, crudelyyoosensitive. You smiled just now, and I fancied you seemed to—”yooyoo“Oh, my smile meant something quite different. I’ll tell you why I smiled.yooNot long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived inyooRussia, on our students and schoolboys of to-day. ‘Show a Russianyooschoolboy,’ he writes, ‘a map of the stars, which he knows nothing about,yooand he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it.’ Noyooknowledge and unbounded conceit—that’s what the German meant to say aboutyoothe Russian schoolboy.”yooyoo“Yes, that’s perfectly right,” Kolya laughed suddenly, “exactly so! Bravoyoothe German! But he did not see the good side, what do you think? Conceityoomay be, that comes from youth, that will be corrected if need be, but, onyoothe other hand, there is an independent spirit almost from childhood,yooboldness of thought and conviction, and not the spirit of these sausageyoomakers, groveling before authority.... But the German was right all theyoosame. Bravo the German! But Germans want strangling all the same. Thoughyoothey are so good at science and learning they must be strangled.”yooyoo“Strangled, what for?” smiled Alyosha.yooyoo“Well, perhaps I am talking nonsense, I agree. I am awfully childishyoosometimes, and when I am pleased about anything I can’t restrain myselfyooand am ready to talk any stuff. But, I say, we are chattering away hereyooabout nothing, and that doctor has been a long time in there. But perhapsyoohe’s examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina. I liked that Nina,yooyou know. She whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away, ‘Why didn’tyooyou come before?’ And in such a voice, so reproachfully! I think she isyooawfully nice and pathetic.”yooyoo“Yes, yes! Well, you’ll be coming often, you will see what she is like. Ityoowould do you a great deal of good to know people like that, to learn toyoovalue a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people,”yooAlyosha observed warmly. “That would have more effect on you thanyooanything.”yooyoo“Oh, how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner!” Kolyayooexclaimed, with bitter feeling.yooyoo“Yes, it’s a great pity. You saw for yourself how delighted the poor childyoowas to see you. And how he fretted for you to come!”yooyoo“Don’t tell me! You make it worse! But it serves me right. What kept meyoofrom coming was my conceit, my egoistic vanity, and the beastlyyoowilfullness, which I never can get rid of, though I’ve been strugglingyoowith it all my life. I see that now. I am a beast in lots of ways,yooKaramazov!”yooyoo“No, you have a charming nature, though it’s been distorted, and I quiteyoounderstand why you have had such an influence on this generous, morbidlyyoosensitive boy,” Alyosha answered warmly.yooyoo“And you say that to me!” cried Kolya; “and would you believe it, Iyoothought—I’ve thought several times since I’ve been here—that you despisedyoome! If only you knew how I prize your opinion!”yooyoo“But are you really so sensitive? At your age! Would you believe it, justyoonow, when you were telling your story, I thought, as I watched you, thatyooyou must be very sensitive!”yooyoo“You thought so? What an eye you’ve got, I say! I bet that was when I wasyootalking about the goose. That was just when I was fancying you had a greatyoocontempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off, and for a moment Iyooquite hated you for it, and began talking like a fool. Then I fancied—justyoonow, here—when I said that if there were no God He would have to beyooinvented, that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge,yooespecially as I got that phrase out of a book. But I swear I wasn’tyooshowing off out of vanity, though I really don’t know why. Because I wasyooso pleased? Yes, I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though it’syooperfectly disgraceful for any one to be gushing directly they are pleased,yooI know that. But I am convinced now that you don’t despise me; it was allyoomy imagination. Oh, Karamazov, I am profoundly unhappy. I sometimes fancyyooall sorts of things, that every one is laughing at me, the whole world,yooand then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things.”yooyoo“And you worry every one about you,” smiled Alyosha.yooyoo“Yes, I worry every one about me, especially my mother. Karamazov, tellyoome, am I very ridiculous now?”yooyoo“Don’t think about that, don’t think of it at all!” cried Alyosha. “Andyoowhat does ridiculous mean? Isn’t every one constantly being or seemingyooridiculous? Besides, nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid ofyoobeing ridiculous, and that makes them unhappy. All I am surprised at isyoothat you should be feeling that so early, though I’ve observed it for someyootime past, and not only in you. Nowadays the very children have begun toyoosuffer from it. It’s almost a sort of insanity. The devil has taken theyooform of that vanity and entered into the whole generation; it’s simply theyoodevil,” added Alyosha, without a trace of the smile that Kolya, staring atyoohim, expected to see. “You are like every one else,” said Alyosha, inyooconclusion, “that is, like very many others. Only you must not be likeyooeverybody else, that’s all.”yooyoo“Even if every one is like that?”yooyoo“Yes, even if every one is like that. You be the only one not like it. Youyooreally are not like every one else, here you are not ashamed to confess toyoosomething bad and even ridiculous. And who will admit so much in theseyoodays? No one. And people have even ceased to feel the impulse toyooself-criticism. Don’t be like every one else, even if you are the onlyyooone.”yooyoo“Splendid! I was not mistaken in you. You know how to console one. Oh, howyooI have longed to know you, Karamazov! I’ve long been eager for thisyoomeeting. Can you really have thought about me, too? You said just now thatyooyou thought of me, too?”yooyoo“Yes, I’d heard of you and had thought of you, too ... and if it’s partlyyoovanity that makes you ask, it doesn’t matter.”yooyoo“Do you know, Karamazov, our talk has been like a declaration of love,”yoosaid Kolya, in a bashful and melting voice. “That’s not ridiculous, isyooit?”yooyoo“Not at all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldn’t matter, because it’syoobeen a good thing.” Alyosha smiled brightly.yooyoo“But do you know, Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little ashamedyooyourself, now.... I see it by your eyes.” Kolya smiled with a sort of slyyoohappiness.yooyoo“Why ashamed?”yooyoo“Well, why are you blushing?”yooyoo“It was you made me blush,” laughed Alyosha, and he really did blush. “Oh,yoowell, I am a little, goodness knows why, I don’t know...” he muttered,yooalmost embarrassed.yooyoo“Oh, how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you areyoorather ashamed! Because you are just like me,” cried Kolya, in positiveyooecstasy. His cheeks glowed, his eyes beamed.yooyoo“You know, Kolya, you will be very unhappy in your life,” something madeyooAlyosha say suddenly.yooyoo“I know, I know. How you know it all beforehand!” Kolya agreed at once.yooyoo“But you will bless life on the whole, all the same.”yooyoo“Just so, hurrah! You are a prophet. Oh, we shall get on together,yooKaramazov! Do you know, what delights me most, is that you treat me quiteyoolike an equal. But we are not equals, no, we are not, you are better! Butyoowe shall get on. Do you know, all this last month, I’ve been saying toyoomyself, ‘Either we shall be friends at once, for ever, or we shall partyooenemies to the grave!’ ”yooyoo“And saying that, of course, you loved me,” Alyosha laughed gayly.yooyoo“I did. I loved you awfully. I’ve been loving and dreaming of you. And howyoodo you know it all beforehand? Ah, here’s the doctor. Goodness! What willyoohe tell us? Look at his face!”yooyooyooyooChapter VII. IlushayooyooyooThe doctor came out of the room again, muffled in his fur coat and withyoohis cap on his head. His face looked almost angry and disgusted, as thoughyoohe were afraid of getting dirty. He cast a cursory glance round theyoopassage, looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so. Alyosha wavedyoofrom the door to the coachman, and the carriage that had brought theyoodoctor drove up. The captain darted out after the doctor, and, bowingyooapologetically, stopped him to get the last word. The poor fellow lookedyooutterly crushed; there was a scared look in his eyes.yooyoo“Your Excellency, your Excellency ... is it possible?” he began, but couldyoonot go on and clasped his hands in despair. Yet he still gazed imploringlyyooat the doctor, as though a word from him might still change the poor boy’syoofate.yooyoo“I can’t help it, I am not God!” the doctor answered offhand, though withyoothe customary impressiveness.yooyoo“Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon, soon?”yooyoo“You must be prepared for anything,” said the doctor in emphatic andyooincisive tones, and dropping his eyes, he was about to step out to theyoocoach.yooyoo“Your Excellency, for Christ’s sake!” the terror-stricken captain stoppedyoohim again. “Your Excellency! but can nothing, absolutely nothing save himyoonow?”yooyoo“It’s not in my hands now,” said the doctor impatiently, “but h’m!...” heyoostopped suddenly. “If you could, for instance ... send ... your patientyoo... at once, without delay” (the words “at once, without delay,” theyoodoctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captainyoostart) “to Syracuse, the change to the new be-ne-ficial climaticyooconditions might possibly effect—”yooyoo“To Syracuse!” cried the captain, unable to grasp what was said.yooyoo“Syracuse is in Sicily,” Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation. Theyoodoctor looked at him.yooyoo“Sicily! your Excellency,” faltered the captain, “but you’ve seen”—heyoospread out his hands, indicating his surroundings—“mamma and my family?”yooyoo“N—no, Sicily is not the place for the family, the family should go toyooCaucasus in the early spring ... your daughter must go to the Caucasus,yooand your wife ... after a course of the waters in the Caucasus for heryoorheumatism ... must be sent straight to Paris to the mental specialistyooLepelletier; I could give you a note to him, and then ... there might be ayoochange—”yooyoo“Doctor, doctor! But you see!” The captain flung wide his hands againyoodespairingly, indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage.yooyoo“Well, that’s not my business,” grinned the doctor. “I have only told youyoothe answer of medical science to your question as to possible treatment.yooAs for the rest, to my regret—”yooyoo“Don’t be afraid, apothecary, my dog won’t bite you,” Kolya rapped outyooloudly, noticing the doctor’s rather uneasy glance at Perezvon, who wasyoostanding in the doorway. There was a wrathful note in Kolya’s voice. Heyooused the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose, and, as heyooexplained afterwards, used it “to insult him.”yooyoo“What’s that?” The doctor flung up his head, staring with surprise atyooKolya. “Who’s this?” he addressed Alyosha, as though asking him toyooexplain.yooyoo“It’s Perezvon’s master, don’t worry about me,” Kolya said incisivelyyooagain.yooyoo“Perezvon?”(7) repeated the doctor, perplexed.yooyoo“He hears the bell, but where it is he cannot tell. Good-by, we shall meetyooin Syracuse.”yooyoo“Who’s this? Who’s this?” The doctor flew into a terrible rage.yooyoo“He is a schoolboy, doctor, he is a mischievous boy; take no notice ofyoohim,” said Alyosha, frowning and speaking quickly. “Kolya, hold youryootongue!” he cried to Krassotkin. “Take no notice of him, doctor,” heyoorepeated, rather impatiently.yooyoo“He wants a thrashing, a good thrashing!” The doctor stamped in a perfectyoofury.yooyoo“And you know, apothecary, my Perezvon might bite!” said Kolya, turningyoopale, with quivering voice and flashing eyes. “_Ici_, Perezvon!”yooyoo“Kolya, if you say another word, I’ll have nothing more to do with you,”yooAlyosha cried peremptorily.yooyoo“There is only one man in the world who can command NikolayyooKrassotkin—this is the man”; Kolya pointed to Alyosha. “I obey him,yoogood-by!”yooyooHe stepped forward, opened the door, and quickly went into the inner room.yooPerezvon flew after him. The doctor stood still for five seconds inyooamazement, looking at Alyosha; then, with a curse, he went out quickly toyoothe carriage, repeating aloud, “This is ... this is ... I don’t know whatyooit is!” The captain darted forward to help him into the carriage. Alyoshayoofollowed Kolya into the room. He was already by Ilusha’s bedside. The sickyooboy was holding his hand and calling for his father. A minute later theyoocaptain, too, came back.yooyoo“Father, father, come ... we ...” Ilusha faltered in violent excitement,yoobut apparently unable to go on, he flung his wasted arms round his fatheryooand Kolya, uniting them in one embrace, and hugging them as tightly as heyoocould. The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs, and Kolya’syoolips and chin twitched.yooyoo“Father, father! How sorry I am for you!” Ilusha moaned bitterly.yooyoo“Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... weyooshall be happy ... the doctor ...” the captain began.yooyoo“Ah, father! I know what the new doctor said to you about me.... I saw!”yoocried Ilusha, and again he hugged them both with all his strength, hidingyoohis face on his father’s shoulder.yooyoo“Father, don’t cry, and when I die get a good boy, another one ... chooseyooone of them all, a good one, call him Ilusha and love him instead ofyoome....”yooyoo“Hush, old man, you’ll get well,” Krassotkin cried suddenly, in a voiceyoothat sounded angry.yooyoo“But don’t ever forget me, father,” Ilusha went on, “come to my grave ...yooand, father, bury me by our big stone, where we used to go for our walk,yooand come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening ... and Perezvon ... Iyooshall expect you.... Father, father!”yooyooHis voice broke. They were all three silent, still embracing. Nina wasyoocrying quietly in her chair, and at last seeing them all crying, “mamma,”yootoo, burst into tears.yooyoo“Ilusha! Ilusha!” she exclaimed.yooyooKrassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilusha’s embrace.yooyoo“Good-by, old man, mother expects me back to dinner,” he said quickly.yoo“What a pity I did not tell her! She will be dreadfully anxious.... Butyooafter dinner I’ll come back to you for the whole day, for the wholeyooevening, and I’ll tell you all sorts of things, all sorts of things. AndyooI’ll bring Perezvon, but now I will take him with me, because he willyoobegin to howl when I am away and bother you. Good-by!”yooyooAnd he ran out into the passage. He didn’t want to cry, but in the passageyoohe burst into tears. Alyosha found him crying.yooyoo“Kolya, you must be sure to keep your word and come, or he will beyooterribly disappointed,” Alyosha said emphatically.yooyoo“I will! Oh, how I curse myself for not having come before!” mutteredyooKolya, crying, and no longer ashamed of it.yooyooAt that moment the captain flew out of the room, and at once closed theyoodoor behind him. His face looked frenzied, his lips were trembling. Heyoostood before the two and flung up his arms.yooyoo“I don’t want a good boy! I don’t want another boy!” he muttered in a wildyoowhisper, clenching his teeth. “If I forget thee, Jerusalem, may myyootongue—” He broke off with a sob and sank on his knees before the woodenyoobench. Pressing his fists against his head, he began sobbing with absurdyoowhimpering cries, doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard inyoothe room.yooyooKolya ran out into the street.yooyoo“Good-by, Karamazov? Will you come yourself?” he cried sharply and angrilyyooto Alyosha.yooyoo“I will certainly come in the evening.”yooyoo“What was that he said about Jerusalem?... What did he mean by that?”yooyoo“It’s from the Bible. ‘If I forget thee, Jerusalem,’ that is, if I forgetyooall that is most precious to me, if I let anything take its place, thenyoomay—”yooyoo“I understand, that’s enough! Mind you come! _Ici_, Perezvon!” he criedyoowith positive ferocity to the dog, and with rapid strides he went home.yooyooyooyooyooBook XI. IvanyooyooyooyooChapter I. At Grushenka’syooyooyooAlyosha went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov’s house toyoosee Grushenka, who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with anyoourgent message begging him to come. Questioning Fenya, Alyosha learnedyoothat her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day.yooDuring the two months that had passed since Mitya’s arrest, Alyosha hadyoocalled frequently at the widow Morozov’s house, both from his ownyooinclination and to take messages for Mitya. Three days after Mitya’syooarrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks.yooFor one whole week she was unconscious. She was very much changed—thinneryooand a little sallow, though she had for the past fortnight been wellyooenough to go out. But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive thanyoobefore, and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her. A look ofyoofirmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face. There wereyoosigns of a spiritual transformation in her, and a steadfast, fine andyoohumble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her.yooThere was a small vertical line between her brows which gave her charmingyooface a look of concentrated thought, almost austere at the first glance.yooThere was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity.yooyooIt seemed strange to Alyosha, too, that in spite of the calamity that hadyooovertaken the poor girl, betrothed to a man who had been arrested for ayooterrible crime, almost at the instant of their betrothal, in spite of heryooillness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over Mitya, Grushenkayoohad not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness. There was a soft light in theyooonce proud eyes, though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fireyoowhen she was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever in heryooheart. The object of that uneasiness was the same as ever—KaterinayooIvanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay in delirium.yooAlyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her. Yet Katerina Ivanovnayoohad not once visited Mitya in his prison, though she might have done ityoowhenever she liked. All this made a difficult problem for Alyosha, for heyoowas the only person to whom Grushenka opened her heart and from whom sheyoowas continually asking advice. Sometimes he was unable to say anything.yooyooFull of anxiety he entered her lodging. She was at home. She had returnedyoofrom seeing Mitya half an hour before, and from the rapid movement withyoowhich she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw that she had beenyooexpecting him with great impatience. A pack of cards dealt for a game ofyoo“fools” lay on the table. A bed had been made up on the leather sofa onyoothe other side and Maximov lay, half-reclining, on it. He wore ayoodressing-gown and a cotton nightcap, and was evidently ill and weak,yoothough he was smiling blissfully. When the homeless old man returned withyooGrushenka from Mokroe two months before, he had simply stayed on and wasyoostill staying with her. He arrived with her in rain and sleet, sat down onyoothe sofa, drenched and scared, and gazed mutely at her with a timid,yooappealing smile. Grushenka, who was in terrible grief and in the firstyoostage of fever, almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the firstyoohalf-hour after her arrival. Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently:yoohe laughed a pitiful, helpless little laugh. She called Fenya and told heryooto give him something to eat. All that day he sat in the same place,yooalmost without stirring. When it got dark and the shutters were closed,yooFenya asked her mistress:yooyoo“Is the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?”yooyoo“Yes; make him a bed on the sofa,” answered Grushenka.yooyooQuestioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that he hadyooliterally nowhere to go, and that “Mr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told meyoostraight that he wouldn’t receive me again and gave me five roubles.”yooyoo“Well, God bless you, you’d better stay, then,” Grushenka decided in heryoogrief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile wrung the old man’s heartyooand his lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the destitute wandereryoohad stayed with her ever since. He did not leave the house even when sheyoowas ill. Fenya and her grandmother, the cook, did not turn him out, butyoowent on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa. Grushenka hadyoogrown used to him, and coming back from seeing Mitya (whom she had begunyooto visit in prison before she was really well) she would sit down andyoobegin talking to “Maximushka” about trifling matters, to keep her fromyoothinking of her sorrow. The old man turned out to be a good story-telleryooon occasions, so that at last he became necessary to her. Grushenka sawyooscarcely any one else beside Alyosha, who did not come every day and neveryoostayed long. Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time, “at his lastyoogasp” as they said in the town, and he did, in fact, die a week afteryooMitya’s trial. Three weeks before his death, feeling the end approaching,yoohe made his sons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him at lastyooand bade them not leave him again. From that moment he gave strict ordersyooto his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came, “Theyoomaster wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him.”yooBut Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him.yooyoo“You’ve come at last!” she cried, flinging down the cards and joyfullyyoogreeting Alyosha, “and Maximushka’s been scaring me that perhaps youyoowouldn’t come. Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table. What will youyoohave—coffee?”yooyoo“Yes, please,” said Alyosha, sitting down at the table. “I am veryyoohungry.”yooyoo“That’s right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,” cried Grushenka. “It’s been made ayoolong time ready for you. And bring some little pies, and mind they areyoohot. Do you know, we’ve had a storm over those pies to-day. I took them toyoothe prison for him, and would you believe it, he threw them back to me: heyoowould not eat them. He flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it.yooSo I said to him: ‘I shall leave them with the warder; if you don’t eatyoothem before evening, it will be that your venomous spite is enough foryooyou!’ With that I went away. We quarreled again, would you believe it?yooWhenever I go we quarrel.”yooyooGrushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation. Maximov, feelingyoonervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor.yooyoo“What did you quarrel about this time?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“I didn’t expect it in the least. Only fancy, he is jealous of the Pole.yoo‘Why are you keeping him?’ he said. ‘So you’ve begun keeping him.’ He isyoojealous, jealous of me all the time, jealous eating and sleeping! He evenyootook it into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last week.”yooyoo“But he knew about the Pole before?”yooyoo“Yes, but there it is. He has known about him from the very beginning, butyooto-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him. I am ashamed toyoorepeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came out. PerhapsyooRakitin is egging him on. What do you think?” she added carelessly.yooyoo“He loves you, that’s what it is: he loves you so much. And now he isyooparticularly worried.”yooyoo“I should think he might be, with the trial to-morrow. And I went to himyooto say something about to-morrow, for I dread to think what’s going toyoohappen then. You say that he is worried, but how worried I am! And heyootalks about the Pole! He’s too silly! He is not jealous of Maximushka yet,yooanyway.”yooyoo“My wife was dreadfully jealous over me, too,” Maximov put in his word.yooyoo“Jealous of you?” Grushenka laughed in spite of herself. “Of whom couldyooshe have been jealous?”yooyoo“Of the servant girls.”yooyoo“Hold your tongue, Maximushka, I am in no laughing mood now; I feel angry.yooDon’t ogle the pies. I shan’t give you any; they are not good for you, andyooI won’t give you any vodka either. I have to look after him, too, just asyoothough I kept an almshouse,” she laughed.yooyoo“I don’t deserve your kindness. I am a worthless creature,” said Maximov,yoowith tears in his voice. “You would do better to spend your kindness onyoopeople of more use than me.”yooyoo“Ech, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who’s of mostyoouse? If only that Pole didn’t exist, Alyosha. He’s taken it into his headyooto fall ill, too, to-day. I’ve been to see him also. And I shall send himyoosome pies, too, on purpose. I hadn’t sent him any, but Mitya accused me ofyooit, so now I shall send some! Ah, here’s Fenya with a letter! Yes, it’syoofrom the Poles—begging again!”yooyooPan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristicallyyooeloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles. In theyooletter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay ityoowithin three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka hadyooreceived many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her formeryoolover during the fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the twoyooPoles had been to ask after her health during her illness. The firstyooletter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaperyooand with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and rhetoricalyoothat Grushenka put it down before she had read half, unable to make headyooor tail of it. She could not attend to letters then. The first letter wasyoofollowed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for ayooloan of two thousand roubles for a very short period. Grushenka left thatyooletter, too, unanswered. A whole series of letters had followed—one everyyooday—all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, graduallyyoodiminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty-five, to ten,yooand finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged heryoofor only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both.yooyooThen Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she went roundyooherself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in great poverty, almostyoodestitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt to theiryoolandlady. The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya atyooMokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at their meetingyooher with arrogant dignity and self-assertion, with the greatest punctilioyooand pompous speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her formeryooadmirer ten roubles. Then, laughing, she told Mitya of it and he was notyooin the least jealous. But ever since, the Poles had attached themselves toyooGrushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she hadyooalways sent them small sums. And now that day Mitya had taken it into hisyoohead to be fearfully jealous.yooyoo“Like a fool, I went round to him just for a minute, on the way to seeyooMitya, for he is ill, too, my Pole,” Grushenka began again with nervousyoohaste. “I was laughing, telling Mitya about it. ‘Fancy,’ I said, ‘my Poleyoohad the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar. Heyoothought I would be touched and marry him!’ Mitya leapt up swearing.... So,yoothere, I’ll send them the pies! Fenya, is it that little girl they’veyoosent? Here, give her three roubles and pack a dozen pies up in a paper andyootell her to take them. And you, Alyosha, be sure to tell Mitya that I didyoosend them the pies.”yooyoo“I wouldn’t tell him for anything,” said Alyosha, smiling.yooyoo“Ech! You think he is unhappy about it. Why, he’s jealous on purpose. Heyoodoesn’t care,” said Grushenka bitterly.yooyoo“On purpose?” queried Alyosha.yooyoo“I tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know nothing about it, with allyooyour cleverness. I am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like me. Iyoowould be offended if he were not jealous. I am like that. I am notyoooffended at jealousy. I have a fierce heart, too. I can be jealous myself.yooOnly what offends me is that he doesn’t love me at all. I tell you he isyoojealous now _on purpose_. Am I blind? Don’t I see? He began talking to meyoojust now of that woman, of Katerina, saying she was this and that, how sheyoohad ordered a doctor from Moscow for him, to try and save him; how she hadyooordered the best counsel, the most learned one, too. So he loves her, ifyoohe’ll praise her to my face, more shame to him! He’s treated me badlyyoohimself, so he attacked me, to make out I am in fault first and to throwyooit all on me. ‘You were with your Pole before me, so I can’t be blamed foryooKaterina,’ that’s what it amounts to. He wants to throw the whole blame onyoome. He attacked me on purpose, on purpose, I tell you, but I’ll—”yooyooGrushenka could not finish saying what she would do. She hid her eyes inyooher handkerchief and sobbed violently.yooyoo“He doesn’t love Katerina Ivanovna,” said Alyosha firmly.yooyoo“Well, whether he loves her or not, I’ll soon find out for myself,” saidyooGrushenka, with a menacing note in her voice, taking the handkerchief fromyooher eyes. Her face was distorted. Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from beingyoomild and serene, it had become sullen and spiteful.yooyoo“Enough of this foolishness,” she said suddenly; “it’s not for that I sentyoofor you. Alyosha, darling, to-morrow—what will happen to-morrow? That’syoowhat worries me! And it’s only me it worries! I look at every one and noyooone is thinking of it. No one cares about it. Are you thinking about ityooeven? To-morrow he’ll be tried, you know. Tell me, how will he be tried?yooYou know it’s the valet, the valet killed him! Good heavens! Can theyyoocondemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him? Theyyoohaven’t troubled the valet at all, have they?”yooyoo“He’s been severely cross-examined,” observed Alyosha thoughtfully; “butyooevery one came to the conclusion it was not he. Now he is lying very ill.yooHe has been ill ever since that attack. Really ill,” added Alyosha.yooyoo“Oh, dear! couldn’t you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the wholeyoothing by yourself? He’s been brought from Petersburg for three thousandyooroubles, they say.”yooyoo“We gave these three thousand together—Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna and I—butyooshe paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself. The counselyooFetyukovitch would have charged more, but the case has become known allyooover Russia; it’s talked of in all the papers and journals. Fetyukovitchyooagreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because the case hasyoobecome so notorious. I saw him yesterday.”yooyoo“Well? Did you talk to him?” Grushenka put in eagerly.yooyoo“He listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already formed hisyooopinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.”yooyoo“Consideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They’ll ruin him. And why did sheyoosend for the doctor?”yooyoo“As an expert. They want to prove that Mitya’s mad and committed theyoomurder when he didn’t know what he was doing”; Alyosha smiled gently; “butyooMitya won’t agree to that.”yooyoo“Yes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!” cried Grushenka.yoo“He was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault, wretch that I am!yooBut, of course, he didn’t do it, he didn’t do it! And they are all againstyoohim, the whole town. Even Fenya’s evidence went to prove he had done it.yooAnd the people at the shop, and that official, and at the tavern, too,yoobefore, people had heard him say so! They are all, all against him, allyoocrying out against him.”yooyoo“Yes, there’s a fearful accumulation of evidence,” Alyosha observedyoogrimly.yooyoo“And Grigory—Grigory Vassilyevitch—sticks to his story that the door wasyooopen, persists that he saw it—there’s no shaking him. I went and talked toyoohim myself. He’s rude about it, too.”yooyoo“Yes, that’s perhaps the strongest evidence against him,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“And as for Mitya’s being mad, he certainly seems like it now,” Grushenkayoobegan with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air. “Do you know, Alyosha,yooI’ve been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time. I go to himyooevery day and simply wonder at him. Tell me, now, what do you suppose he’syooalways talking about? He talks and talks and I can make nothing of it. Iyoofancied he was talking of something intellectual that I couldn’tyoounderstand in my foolishness. Only he suddenly began talking to me about ayoobabe—that is, about some child. ‘Why is the babe poor?’ he said. ‘It’s foryoothat babe I am going to Siberia now. I am not a murderer, but I must go toyooSiberia!’ What that meant, what babe, I couldn’t tell for the life of me.yooOnly I cried when he said it, because he said it so nicely. He criedyoohimself, and I cried, too. He suddenly kissed me and made the sign of theyoocross over me. What did it mean, Alyosha, tell me? What is this babe?”yooyoo“It must be Rakitin, who’s been going to see him lately,” smiled Alyosha,yoo“though ... that’s not Rakitin’s doing. I didn’t see Mitya yesterday. I’llyoosee him to-day.”yooyoo“No, it’s not Rakitin; it’s his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting him.yooIt’s his going to see him, that’s what it is,” Grushenka began, andyoosuddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement.yooyoo“Ivan’s going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself that Ivanyoohasn’t been once.”yooyoo“There ... there! What a girl I am! Blurring things out!” exclaimedyooGrushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. “Stay, Alyosha, hush! SinceyooI’ve said so much I’ll tell the whole truth—he’s been to see him twice,yoothe first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, ofyoocourse, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. Heyootold Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not toyootell any one, in fact. He came secretly.”yooyooAlyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidentlyyooimpressed him.yooyoo“Ivan doesn’t talk to me of Mitya’s case,” he said slowly. “He’s said veryyoolittle to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him, he seemsyoovexed at my coming, so I’ve not been to him for the last three weeks.yooH’m!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a changeyooin Mitya this week.”yooyoo“There has been a change,” Grushenka assented quickly. “They have ayoosecret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, andyoosuch a secret that Mitya can’t rest. Before then, he was cheerful—and,yooindeed, he is cheerful now—but when he shakes his head like that, youyooknow, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on hisyooright temple with his right hand, I know there is something on his mindyooworrying him.... I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he isyoocheerful to-day.”yooyoo“But you said he was worried.”yooyoo“Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for ayoominute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha,yooI am constantly wondering at him—with this awful thing hanging over him,yoohe sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.”yooyoo“And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, ‘Don’tyootell him’?”yooyoo“Yes, he told me, ‘Don’t tell him.’ It’s you that Mitya’s most afraid of.yooBecause it’s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling,yoogo to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,”yooGrushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. “Set my mind at rest that Iyoomay know the worst that’s in store for me. That’s why I sent for you.”yooyoo“You think it’s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn’t haveyootold you there was a secret.”yooyoo“I don’t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn’t dare to. He warnsyoome. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won’t tell me what it is.”yooyoo“What do you think yourself?”yooyoo“What do I think? It’s the end for me, that’s what I think. They all threeyoohave been plotting my end, for Katerina’s in it. It’s all Katerina, it allyoocomes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. Heyootells me that beforehand—warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that’syoothe whole secret. They’ve planned it together, the three of them—Mitya,yooKaterina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I’ve been wanting to ask you ayoolong time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love withyooKaterina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth oryoonot? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.”yooyoo“I won’t tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, Iyoothink.”yooyoo“Oh, that’s what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, that’syoowhat it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame onyoome afterwards. He is stupid, he can’t disguise what he is doing; he is soyooopen, you know.... But I’ll give it to him, I’ll give it to him! ‘Youyoobelieve I did it,’ he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached meyoowith that! God forgive him! You wait, I’ll make it hot for Katerina at theyootrial! I’ll just say a word then ... I’ll tell everything then!”yooyooAnd again she cried bitterly.yooyoo“This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,” Alyosha said, getting up.yoo“First, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, andyooyou only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don’tyoowant to worm his secret out of him, but if he’ll tell me of himselfyooto-day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you.yooThen I’ll come to you to-day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... KaterinayooIvanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about somethingyooelse. That’s certain. It isn’t likely it’s about Katerina Ivanovna, ityooseems to me. Good-by for now.”yooyooAlyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He saw that sheyooput little faith in his consolation, but she was better for having had heryoosorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was sorry to leave her in such ayoostate of mind, but he was in haste. He had a great many things to doyoostill.yooyooyooyooChapter II. The Injured FootyooyooyooThe first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov, and heyoohurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not be too lateyoofor Mitya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last threeyooweeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up, and though she was not inyoobed, she lay all day half-reclining on the couch in her boudoir, in ayoofascinating but decorous _déshabillé_. Alyosha had once noted withyooinnocent amusement that, in spite of her illness, Madame Hohlakov hadyoobegun to be rather dressy—top-knots, ribbons, loose wrappers, had madeyootheir appearance, and he had an inkling of the reason, though he dismissedyoosuch ideas from his mind as frivolous. During the last two months theyooyoung official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house.yooyooAlyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go straight toyooLise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had sent a maid to himyoothe previous day, specially asking him to come to her “about somethingyoovery important,” a request which, for certain reasons, had interest foryooAlyosha. But while the maid went to take his name in to Lise, MadameyooHohlakov heard of his arrival from some one, and immediately sent to begyoohim to come to her “just for one minute.” Alyosha reflected that it wasyoobetter to accede to the mamma’s request, or else she would be sending downyooto Lise’s room every minute that he was there. Madame Hohlakov was lyingyooon a couch. She was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in ayoostate of extreme nervous excitement. She greeted Alyosha with cries ofyoorapture.yooyoo“It’s ages, ages, perfect ages since I’ve seen you! It’s a whole week—onlyyoothink of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago, on Wednesday. Youyoohave come to see Lise. I’m sure you meant to slip into her room on tiptoe,yoowithout my hearing you. My dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you onlyyooknew how worried I am about her! But of that later, though that’s the mostyooimportant thing, of that later. Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust youyooimplicitly with my Lise. Since the death of Father Zossima—God rest hisyoosoul!” (she crossed herself)—“I look upon you as a monk, though you lookyoocharming in your new suit. Where did you find such a tailor in theseyooparts? No, no, that’s not the chief thing—of that later. Forgive me foryoosometimes calling you Alyosha; an old woman like me may take liberties,”yooshe smiled coquettishly; “but that will do later, too. The important thingyoois that I shouldn’t forget what is important. Please remind me of ityooyourself. As soon as my tongue runs away with me, you just say ‘theyooimportant thing?’ Ach! how do I know now what is of most importance? Everyoosince Lise took back her promise—her childish promise, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch—to marry you, you’ve realized, of course, that it was onlyyoothe playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to heryoochair—thank God, she can walk now!... that new doctor Katya sent for fromyooMoscow for your unhappy brother, who will to-morrow—But why speak ofyooto-morrow? I am ready to die at the very thought of to-morrow. Ready toyoodie of curiosity.... That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise.... Iyoopaid him fifty roubles for the visit. But that’s not the point, that’s notyoothe point again. You see, I’m mixing everything up. I am in such a hurry.yooWhy am I in a hurry? I don’t understand. It’s awful how I seem growingyoounable to understand anything. Everything seems mixed up in a sort ofyootangle. I am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away, andyoothat will be all I shall see of you. Goodness! Why are we sitting here andyoono coffee? Yulia, Glafira, coffee!”yooyooAlyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just hadyoocoffee.yooyoo“Where?”yooyoo“At Agrafena Alexandrovna’s.”yooyoo“At ... at that woman’s? Ah, it’s she has brought ruin on every one. Iyooknow nothing about it though. They say she has become a saint, though it’syoorather late in the day. She had better have done it before. What use is ityoonow? Hush, hush, Alexey Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to say to youyoothat I am afraid I shall tell you nothing. This awful trial ... I shallyoocertainly go, I am making arrangements. I shall be carried there in myyoochair; besides I can sit up. I shall have people with me. And, you know, Iyooam a witness. How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I don’t know what Iyooshall say. One has to take an oath, hasn’t one?”yooyoo“Yes; but I don’t think you will be able to go.”yooyoo“I can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage act, andyoothen they are all going to Siberia, some are getting married, and all thisyooso quickly, so quickly, everything’s changing, and at last—nothing. Allyoogrow old and have death to look forward to. Well, so be it! I am weary.yooThis Katya, _cette charmante personne_, has disappointed all my hopes. Nowyooshe is going to follow one of your brothers to Siberia, and your otheryoobrother is going to follow her, and will live in the nearest town, andyoothey will all torment one another. It drives me out of my mind. Worst ofyooall—the publicity. The story has been told a million times over in all theyoopapers in Moscow and Petersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it, there’s ayooparagraph that I was ‘a dear friend’ of your brother’s ——, I can’t repeatyoothe horrid word. Just fancy, just fancy!”yooyoo“Impossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?”yooyoo“I’ll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday. Here, inyoothe Petersburg paper _Gossip_. The paper began coming out this year. I amyooawfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now it pays me out—this isyoowhat gossip comes to! Here it is, here, this passage. Read it.”yooyooAnd she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under heryoopillow.yooyooIt was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed and perhapsyooeverything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head. The paragraph wasyoovery typical, and must have been a great shock to her, but, fortunatelyyooperhaps, she was unable to keep her mind fixed on any one subject at thatyoomoment, and so might race off in a minute to something else and quiteyooforget the newspaper.yooyooAlyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread allyooover Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about his brother, aboutyoothe Karamazovs, and about himself he had read in the course of those twoyoomonths, among other equally credible items! One paper had even stated thatyoohe had gone into a monastery and become a monk, in horror at his brother’syoocrime. Another contradicted this, and stated that he and his elder, FatheryooZossima, had broken into the monastery chest and “made tracks from theyoomonastery.” The present paragraph in the paper _Gossip_ was under theyooheading, “The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk.” (That, alas! was theyooname of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.) It was brief,yooand Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it. No names appeared,yooin fact. It was merely stated that the criminal, whose approaching trialyoowas making such a sensation—retired army captain, an idle swaggerer, andyooreactionary bully—was continually involved in amorous intrigues, andyooparticularly popular with certain ladies “who were pining in solitude.”yooOne such lady, a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had ayoogrown-up daughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before theyoocrime she offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that he wouldyooelope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting on escapingyoopunishment, had preferred to murder his father to get the three thousandyoorather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged charms of his piningyoolady. This playful paragraph finished, of course, with an outburst ofyoogenerous indignation at the wickedness of parricide and at the latelyyooabolished institution of serfdom. Reading it with curiosity, Alyoshayoofolded up the paper and handed it back to Madame Hohlakov.yooyoo“Well, that must be me,” she hurried on again. “Of course I am meant.yooScarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold mines to him, and hereyoothey talk of ‘middle-aged charms’ as though that were my motive! He writesyoothat out of spite! God Almighty forgive him for the middle-aged charms, asyooI forgive him! You know it’s— Do you know who it is? It’s your friendyooRakitin.”yooyoo“Perhaps,” said Alyosha, “though I’ve heard nothing about it.”yooyoo“It’s he, it’s he! No ‘perhaps’ about it. You know I turned him out of theyoohouse.... You know all that story, don’t you?”yooyoo“I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but why ityoowas, I haven’t heard ... from you, at least.”yooyoo“Ah, then you’ve heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose, abuses meyoodreadfully?”yooyoo“Yes, he does; but then he abuses every one. But why you’ve given him up Iyoohaven’t heard from him either. I meet him very seldom now, indeed. We areyoonot friends.”yooyoo“Well, then, I’ll tell you all about it. There’s no help for it, I’llyooconfess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame. Only ayoolittle, little point, so little that perhaps it doesn’t count. You see, myyoodear boy”—Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming, thoughyooenigmatic, smile played about her lips—“you see, I suspect ... You mustyooforgive me, Alyosha. I am like a mother to you.... No, no; quite theyoocontrary. I speak to you now as though you were my father—mother’s quiteyooout of place. Well, it’s as though I were confessing to Father Zossima,yoothat’s just it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man,yooyour friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I can’t be angry with him. I feelyoocross, but not very), that frivolous young man, would you believe it,yooseems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me. I onlyyoonoticed it later. At first—a month ago—he only began to come oftener toyoosee me, almost every day; though, of course, we were acquainted before. Iyooknew nothing about it ... and suddenly it dawned upon me, and I began toyoonotice things with surprise. You know, two months ago, that modest,yoocharming, excellent young man, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, who’s in theyooservice here, began to be a regular visitor at the house. You met him hereyooever so many times yourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man,yooisn’t he? He comes once every three days, not every day (though I shouldyoobe glad to see him every day), and always so well dressed. Altogether, Iyoolove young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he has almostyoothe mind of a statesman, he talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly,yoocertainly try and get promotion for him. He is a future diplomat. On thatyooawful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night. And youryoofriend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always stretches them out on theyoocarpet.... He began hinting at his feelings, in fact, and one day, as heyoowas going, he squeezed my hand terribly hard. My foot began to swellyoodirectly after he pressed my hand like that. He had met Pyotr Ilyitch hereyoobefore, and would you believe it, he is always gibing at him, growling atyoohim, for some reason. I simply looked at the way they went on together andyoolaughed inwardly. So I was sitting here alone—no, I was laid up then.yooWell, I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in, and onlyyoofancy! brought me some verses of his own composition—a short poem, on myyoobad foot: that is, he described my foot in a poem. Wait a minute—how didyooit go?yooyooyoo    A captivating little foot.yooyooyooIt began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I’ve got it here.yooI’ll show it to you later. But it’s a charming thing—charming; and, youyooknow, it’s not only about the foot, it had a good moral, too, a charmingyooidea, only I’ve forgotten it; in fact, it was just the thing for an album.yooSo, of course, I thanked him, and he was evidently flattered. I’d hardlyyoohad time to thank him when in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenlyyoolooked as black as night. I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way,yoofor Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses.yooI had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in. I showed PyotryooIlyitch the verses and didn’t say who was the author. But I am convincedyoothat he guessed, though he won’t own it to this day, and declares he hadyoono idea. But he says that on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh atyooonce, and fell to criticizing it. ‘Wretched doggerel,’ he said they were,yoo‘some divinity student must have written them,’ and with such vehemence,yoosuch vehemence! Then, instead of laughing, your friend flew into a rage.yoo‘Good gracious!’ I thought, ‘they’ll fly at each other.’ ‘It was I whoyoowrote them,’ said he. ‘I wrote them as a joke,’ he said, ‘for I think ityoodegrading to write verses.... But they are good poetry. They want to put ayoomonument to your Pushkin for writing about women’s feet, while I wroteyoowith a moral purpose, and you,’ said he, ‘are an advocate of serfdom.yooYou’ve no humane ideas,’ said he. ‘You have no modern enlightenedyoofeelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you are a mere official,’ heyoosaid, ‘and you take bribes.’ Then I began screaming and imploring them.yooAnd, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward. He at once took upyoothe most gentlemanly tone, looked at him sarcastically, listened, andyooapologized. ‘I’d no idea,’ said he. ‘I shouldn’t have said it, if I hadyooknown. I should have praised it. Poets are all so irritable,’ he said. Inyooshort, he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone. Heyooexplained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought he was inyooearnest. Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought, ‘Wouldyooit, or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out foryooshouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?’ And, would you believe it, Iyoolay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the proper thing or not.yooI kept worrying and worrying, and my heart began to beat, and I couldn’tyoomake up my mind whether to make an outcry or not. One voice seemed to beyootelling me, ‘Speak,’ and the other ‘No, don’t speak.’ And no sooner hadyoothe second voice said that than I cried out, and fainted. Of course, thereyoowas a fuss. I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, ‘It’s painful for me toyoosay it, but I don’t wish to see you in my house again.’ So I turned himyooout. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting ityooon. I wasn’t angry with him at all, really; but I suddenly fancied—thatyoowas what did it—that it would be such a fine scene.... And yet, believeyoome, it was quite natural, for I really shed tears and cried for severalyoodays afterwards, and then suddenly, one afternoon, I forgot all about it.yooSo it’s a fortnight since he’s been here, and I kept wondering whether heyoowould come again. I wondered even yesterday, then suddenly last night cameyoothis _Gossip_. I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He mustyoohave written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot, sent it,yooand they put it in. It was a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha, it’syooawful how I keep talking and don’t say what I want to say. Ah! the wordsyoocome of themselves!”yooyoo“It’s very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day,”yooAlyosha faltered.yooyoo“To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen, what is anyooaberration?”yooyoo“What aberration?” asked Alyosha, wondering.yooyoo“In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable.yooWhatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.”yooyoo“What do you mean?”yooyoo“I’ll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she is a charming, charming creature,yooonly I never can make out who it is she is in love with. She was with meyoosome time ago and I couldn’t get anything out of her. Especially as sheyoowon’t talk to me except on the surface now. She is always talking about myyoohealth and nothing else, and she takes up such a tone with me, too. Iyoosimply said to myself, ‘Well, so be it. I don’t care’... Oh, yes. I wasyootalking of aberration. This doctor has come. You know a doctor has come?yooOf course, you know it—the one who discovers madmen. You wrote for him.yooNo, it wasn’t you, but Katya. It’s all Katya’s doing. Well, you see, a manyoomay be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration. He may beyooconscious and know what he is doing and yet be in a state of aberration.yooAnd there’s no doubt that Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering fromyooaberration. They found out about aberration as soon as the law courts wereyooreformed. It’s all the good effect of the reformed law courts. The doctoryoohas been here and questioned me about that evening, about the gold mines.yoo‘How did he seem then?’ he asked me. He must have been in a state ofyooaberration. He came in shouting, ‘Money, money, three thousand! Give meyoothree thousand!’ and then went away and immediately did the murder. ‘Iyoodon’t want to murder him,’ he said, and he suddenly went and murdered him.yooThat’s why they’ll acquit him, because he struggled against it and yet heyoomurdered him.”yooyoo“But he didn’t murder him,” Alyosha interrupted rather sharply. He feltyoomore and more sick with anxiety and impatience.yooyoo“Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.”yooyoo“Grigory?” cried Alyosha.yooyoo“Yes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down,yooand then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch.”yooyoo“But why, why?”yooyoo“Suffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow DmitriyooFyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from aberration; heyoowent and committed the murder. As for his saying he didn’t, he very likelyyoodoesn’t remember. Only, you know, it’ll be better, ever so much better, ifyooDmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him. And that’s how it must have been, thoughyooI say it was Grigory. It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that’syoobetter, ever so much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killedyoohis father, I don’t defend that. Children ought to honor their parents,yooand yet it would be better if it were he, as you’d have nothing to cryyooover then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he wasyooconscious, but did not know what he was doing. Let them acquit him—that’syooso humane, and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are. I knewyoonothing about it, but they say they have been so a long time. And when Iyooheard it yesterday, I was so struck by it that I wanted to send for you atyooonce. And if he is acquitted, make him come straight from the law courtsyooto dinner with me, and I’ll have a party of friends, and we’ll drink toyoothe reformed law courts. I don’t believe he’d be dangerous; besides, I’llyooinvite a great many friends, so that he could always be led out if he didyooanything. And then he might be made a justice of the peace or something inyooanother town, for those who have been in trouble themselves make the bestyoojudges. And, besides, who isn’t suffering from aberration nowadays?—you,yooI, all of us are in a state of aberration, and there are ever so manyyooexamples of it: a man sits singing a song, suddenly something annoys him,yoohe takes a pistol and shoots the first person he comes across, and no oneyooblames him for it. I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. Theyoodoctors are always confirming; they confirm anything. Why, my Lise is in ayoostate of aberration. She made me cry again yesterday, and the day before,yootoo, and to-day I suddenly realized that it’s all due to aberration. Oh,yooLise grieves me so! I believe she’s quite mad. Why did she send for you?yooDid she send for you or did you come of yourself?”yooyoo“Yes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her.” Alyosha got upyooresolutely.yooyoo“Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that’s what’s mostyooimportant,” Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into tears. “Godyooknows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it’s no matter heryoosending for you on the sly, without telling her mother. But forgive me, Iyoocan’t trust my daughter so easily to your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch,yoothough I still consider him the most chivalrous young man. But only fancy,yoohe’s been to see Lise and I knew nothing about it!”yooyoo“How? What? When?” Alyosha was exceedingly surprised. He had not sat downyooagain and listened standing.yooyoo“I will tell you; that’s perhaps why I asked you to come, for I don’t knowyoonow why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch has been to see meyootwice, since he came back from Moscow. First time he came as a friend toyoocall on me, and the second time Katya was here and he came because heyooheard she was here. I didn’t, of course, expect him to come often, knowingyoowhat a lot he has to do as it is, _vous comprenez, cette affaire et layoomort terrible de votre papa_. But I suddenly heard he’d been here again,yoonot to see me but to see Lise. That’s six days ago now. He came, stayedyoofive minutes, and went away. And I didn’t hear of it till three daysyooafterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me. I sent for Liseyoodirectly. She laughed. ‘He thought you were asleep,’ she said, ‘and cameyooin to me to ask after your health.’ Of course, that’s how it happened. ButyooLise, Lise, mercy on us, how she distresses me! Would you believe it, oneyoonight, four days ago, just after you saw her last time, and had gone away,yooshe suddenly had a fit, screaming, shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I neveryoohave hysterics? Then, next day another fit, and the same thing on theyoothird, and yesterday too, and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenlyyooscreamed out, ‘I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never lettingyoohim come to the house again.’ I was struck dumb at these amazing words,yooand answered, ‘On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellentyooyoung man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?’—for allyoothis business is a misfortune, isn’t it? She suddenly burst out laughingyooat my words, and so rudely, you know. Well, I was pleased; I thought I hadyooamused her and the fits would pass off, especially as I wanted to refuseyooto see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his strange visits withoutyoomy knowledge, and meant to ask him for an explanation. But early thisyoomorning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would youyoobelieve it, slapped her in the face. That’s monstrous; I am always politeyooto my servants. And an hour later she was hugging Yulia’s feet and kissingyoothem. She sent a message to me that she wasn’t coming to me at all, andyoowould never come and see me again, and when I dragged myself down to her,yooshe rushed to kiss me, crying, and as she kissed me, she pushed me out ofyoothe room without saying a word, so I couldn’t find out what was theyoomatter. Now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I rest all my hopes on you, and, ofyoocourse, my whole life is in your hands. I simply beg you to go to Lise andyoofind out everything from her, as you alone can, and come back and tellyoome—me, her mother, for you understand it will be the death of me, simplyyoothe death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away. I can stand noyoomore. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then ... thenyoosomething awful will happen. Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr Ilyitch!” criedyooMadame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she saw Perhotin enter the room. “Youyooare late, you are late! Well, sit down, speak, put us out of suspense.yooWhat does the counsel say. Where are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?”yooyoo“To Lise.”yooyoo“Oh, yes. You won’t forget, you won’t forget what I asked you? It’s ayooquestion of life and death!”yooyoo“Of course, I won’t forget, if I can ... but I am so late,” mutteredyooAlyosha, beating a hasty retreat.yooyoo“No, be sure, be sure to come in; don’t say ‘If you can.’ I shall die ifyooyou don’t,” Madame Hohlakov called after him, but Alyosha had already leftyoothe room.yooyooyooyooChapter III. A Little DemonyooyooyooGoing in to Lise, he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair, inyoowhich she had been wheeled when she was unable to walk. She did not moveyooto meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were simply riveted on his face.yooThere was a feverish look in her eyes, her face was pale and yellow.yooAlyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in threeyoodays. She was positively thinner. She did not hold out her hand to him. Heyootouched the thin, long fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then heyoosat down facing her, without a word.yooyoo“I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,” Lise said curtly, “andyoomamma’s kept you there for hours; she’s just been telling you about me andyooYulia.”yooyoo“How do you know?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“I’ve been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen and I doyoolisten, there’s no harm in that. I don’t apologize.”yooyoo“You are upset about something?”yooyoo“On the contrary, I am very happy. I’ve only just been reflecting for theyoothirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be youryoowife. You are not fit to be a husband. If I were to marry you and give youyooa note to take to the man I loved after you, you’d take it and be sure toyoogive it to him and bring an answer back, too. If you were forty, you wouldyoostill go on taking my love-letters for me.”yooyooShe suddenly laughed.yooyoo“There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,” Alyoshayoosmiled to her.yooyoo“The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you.yooWhat’s more, I don’t want to feel ashamed with you, just with you.yooAlyosha, why is it I don’t respect you? I am very fond of you, but I don’tyoorespect you. If I respected you, I shouldn’t talk to you without shame,yooshould I?”yooyoo“No.”yooyoo“But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?”yooyoo“No, I don’t believe it.”yooyooLise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.yooyoo“I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison. Alyosha,yooyou know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully for having soyooquickly allowed me not to love you.”yooyoo“Why did you send for me to-day, Lise?”yooyoo“I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one toyootorture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go away. I don’tyoowant to be happy.”yooyoo“You are in love with disorder?”yooyoo“Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house. I keepyooimagining how I’ll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly; it mustyoobe on the sly. They’ll try to put it out, but it’ll go on burning. And Iyooshall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness! And how bored I am!”yooyooShe waved her hand with a look of repulsion.yooyoo“It’s your luxurious life,” said Alyosha, softly.yooyoo“Is it better, then, to be poor?”yooyoo“Yes, it is better.”yooyoo“That’s what your monk taught you. That’s not true. Let me be rich and allyoothe rest poor, I’ll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to any oneyooelse. Ach, don’t speak, don’t say anything,” she shook her hand at him,yoothough Alyosha had not opened his mouth. “You’ve told me all that before,yooI know it all by heart. It bores me. If I am ever poor, I shall murderyoosomebody, and even if I am rich, I may murder some one, perhaps—why doyoonothing! But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I’ll marryyooyou, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we’ll keep a colt,yooshall we? Do you know Kalganov?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“He is always wandering about, dreaming. He says, ‘Why live in real life?yooIt’s better to dream. One can dream the most delightful things, but realyoolife is a bore.’ But he’ll be married soon for all that; he’s been makingyoolove to me already. Can you spin tops?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Well, he’s just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set spinning andyoothen to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I marry him, I’ll keepyoohim spinning all his life. You are not ashamed to be with me?”yooyoo“No.”yooyoo“You are awfully cross, because I don’t talk about holy things. I don’tyoowant to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world for theyoogreatest sin? You must know all about that.”yooyoo“God will censure you.” Alyosha was watching her steadily.yooyoo“That’s just what I should like. I would go up and they would censure me,yooand I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should dreadfully like toyooset fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you still don’t believe me?”yooyoo“Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing to setyoofire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It’s a sort ofyoodisease.”yooyoo“That’s not true, that’s not true; there may be children, but that’s notyoowhat I mean.”yooyoo“You take evil for good; it’s a passing crisis, it’s the result of youryooillness, perhaps.”yooyoo“You do despise me, though! It’s simply that I don’t want to do good, Iyoowant to do evil, and it has nothing to do with illness.”yooyoo“Why do evil?”yooyoo“So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would be ifyooeverything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think of doing ayoofearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do it for a longyoowhile on the sly and suddenly every one would find it out. Every one willyoostand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all.yooThat would be awfully nice. Why would it be so nice, Alyosha?”yooyoo“I don’t know. It’s a craving to destroy something good or, as you say, toyooset fire to something. It happens sometimes.”yooyoo“I not only say it, I shall do it.”yooyoo“I believe you.”yooyoo“Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not lying oneyoolittle bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose toyooannoy you?”yooyoo“No, I don’t think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to doyoothat in it, too.”yooyoo“There is a little. I never can tell lies to you,” she declared, with ayoostrange fire in her eyes.yooyooWhat struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness. There was not ayootrace of humor or jesting in her face now, though, in old days, fun andyoogayety never deserted her even at her most “earnest” moments.yooyoo“There are moments when people love crime,” said Alyosha thoughtfully.yooyoo“Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one lovesyoocrime, they love it always, not at some ‘moments.’ You know, it’s asyoothough people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied aboutyooit ever since. They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly they allyoolove it.”yooyoo“And are you still reading nasty books?”yooyoo“Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I stealyoothem.”yooyoo“Aren’t you ashamed to destroy yourself?”yooyoo“I want to destroy myself. There’s a boy here, who lay down between theyoorailway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow! Listen, youryoobrother is being tried now for murdering his father and every one lovesyoohis having killed his father.”yooyoo“Loves his having killed his father?”yooyoo“Yes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says it’s so awful, butyoosecretly they simply love it. I for one love it.”yooyoo“There is some truth in what you say about every one,” said Alyoshayoosoftly.yooyoo“Oh, what ideas you have!” Lise shrieked in delight. “And you a monk, too!yooYou wouldn’t believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for never telling lies.yooOh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I sometimes dream of devils.yooIt’s night; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devilsyooall over the place, in all the corners, under the table, and they open theyoodoors; there’s a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come andyooseize me. And they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly crossyoomyself and they all draw back, though they don’t go away altogether, theyyoostand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have ayoofrightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then they comeyoocrowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and I cross myselfyooagain and they all draw back. It’s awful fun. it takes one’s breath away.”yooyoo“I’ve had the same dream, too,” said Alyosha suddenly.yooyoo“Really?” cried Lise, surprised. “I say, Alyosha, don’t laugh, that’syooawfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?”yooyoo“It seems they can.”yooyoo“Alyosha, I tell you, it’s awfully important,” Lise went on, with reallyyooexcessive amazement. “It’s not the dream that’s important, but your havingyoothe same dream as me. You never lie to me, don’t lie now: is it true? Youyooare not laughing?”yooyoo“It’s true.”yooyooLise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she wasyoosilent.yooyoo“Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,” she said suddenly,yooin a supplicating voice.yooyoo“I’ll always come to see you, all my life,” answered Alyosha firmly.yooyoo“You are the only person I can talk to, you know,” Lise began again. “Iyootalk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole world. And to youyoomore readily than to myself. And I am not a bit ashamed with you, not ayoobit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit? Alyosha, is ityootrue that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it?”yooyoo“I don’t know.”yooyoo“There’s a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew, who took ayoochild of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands, and thenyoocrucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him and crucified him, andyooafterwards, when he was tried, he said that the child died soon, withinyoofour hours. That was ‘soon’! He said the child moaned, kept on moaning andyoohe stood admiring it. That’s nice!”yooyoo“Nice?”yooyoo“Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him. He would hangyoothere moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple _compote_. Iyooam awfully fond of pineapple _compote_. Do you like it?”yooyooAlyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was suddenlyyoocontorted, her eyes burned.yooyoo“You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night. I keptyoofancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a child of four years oldyoounderstands, you know), and all the while the thought of pineappleyoo_compote_ haunted me. In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person,yoobegging him _particularly_ to come and see me. He came and I suddenly toldyoohim all about the child and the pineapple _compote_. _All_ about it,yoo_all_, and said that it was nice. He laughed and said it really was nice.yooThen he got up and went away. He was only here five minutes. Did heyoodespise me? Did he despise me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he despiseyoome or not?” She sat up on the couch, with flashing eyes.yooyoo“Tell me,” Alyosha asked anxiously, “did you send for that person?”yooyoo“Yes, I did.”yooyoo“Did you send him a letter?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Simply to ask about that, about that child?”yooyoo“No, not about that at all. But when he came, I asked him about that atyooonce. He answered, laughed, got up and went away.”yooyoo“That person behaved honorably,” Alyosha murmured.yooyoo“And did he despise me? Did he laugh at me?”yooyoo“No, for perhaps he believes in the pineapple _compote_ himself. He isyoovery ill now, too, Lise.”yooyoo“Yes, he does believe in it,” said Lise, with flashing eyes.yooyoo“He doesn’t despise any one,” Alyosha went on. “Only he does not believeyooany one. If he doesn’t believe in people, of course, he does despiseyoothem.”yooyoo“Then he despises me, me?”yooyoo“You, too.”yooyoo“Good,” Lise seemed to grind her teeth. “When he went out laughing, I feltyoothat it was nice to be despised. The child with fingers cut off is nice,yooand to be despised is nice....”yooyooAnd she laughed in Alyosha’s face, a feverish malicious laugh.yooyoo“Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like—Alyosha, save me!” Sheyoosuddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and seized him with bothyoohands. “Save me!” she almost groaned. “Is there any one in the world Iyoocould tell what I’ve told you? I’ve told you the truth, the truth. I shallyookill myself, because I loathe everything! I don’t want to live, because Iyooloathe everything! I loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don’t youyoolove me in the least?” she finished in a frenzy.yooyoo“But I do love you!” answered Alyosha warmly.yooyoo“And will you weep over me, will you?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Not because I won’t be your wife, but simply weep for me?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“Thank you! It’s only your tears I want. Every one else may punish me andyootrample me under foot, every one, every one, not excepting _any one_. ForyooI don’t love any one. Do you hear, not any one! On the contrary, I hateyoohim! Go, Alyosha; it’s time you went to your brother”; she tore herselfyooaway from him suddenly.yooyoo“How can I leave you like this?” said Alyosha, almost in alarm.yooyoo“Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here’s your hat. Give myyoolove to Mitya, go, go!”yooyooAnd she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He looked at heryoowith pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his rightyoohand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed. He glanced at it andyooinstantly read the address, “To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov.” He lookedyooquickly at Lise. Her face had become almost menacing.yooyoo“Give it to him, you must give it to him!” she ordered him, trembling andyoobeside herself. “To-day, at once, or I’ll poison myself! That’s why I sentyoofor you.”yooyooAnd she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha put the noteyooin his pocket and went straight downstairs, without going back to MadameyooHohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon as Alyosha had gone, Liseyoounbolted the door, opened it a little, put her finger in the crack andyooslammed the door with all her might, pinching her finger. Ten secondsyooafter, releasing her finger, she walked softly, slowly to her chair, satyooup straight in it and looked intently at her blackened finger and at theyooblood that oozed from under the nail. Her lips were quivering and she keptyoowhispering rapidly to herself:yooyoo“I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!”yooyooyooyooChapter IV. A Hymn And A SecretyooyooyooIt was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha rang at theyooprison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But Alyosha knew that he wouldyoobe admitted without difficulty. Things were managed in our little town, asyooeverywhere else. At first, of course, on the conclusion of the preliminaryyooinquiry, relations and a few other persons could only obtain interviewsyoowith Mitya by going through certain inevitable formalities. But later,yoothough the formalities were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, atyooleast, of Mitya’s visitors. So much so, that sometimes the interviews withyoothe prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practicallyyoo_tête-à-tête_.yooyooThese exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka, Alyosha andyooRakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the police, MihailyooMihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka. His abuse of heryooat Mokroe weighed on the old man’s conscience, and when he learned theyoowhole story, he completely changed his view of her. And strange to say,yoothough he was firmly persuaded of his guilt, yet after Mitya was once inyooprison, the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him. “Heyoowas a man of good heart, perhaps,” he thought, “who had come to grief fromyoodrinking and dissipation.” His first horror had been succeeded by pity. Asyoofor Alyosha, the police captain was very fond of him and had known him foryooa long time. Rakitin, who had of late taken to coming very often to seeyoothe prisoner, was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the “policeyoocaptain’s young ladies,” as he called them, and was always hanging aboutyootheir house. He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent,yootoo, who, though scrupulous in the performance of his duties, was ayookind-hearted old man. Alyosha, again, had an intimate acquaintance of longyoostanding with the superintendent, who was fond of talking to him,yoogenerally on sacred subjects. He respected Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood inyooawe of his opinion, though he was a great philosopher himself;yoo“self-taught,” of course. But Alyosha had an irresistible attraction foryoohim. During the last year the old man had taken to studying the ApocryphalyooGospels, and constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend.yooHe used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hoursyootogether with him and with the monks. So even if Alyosha were late at theyooprison, he had only to go to the superintendent and everything was madeyooeasy. Besides, every one in the prison, down to the humblest warder, hadyoogrown used to Alyosha. The sentry, of course, did not trouble him so longyooas the authorities were satisfied.yooyooWhen Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went downstairs, to theyooplace set aside for interviews. As Alyosha entered the room he came uponyooRakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya. They were both talkingyooloudly. Mitya was laughing heartily as he saw him out, while Rakitinyooseemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha, especially ofyoolate. He scarcely spoke to him, and bowed to him stiffly. Seeing Alyoshayooenter now, he frowned and looked away, as though he were entirely absorbedyooin buttoning his big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat. Then he began looking atyooonce for his umbrella.yooyoo“I must mind not to forget my belongings,” he muttered, simply to sayyoosomething.yooyoo“Mind you don’t forget other people’s belongings,” said Mitya, as a joke,yooand laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up instantly.yooyoo“You’d better give that advice to your own family, who’ve always been ayooslave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin,” he cried, suddenly trembling withyooanger.yooyoo“What’s the matter? I was joking,” cried Mitya. “Damn it all! They are allyoolike that,” he turned to Alyosha, nodding towards Rakitin’s hurriedlyyooretreating figure. “He was sitting here, laughing and cheerful, and all atyooonce he boils up like that. He didn’t even nod to you. Have you brokenyoowith him completely? Why are you so late? I’ve not been simply waiting,yoobut thirsting for you the whole morning. But never mind. We’ll make up foryooit now.”yooyoo“Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great friends?”yooasked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through which Rakitin hadyoodisappeared.yooyoo“Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it likely—a pigyoolike that? He considers I am ... a blackguard. They can’t understand ayoojoke either, that’s the worst of such people. They never understand ayoojoke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat; they remind me of prisonyoowalls when I was first brought here. But he is a clever fellow, veryyooclever. Well, Alexey, it’s all over with me now.”yooyooHe sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him.yooyoo“Yes, the trial’s to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?” Alyosha said,yoowith an apprehensive feeling.yooyoo“What are you talking about?” said Mitya, looking at him ratheryoouncertainly. “Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we’ve beenyootalking of things that don’t matter, about this trial, but I haven’t saidyooa word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to-morrow; but ityoowasn’t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do youyoolook at me so critically?”yooyoo“What do you mean, Mitya?”yooyoo“Ideas, ideas, that’s all! Ethics! What is ethics?”yooyoo“Ethics?” asked Alyosha, wondering.yooyoo“Yes; is it a science?”yooyoo“Yes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can’t explain to youyoowhat sort of science it is.”yooyoo“Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He’s not going to be ayoomonk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he’ll go in for criticism of anyooelevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career,yootoo. Ough! they are first-rate, these people, at making a career! Damnyooethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more thanyooany one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?”yooyoo“Karl Bernard?” Alyosha was surprised again.yooyoo“No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was he?yooChemist or what?”yooyoo“He must be a savant,” answered Alyosha; “but I confess I can’t tell youyoomuch about him, either. I’ve heard of him as a savant, but what sort Iyoodon’t know.”yooyoo“Well, damn him, then! I don’t know either,” swore Mitya. “A scoundrel ofyoosome sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels. And Rakitin will make hisyooway. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he is another Bernard. Ugh, theseyooBernards! They are all over the place.”yooyoo“But what is the matter?” Alyosha asked insistently.yooyoo“He wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so begin hisyooliterary career. That’s what he comes for; he said so himself. He wants toyooprove some theory. He wants to say ‘he couldn’t help murdering his father,yoohe was corrupted by his environment,’ and so on. He explained it all toyoome. He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But there, damnyoothe fellow, he can put in a tinge if he likes, I don’t care. He can’t bearyooIvan, he hates him. He’s not fond of you, either. But I don’t turn himyooout, for he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited, though. I said to himyoojust now, ‘The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosophers; for allyootrue Russians are philosophers, and though you’ve studied, you are not ayoophilosopher—you are a low fellow.’ He laughed, so maliciously. And I saidyooto him, ‘_De ideabus non est disputandum_.’ Isn’t that rather good? I canyooset up for being a classic, you see!” Mitya laughed suddenly.yooyoo“Why is it all over with you? You said so just now,” Alyosha interposed.yooyoo“Why is it all over with me? H’m!... The fact of it is ... if you take ityooas a whole, I am sorry to lose God—that’s why it is.”yooyoo“What do you mean by ‘sorry to lose God’?”yooyoo“Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in the head—that is, these nerves areyoothere in the brain ... (damn them!) there are sort of little tails, theyoolittle tails of those nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering ... thatyoois, you see, I look at something with my eyes and then they beginyooquivering, those little tails ... and when they quiver, then an imageyooappears ... it doesn’t appear at once, but an instant, a second, passesyoo... and then something like a moment appears; that is, not a moment—devilyootake the moment!—but an image; that is, an object, or an action, damn it!yooThat’s why I see and then think, because of those tails, not at allyoobecause I’ve got a soul, and that I am some sort of image and likeness.yooAll that is nonsense! Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, brother,yooand it simply bowled me over. It’s magnificent, Alyosha, this science! Ayoonew man’s arising—that I understand.... And yet I am sorry to lose God!”yooyoo“Well, that’s a good thing, anyway,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“That I am sorry to lose God? It’s chemistry, brother, chemistry! There’syoono help for it, your reverence, you must make way for chemistry. AndyooRakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesn’t he dislike Him! That’s the soreyoopoint with all of them. But they conceal it. They tell lies. They pretend.yoo‘Will you preach this in your reviews?’ I asked him. ‘Oh, well, if I didyooit openly, they won’t let it through,’ he said. He laughed. ‘But what willyoobecome of men then?’ I asked him, ‘without God and immortal life? Allyoothings are lawful then, they can do what they like?’ ‘Didn’t you know?’ heyoosaid laughing, ‘a clever man can do what he likes,’ he said. ‘A clever manyooknows his way about, but you’ve put your foot in it, committing a murder,yooand now you are rotting in prison.’ He says that to my face! A regularyoopig! I used to kick such people out, but now I listen to them. He talks ayoolot of sense, too. Writes well. He began reading me an article last week.yooI copied out three lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.”yooyooMitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read:yooyoo“ ‘In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to putyooone’s personality in contradiction to one’s reality.’ Do you understandyoothat?”yooyoo“No, I don’t,” said Alyosha. He looked at Mitya and listened to him withyoocuriosity.yooyoo“I don’t understand either. It’s dark and obscure, but intellectual.yoo‘Every one writes like that now,’ he says, ‘it’s the effect of theiryooenvironment.’ They are afraid of the environment. He writes poetry, too,yoothe rascal. He’s written in honor of Madame Hohlakov’s foot. Ha ha ha!”yooyoo“I’ve heard about it,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“Have you? And have you heard the poem?”yooyoo“No.”yooyoo“I’ve got it. Here it is. I’ll read it to you. You don’t know—I haven’tyootold you—there’s quite a story about it. He’s a rascal! Three weeks ago heyoobegan to tease me. ‘You’ve got yourself into a mess, like a fool, for theyoosake of three thousand, but I’m going to collar a hundred and fiftyyoothousand. I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg.’ Andyoohe told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov. She hadn’t much brains in heryooyouth, and now at forty she has lost what she had. ‘But she’s awfullyyoosentimental,’ he says; ‘that’s how I shall get hold of her. When I marryyooher, I shall take her to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.’yooAnd his mouth was simply watering, the beast, not for the widow, but foryoothe hundred and fifty thousand. And he made me believe it. He came to seeyoome every day. ‘She is coming round,’ he declared. He was beaming withyoodelight. And then, all of a sudden, he was turned out of the house.yooPerhotin’s carrying everything before him, bravo! I could kiss the sillyyooold noodle for turning him out of the house. And he had written thisyoodoggerel. ‘It’s the first time I’ve soiled my hands with writing poetry,’yoohe said. ‘It’s to win her heart, so it’s in a good cause. When I get holdyooof the silly woman’s fortune, I can be of great social utility.’ They haveyoothis social justification for every nasty thing they do! ‘Anyway it’syoobetter than your Pushkin’s poetry,’ he said, ‘for I’ve managed to advocateyooenlightenment even in that.’ I understand what he means about Pushkin, Iyooquite see that, if he really was a man of talent and only wrote aboutyoowomen’s feet. But wasn’t Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel! The vanityyooof these fellows! ‘On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the objectyooof my affections’—he thought of that for a title. He’s a waggish fellow.yooyooyoo    A captivating little foot,yoo    Though swollen and red and tender!yoo    The doctors come and plasters put,yoo    But still they cannot mend her.yooyoo    Yet, ’tis not for her foot I dread—yoo    A theme for Pushkin’s muse more fit—yoo    It’s not her foot, it is her head:yoo    I tremble for her loss of wit!yooyoo    For as her foot swells, strange to say,yoo    Her intellect is on the wane—yoo    Oh, for some remedy I prayyoo    That may restore both foot and brain!yooyooyooHe is a pig, a regular pig, but he’s very arch, the rascal! And he reallyyoohas put in a progressive idea. And wasn’t he angry when she kicked himyooout! He was gnashing his teeth!”yooyoo“He’s taken his revenge already,” said Alyosha. “He’s written a paragraphyooabout Madame Hohlakov.”yooyooAnd Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in _Gossip_.yooyoo“That’s his doing, that’s his doing!” Mitya assented, frowning. “That’syoohim! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have beenyoowritten about Grushenka, for instance.... And about Katya, too.... H’m!”yooyooHe walked across the room with a harassed air.yooyoo“Brother, I cannot stay long,” Alyosha said, after a pause. “To-morrowyoowill be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will beyooaccomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of Iyoodon’t know what ...”yooyoo“No, don’t be amazed at me,” Mitya broke in warmly. “Am I to talk of thatyoostinking dog? Of the murderer? We’ve talked enough of him. I don’t want toyoosay more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, youyoowill see. Hush!”yooyooHe went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes glowed.yooyoo“Rakitin wouldn’t understand it,” he began in a sort of exaltation; “butyooyou, you’ll understand it all. That’s why I was thirsting for you. Youyoosee, there’s so much I’ve been wanting to tell you for ever so long, here,yoowithin these peeling walls, but I haven’t said a word about what mattersyoomost; the moment never seems to have come. Now I can wait no longer. Iyoomust pour out my heart to you. Brother, these last two months I’ve foundyooin myself a new man. A new man has risen up in me. He was hidden in me,yoobut would never have come to the surface, if it hadn’t been for this blowyoofrom heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care if I spend twenty years inyoothe mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am not a bit afraid of that—it’syoosomething else I am afraid of now: that that new man may leave me. Evenyoothere, in the mines, under-ground, I may find a human heart in anotheryooconvict and murderer by my side, and I may make friends with him, for evenyoothere one may live and love and suffer. One may thaw and revive a frozenyooheart in that convict, one may wait upon him for years, and at last bringyooup from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; oneyoomay bring forth an angel, create a hero! There are so many of them,yoohundreds of them, and we are all to blame for them. Why was it I dreamedyooof that ‘babe’ at such a moment? ‘Why is the babe so poor?’ That was ayoosign to me at that moment. It’s for the babe I’m going. Because we are allyooresponsible for all. For all the ‘babes,’ for there are big children asyoowell as little children. All are ‘babes.’ I go for all, because some oneyoomust go for all. I didn’t kill father, but I’ve got to go. I accept it.yooIt’s all come to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There areyoonumbers of them there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in theiryoohands. Oh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom, butyoothen, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without which manyoocannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy: it’s His privilege—a grandyooone. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer! What should I be undergroundyoothere without God? Rakitin’s laughing! If they drive God from the earth,yoowe shall shelter Him underground. One cannot exist in prison without God;yooit’s even more impossible than out of prison. And then we men undergroundyoowill sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to God, with Whomyoois joy. Hail to God and His joy! I love Him!”yooyooMitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech. Heyooturned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.yooyoo“Yes, life is full, there is life even underground,” he began again. “Youyoowouldn’t believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a thirst foryooexistence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these peelingyoowalls. Rakitin doesn’t understand that; all he cares about is building ayoohouse and letting flats. But I’ve been longing for you. And what isyoosuffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it were beyond reckoning. I amyoonot afraid of it now. I was afraid of it before. Do you know, perhaps Iyoowon’t answer at the trial at all.... And I seem to have such strength inyoome now, that I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to beyooable to say and to repeat to myself every moment, ‘I exist.’ In thousandsyooof agonies—I exist. I’m tormented on the rack—but I exist! Though I sityooalone on a pillar—I exist! I see the sun, and if I don’t see the sun, Iyooknow it’s there. And there’s a whole life in that, in knowing that the sunyoois there. Alyosha, my angel, all these philosophies are the death of me.yooDamn them! Brother Ivan—”yooyoo“What of brother Ivan?” interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did not hear.yooyoo“You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all hiddenyooaway in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand wereyoosurging up in me, that I used to drink and fight and rage. It was toyoostifle them in myself, to still them, to smother them. Ivan is notyooRakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is a sphinx and is silent; he isyooalways silent. It’s God that’s worrying me. That’s the only thing that’syooworrying me. What if He doesn’t exist? What if Rakitin’s right—that it’syooan idea made up by men? Then if He doesn’t exist, man is the chief of theyooearth, of the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he going to be goodyoowithout God? That’s the question. I always come back to that. For whom isyooman going to love then? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will he singyoothe hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love humanity withoutyooGod. Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that. I can’t understandyooit. Life’s easy for Rakitin. ‘You’d better think about the extension ofyoocivic rights, or even of keeping down the price of meat. You will showyooyour love for humanity more simply and directly by that, than byyoophilosophy.’ I answered him, ‘Well, but you, without a God, are moreyoolikely to raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble onyooevery copeck.’ He lost his temper. But after all, what is goodness? Answeryoome that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another with ayooChinaman, so it’s a relative thing. Or isn’t it? Is it not relative? Ayootreacherous question! You won’t laugh if I tell you it’s kept me awake twoyoonights. I only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it.yooVanity! Ivan has no God. He has an idea. It’s beyond me. But he is silent.yooI believe he is a free-mason. I asked him, but he is silent. I wanted toyoodrink from the springs of his soul—he was silent. But once he did drop ayooword.”yooyoo“What did he say?” Alyosha took it up quickly.yooyoo“I said to him, ‘Then everything is lawful, if it is so?’ He frowned.yoo‘Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,’ he said, ‘was a pig, but his ideas wereyooright enough.’ That was what he dropped. That was all he said. That wasyoogoing one better than Rakitin.”yooyoo“Yes,” Alyosha assented bitterly. “When was he with you?”yooyoo“Of that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said nothingyooabout Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When my business hereyoois over and the verdict has been given, then I’ll tell you something. I’llyootell you everything. We’ve something tremendous on hand.... And you shallyoobe my judge in it. But don’t begin about that now; be silent. You talk ofyooto-morrow, of the trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing aboutyooit.”yooyoo“Have you talked to the counsel?”yooyoo“What’s the use of the counsel? I told him all about it. He’s a soft,yoocity-bred rogue—a Bernard! But he doesn’t believe me—not a bit of it. Onlyyooimagine, he believes I did it. I see it. ‘In that case,’ I asked him, ‘whyyoohave you come to defend me?’ Hang them all! They’ve got a doctor down,yootoo, want to prove I’m mad. I won’t have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants toyoodo her ‘duty’ to the end, whatever the strain!” Mitya smiled bitterly.yoo“The cat! Hard-hearted creature! She knows that I said of her at Mokroeyoothat she was a woman of ‘great wrath.’ They repeated it. Yes, the factsyooagainst me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea. Grigory sticks toyoohis point. Grigory’s honest, but a fool. Many people are honest becauseyoothey are fools: that’s Rakitin’s idea. Grigory’s my enemy. And there areyoosome people who are better as foes than friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna.yooI am afraid, oh, I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the groundyooafter that four thousand. She’ll pay it back to the last farthing. I don’tyoowant her sacrifice; they’ll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how Iyoocan stand it. Go to her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in theyoocourt, can’t you? But damn it all, it doesn’t matter! I shall get throughyoosomehow. I don’t pity her. It’s her own doing. She deserves what she gets.yooI shall have my own story to tell, Alexey.” He smiled bitterly again.yoo“Only ... only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why should she have suchyoosuffering to bear?” he exclaimed suddenly, with tears. “Grusha’s killingyoome; the thought of her’s killing me, killing me. She was with me justyoonow....”yooyoo“She told me she was very much grieved by you to-day.”yooyoo“I know. Confound my temper! It was jealousy. I was sorry, I kissed her asyooshe was going. I didn’t ask her forgiveness.”yooyoo“Why didn’t you?” exclaimed Alyosha.yooyooSuddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.yooyoo“God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness for a faultyoofrom a woman you love. From one you love especially, however greatly youyoomay have been in fault. For a woman—devil only knows what to make of ayoowoman! I know something about them, anyway. But try acknowledging you areyooin fault to a woman. Say, ‘I am sorry, forgive me,’ and a shower ofyooreproaches will follow! Nothing will make her forgive you simply andyoodirectly, she’ll humble you to the dust, bring forward things that haveyoonever happened, recall everything, forget nothing, add something of heryooown, and only then forgive you. And even the best, the best of them do it.yooShe’ll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head. They areyooready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all these angelsyoowithout whom we cannot live! I tell you plainly and openly, dear boy,yooevery decent man ought to be under some woman’s thumb. That’s myyooconviction—not conviction, but feeling. A man ought to be magnanimous, andyooit’s no disgrace to a man! No disgrace to a hero, not even a Cæsar! Butyoodon’t ever beg her pardon all the same for anything. Remember that ruleyoogiven you by your brother Mitya, who’s come to ruin through women. No, I’dyoobetter make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I worshipyooher, Alexey, worship her. Only she doesn’t see it. No, she still thinks Iyoodon’t love her enough. And she tortures me, tortures me with her love. Theyoopast was nothing! In the past it was only those infernal curves of hersyoothat tortured me, but now I’ve taken all her soul into my soul and throughyooher I’ve become a man myself. Will they marry us? If they don’t, I shallyoodie of jealousy. I imagine something every day.... What did she say to youyooabout me?”yooyooAlyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya listened,yoomade him repeat things, and seemed pleased.yooyoo“Then she is not angry at my being jealous?” he exclaimed. “She is ayooregular woman! ‘I’ve a fierce heart myself!’ Ah, I love such fierceyoohearts, though I can’t bear any one’s being jealous of me. I can’t endureyooit. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her infinitely.yooWill they marry us? Do they let convicts marry? That’s the question. Andyoowithout her I can’t exist....”yooyooMitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark. He suddenlyyooseemed terribly worried.yooyoo“So there’s a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot againstyooher, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good Grushenka,yoothat’s not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your foolish feminineyooway. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I’ll tell you our secret!”yooyooHe looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing beforeyoohim, and whispered to him with an air of mystery, though in reality no oneyoocould hear them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a wordyoocould reach the ears of the soldiers on guard.yooyoo“I will tell you all our secret,” Mitya whispered hurriedly. “I meant toyootell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you? You areyooeverything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are myyooangel. It’s your decision will decide it. Perhaps it’s you that isyoosuperior and not Ivan. You see, it’s a question of conscience, question ofyoothe higher conscience—the secret is so important that I can’t settle ityoomyself, and I’ve put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway it’s tooyooearly to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon as theyooverdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Don’t decide it now. I’ll tellyooyou now. You listen, but don’t decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won’t tellyooyou everything. I’ll only tell you the idea, without details, and you keepyooquiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, whatyooshall I do with your eyes? I’m afraid your eyes will tell me youryoodecision, even if you don’t speak. Oo! I’m afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivanyoosuggests my _escaping_. I won’t tell you the details: it’s all beenyoothought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don’t decide. I should go toyooAmerica with Grusha. You know I can’t live without Grusha! What if theyyoowon’t let her follow me to Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivanyoothinks not. And without Grusha what should I do there underground with ayoohammer? I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the otheryoohand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering. A sign hasyoocome, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back onyooit. Ivan says that in America, ‘with the good-will,’ I can be of more useyoothan underground. But what becomes of our hymn from underground? What’syooAmerica? America is vanity again! And there’s a lot of swindling inyooAmerica, too, I expect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I tellyooyou, you know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can understandyoothis. There’s no one else. It’s folly, madness to others, all I’ve toldyooyou of the hymn. They’ll say I’m out of my mind or a fool. I am not out ofyoomy mind and I am not a fool. Ivan understands about the hymn, too. Heyoounderstands, only he doesn’t answer—he doesn’t speak. He doesn’t believeyooin the hymn. Don’t speak, don’t speak. I see how you look! You haveyooalready decided. Don’t decide, spare me! I can’t live without Grusha. Waityootill after the trial!”yooyooMitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with both hands on hisyooshoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his brother’s.yooyoo“They don’t let convicts marry, do they?” he repeated for the third timeyooin a supplicating voice.yooyooAlyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.yooyoo“Tell me one thing,” he said. “Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose idea wasyooit?”yooyoo“His, his, and he is very keen on it. He didn’t come to see me at first,yoothen he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away. Heyoois awfully keen on it. He doesn’t ask me, but orders me to escape. Heyoodoesn’t doubt of my obeying him, though I showed him all my heart as Iyoohave to you, and told him about the hymn, too. He told me he’d arrange it;yoohe’s found out about everything. But of that later. He’s simply set on it.yooIt’s all a matter of money: he’ll pay ten thousand for escape and give meyootwenty thousand for America. And he says we can arrange a magnificentyooescape for ten thousand.”yooyoo“And he told you on no account to tell me?” Alyosha asked again.yooyoo“To tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you. He isyooafraid, no doubt, that you’ll stand before me as my conscience. Don’t tellyoohim I told you. Don’t tell him, for anything.”yooyoo“You are right,” Alyosha pronounced; “it’s impossible to decide anythingyoobefore the trial is over. After the trial you’ll decide of yourself. Thenyooyou’ll find that new man in yourself and he will decide.”yooyoo“A new man, or a Bernard who’ll decide _à la_ Bernard, for I believe I’m ayoocontemptible Bernard myself,” said Mitya, with a bitter grin.yooyoo“But, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?”yooyooMitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head. “Alyosha,yoodarling, it’s time you were going,” he said, with a sudden haste. “There’syoothe superintendent shouting in the yard. He’ll be here directly. We areyoolate; it’s irregular. Embrace me quickly. Kiss me! Sign me with the cross,yoodarling, for the cross I have to bear to-morrow.”yooyooThey embraced and kissed.yooyoo“Ivan,” said Mitya suddenly, “suggests my escaping; but, of course, heyoobelieves I did it.”yooyooA mournful smile came on to his lips.yooyoo“Have you asked him whether he believes it?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“No, I haven’t. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. I hadn’t the courage. But Iyoosaw it from his eyes. Well, good-by!”yooyooOnce more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out, whenyooMitya suddenly called him back.yooyoo“Stand facing me! That’s right!” And again he seized Alyosha, putting bothyoohands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so that ityoowas dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness. His lipsyootwitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha.yooyoo“Alyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do you believeyooI did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole truth, don’tyoolie!” he cried desperately.yooyooEverything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something like ayoostab at his heart.yooyoo“Hush! What do you mean?” he faltered helplessly.yooyoo“The whole truth, the whole, don’t lie!” repeated Mitya.yooyoo“I’ve never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!” broke inyooa shaking voice from Alyosha’s breast, and he raised his right hand in theyooair, as though calling God to witness his words.yooyooMitya’s whole face was lighted up with bliss.yooyoo“Thank you!” he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape himyooafter fainting. “Now you have given me new life. Would you believe it,yootill this moment I’ve been afraid to ask you, you, even you. Well, go!yooYou’ve given me strength for to-morrow. God bless you! Come, go along!yooLove Ivan!” was Mitya’s last word.yooyooAlyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack ofyooconfidence even to him, to Alyosha—all this suddenly opened before Alyoshayooan unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of hisyoounhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly.yooThere was a poignant ache in his torn heart. “Love Ivan!”—he suddenlyyoorecalled Mitya’s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to seeyooIvan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and moreyoothan ever now.yooyooyooyooChapter V. Not You, Not You!yooyooyooOn the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna wasyooliving. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolvedyooto go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But nowyooit struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of theyooterrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lightedyooby a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, heyoorecognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from KaterinayooIvanovna.yooyoo“Ah, it’s only you,” said Ivan dryly. “Well, good-by! You are going toyooher?”yooyoo“Yes.”yooyoo“I don’t advise you to; she’s upset and you’ll upset her more.”yooyooA door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly:yooyoo“No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?”yooyoo“Yes, I have been with him.”yooyoo“Has he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan Fyodorovitch,yooyou must come back, you must. Do you hear?”yooyooThere was such a peremptory note in Katya’s voice that Ivan, after ayoomoment’s hesitation, made up his mind to go back with Alyosha.yooyoo“She was listening,” he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha heard it.yooyoo“Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on,” said Ivan, going into theyoodrawing-room. “I won’t sit down. I won’t stay more than a minute.”yooyoo“Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” said Katerina Ivanovna, though sheyooremained standing. She had changed very little during this time, but thereyoowas an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered afterwards thatyooshe had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment.yooyoo“What did he ask you to tell me?”yooyoo“Only one thing,” said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face, “thatyooyou would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what” (he was ayoolittle confused) “... passed between you ... at the time of your firstyooacquaintance ... in that town.”yooyoo“Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!” She broke into ayoobitter laugh. “Why, is he afraid for me or for himself? He asks me toyoospare—whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey Fyodorovitch!”yooyooAlyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.yooyoo“Both yourself and him,” he answered softly.yooyoo“I am glad to hear it,” she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenlyyooblushed.yooyoo“You don’t know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she said menacingly. “And Iyoodon’t know myself yet. Perhaps you’ll want to trample me under foot afteryoomy examination to-morrow.”yooyoo“You will give your evidence honorably,” said Alyosha; “that’s all that’syoowanted.”yooyoo“Women are often dishonorable,” she snarled. “Only an hour ago I wasyoothinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were ayooreptile ... but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he do it? Isyoohe the murderer?” she cried, all of a sudden, hysterically, turningyooquickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that questionyoobefore, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for the firstyootime, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling.yooyoo“I’ve been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that heyoomurdered his father. It’s only you I believed!” she continued, stillyooaddressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started atyooher tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them.yooyoo“Well, that’s enough, anyway,” Ivan cut short the conversation. “I amyoogoing. I’ll come to-morrow.” And turning at once, he walked out of theyooroom and went straight downstairs.yooyooWith an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands.yooyoo“Follow him! Overtake him! Don’t leave him alone for a minute!” she said,yooin a hurried whisper. “He’s mad! Don’t you know that he’s mad? He is in ayoofever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so. Go, run after him....”yooyooAlyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead ofyoohim.yooyoo“What do you want?” He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he wasyoorunning after him. “She told you to catch me up, because I’m mad. I knowyooit all by heart,” he added irritably.yooyoo“She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,” saidyooAlyosha. “I was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.”yooyooIvan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him.yooyoo“And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of theiryoomind?” Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace ofyooirritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.yooyoo“No, I don’t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.”yooyoo“And can one observe that one’s going mad oneself?”yooyoo“I imagine one can’t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,” Alyoshayooanswered with surprise.yooyooIvan paused for half a minute.yooyoo“If you want to talk to me, please change the subject,” he said suddenly.yooyoo“Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,” said Alyosha timidly,yooand he took Lise’s note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan. They wereyoojust under a lamp-post. Ivan recognized the handwriting at once.yooyoo“Ah, from that little demon!” he laughed maliciously, and, without openingyoothe envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The bits wereyooscattered by the wind.yooyoo“She’s not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,” he saidyoocontemptuously, striding along the street again.yooyoo“How do you mean, offering herself?” exclaimed Alyosha.yooyoo“As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.”yooyoo“How can you, Ivan, how can you?” Alyosha cried warmly, in a grievedyoovoice. “She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is ill; she is veryyooill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps.... I had hoped toyoohear something from you ... that would save her.”yooyoo“You’ll hear nothing from me. If she is a child I am not her nurse. Beyooquiet, Alexey. Don’t go on about her. I am not even thinking about it.”yooyooThey were silent again for a moment.yooyoo“She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her how toyooact to-morrow at the trial,” he said sharply and angrily again.yooyoo“You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?”yooyoo“Yes. Whether she’s to save Mitya or ruin him. She’ll pray for light fromyooabove. She can’t make up her mind for herself, you see. She has not hadyootime to decide yet. She takes me for her nurse, too. She wants me to singyoolullabies to her.”yooyoo“Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother,” said Alyosha sadly.yooyoo“Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her.”yooyoo“She is suffering. Why do you ... sometimes say things to her that giveyooher hope?” Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. “I know that you’ve givenyooher hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,” he added.yooyoo“I can’t behave to her as I ought—break off altogether and tell her soyoostraight out,” said Ivan, irritably. “I must wait till sentence is passedyooon the murderer. If I break off with her now, she will avenge herself onyoome by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the trial, for she hates him andyooknows she hates him. It’s all a lie—lie upon lie! As long as I don’t breakyoooff with her, she goes on hoping, and she won’t ruin that monster, knowingyoohow I want to get him out of trouble. If only that damned verdict wouldyoocome!”yooyooThe words “murderer” and “monster” echoed painfully in Alyosha’s heart.yooyoo“But how can she ruin Mitya?” he asked, pondering on Ivan’s words. “Whatyooevidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?”yooyoo“You don’t know that yet. She’s got a document in her hands, in Mitya’syooown writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder FyodoryooPavlovitch.”yooyoo“That’s impossible!” cried Alyosha.yooyoo“Why is it impossible? I’ve read it myself.”yooyoo“There can’t be such a document!” Alyosha repeated warmly. “There can’tyoobe, because he’s not the murderer. It’s not he murdered father, not he!”yooyooIvan suddenly stopped.yooyoo“Who is the murderer then, according to you?” he asked, with apparentyoocoldness. There was even a supercilious note in his voice.yooyoo“You know who,” Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating voice.yooyoo“Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic,yooSmerdyakov?”yooyooAlyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.yooyoo“You know who,” broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely breathe.yooyoo“Who? Who?” Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint suddenlyyoovanished.yooyoo“I only know one thing,” Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper, “_ityoowasn’t you_ killed father.”yooyoo“ ‘Not you’! What do you mean by ‘not you’?” Ivan was thunderstruck.yooyoo“It was not you killed father, not you!” Alyosha repeated firmly.yooyooThe silence lasted for half a minute.yooyoo“I know I didn’t. Are you raving?” said Ivan, with a pale, distortedyoosmile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing again under ayoolamp-post.yooyoo“No, Ivan. You’ve told yourself several times that you are the murderer.”yooyoo“When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said so?” Ivanyoofaltered helplessly.yooyoo“You’ve said so to yourself many times, when you’ve been alone duringyoothese two dreadful months,” Alyosha went on softly and distinctly asyoobefore. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of himself, not of hisyooown will, but obeying some irresistible command. “You have accusedyooyourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and noyooone else. But you didn’t do it: you are mistaken: you are not theyoomurderer. Do you hear? It was not you! God has sent me to tell you so.”yooyooThey were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute. They wereyooboth standing still, gazing into each other’s eyes. They were both pale.yooSuddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and clutched Alyosha’s shoulder.yooyoo“You’ve been in my room!” he whispered hoarsely. “You’ve been there atyoonight, when he came.... Confess ... have you seen him, have you seen him?”yooyoo“Whom do you mean—Mitya?” Alyosha asked, bewildered.yooyoo“Not him, damn the monster!” Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. “Do you know thatyoohe visits me? How did you find out? Speak!”yooyoo“Who is _he_! I don’t know whom you are talking about,” Alyosha faltered,yoobeginning to be alarmed.yooyoo“Yes, you do know ... or how could you—? It’s impossible that you don’tyooknow.”yooyooSuddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed to reflect.yooA strange grin contorted his lips.yooyoo“Brother,” Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, “I have said this toyooyou, because you’ll believe my word, I know that. I tell you once and foryooall, it’s not you. You hear, once for all! God has put it into my heart toyoosay this to you, even though it may make you hate me from this hour.”yooyooBut by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control.yooyoo“Alexey Fyodorovitch,” he said, with a cold smile, “I can’t endureyooprophets and epileptics—messengers from God especially—and you know thatyooonly too well. I break off all relations with you from this moment andyooprobably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this turning. It’s the way toyooyour lodgings, too. You’d better be particularly careful not to come to meyooto-day! Do you hear?”yooyooHe turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.yooyoo“Brother,” Alyosha called after him, “if anything happens to you to-day,yooturn to me before any one!”yooyooBut Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the crossyooroads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he turned and walkedyooslowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings; neitheryooof them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitch’s empty house. Alyoshayoohad a furnished room in the house of some working people. Ivan lived someyoodistance from him. He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodgeyooattached to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow ofyooan official. But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone whoyoowent to bed at six o’clock every evening and got up at six in the morning.yooIvan had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late, and veryyoofond of being alone. He did everything for himself in the one room heyoolived in, and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his abode.yooyooHe reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell, when heyoosuddenly stopped. He felt that he was trembling all over with anger.yooSuddenly he let go of the bell, turned back with a curse, and walked withyoorapid steps in the opposite direction. He walked a mile and a half to ayootiny, slanting, wooden house, almost a hut, where Marya Kondratyevna, theyooneighbor who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s kitchen for soup and toyoowhom Smerdyakov had once sung his songs and played on the guitar, was nowyoolodging. She had sold their little house, and was now living here with heryoomother. Smerdyakov, who was ill—almost dying—had been with them ever sinceyooFyodor Pavlovitch’s death. It was to him Ivan was going now, drawn by ayoosudden and irresistible prompting.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. The First Interview With SmerdyakovyooyooyooThis was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since hisyooreturn from Moscow. The first time he had seen him and talked to him wasyooon the first day of his arrival, then he had visited him once more, ayoofortnight later. But his visits had ended with that second one, so that ityoowas now over a month since he had seen him. And he had scarcely heardyooanything of him.yooyooIvan had only returned five days after his father’s death, so that he wasyoonot present at the funeral, which took place the day before he came back.yooThe cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing his Moscow address,yoohad to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him, and she, notyooknowing his address either, telegraphed to her sister and aunt, reckoningyooon Ivan’s going to see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow. But he didyoonot go to them till four days after his arrival. When he got the telegram,yoohe had, of course, set off post-haste to our town. The first to meet himyoowas Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition toyoothe general opinion of the town, he refused to entertain a suspicionyooagainst Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer. Later on,yooafter seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and hearing theyoodetails of the charge and the arrest, he was still more surprised atyooAlyosha, and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherlyyoofeeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was veryyoofond.yooyooBy the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan’s feeling to his brotheryooDmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes a compassionyoofor him, and even that was mixed with great contempt, almost repugnance.yooMitya’s whole personality, even his appearance, was extremely unattractiveyooto him. Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovna’s love for hisyoobrother. Yet he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, andyoothat interview, far from shaking Ivan’s belief in his guilt, positivelyyoostrengthened it. He found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mityayoohad been talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent. He used violentyoolanguage, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He talkedyooprincipally about the three thousand roubles, which he said had beenyoo“stolen” from him by his father.yooyoo“The money was mine, it was my money,” Mitya kept repeating. “Even if Iyoohad stolen it, I should have had the right.”yooyooHe hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to turn ayoofact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent way. He hardlyyooseemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any one else. Quite theyoocontrary, he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him; heyoowas continually firing up and abusing every one. He only laughedyoocontemptuously at Grigory’s evidence about the open door, and declaredyoothat it was “the devil that opened it.” But he could not bring forward anyyoocoherent explanation of the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivanyooduring their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not foryoopeople who declared that “everything was lawful,” to suspect and questionyoohim. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion.yooImmediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first timeyooto see Smerdyakov.yooyooIn the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking ofyooSmerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before heyoowent away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when heyoogave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for theyootime, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov,yoowho was at that time in the hospital.yooyooDoctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the hospital,yooconfidently asserted in reply to Ivan’s persistent questions, thatyooSmerdyakov’s epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were surprisedyooindeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the dayyooof the catastrophe. They gave him to understand that the attack was anyooexceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring several times, so thatyoothe patient’s life was positively in danger, and it was only now, afteryoothey had applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that theyoopatient would survive. “Though it might well be,” added DoctoryooHerzenstube, “that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period,yooif not permanently.” On Ivan’s asking impatiently whether that meant thatyoohe was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case, in the fullyoosense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were perceptible. Ivanyoodecided to find out for himself what those abnormalities were.yooyooAt the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov wasyoolying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward. There was only one other bed inyoothe room, and in it lay a tradesman of the town, swollen with dropsy, whoyoowas obviously almost dying; he could be no hindrance to theiryooconversation. Smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for theyoofirst instant seemed nervous. So at least Ivan fancied. But that was onlyyoomomentary. For the rest of the time he was struck, on the contrary, byyooSmerdyakov’s composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that heyoowas very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming to move hisyootongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and sallower. Throughout theyoointerview, which lasted twenty minutes, he kept complaining of headacheyooand of pain in all his limbs. His thin emasculate face seemed to haveyoobecome so tiny; his hair was ruffled, and his crest of curls in frontyoostood up in a thin tuft. But in the left eye, which was screwed up andyooseemed to be insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged.yoo“It’s always worth while speaking to a clever man.” Ivan was reminded ofyoothat at once. He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, withyoopainful effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first toyoospeak. He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested.yooyoo“Can you talk to me?” asked Ivan. “I won’t tire you much.”yooyoo“Certainly I can,” mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. “Has your honoryoobeen back long?” he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervousyoovisitor.yooyoo“I only arrived to-day.... To see the mess you are in here.” Smerdyakovyoosighed.yooyoo“Why do you sigh? You knew of it all along,” Ivan blurted out.yooyooSmerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.yooyoo“How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how could I tellyooit would turn out like that?”yooyoo“What would turn out? Don’t prevaricate! You’ve foretold you’d have a fit;yooon the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned the very spot.”yooyoo“Have you said so at the examination yet?” Smerdyakov queried withyoocomposure.yooyooIvan felt suddenly angry.yooyoo“No, I haven’t yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a great dealyooto me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let you play withyoome!”yooyoo“Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you, as in GodyooAlmighty?” said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only for a momentyooclosing his eyes.yooyoo“In the first place,” began Ivan, “I know that epileptic fits can’t beyootold beforehand. I’ve inquired; don’t try and take me in. You can’tyooforetell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the day and the houryoobeforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could you tell that you wouldyoofall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if you didn’t sham a fit onyoopurpose?”yooyoo“I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,”yooSmerdyakov drawled deliberately. “I fell from the garret just in the sameyooway a year ago. It’s quite true you can’t tell the day and hour of a fityoobeforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of it.”yooyoo“But you did foretell the day and the hour!”yooyoo“In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the doctorsyoohere. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham; it’s no use myyoosaying any more about it.”yooyoo“And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the cellar?”yooyoo“You don’t seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going down to theyoocellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened me most wasyoolosing you and being left without defense in all the world. So I went downyoointo the cellar thinking, ‘Here, it’ll come on directly, it’ll strike meyoodown directly, shall I fall?’ And it was through this fear that I suddenlyyoofelt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying. All that andyooall my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before, whenyooI told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all thatyooto Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer,yooand it’s all been written down in the protocol. And the doctor here, Mr.yooVarvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of ityoobrought it on, the apprehension that I might fall. It was just then thatyoothe fit seized me. And so they’ve written it down, that it’s just how ityoomust have happened, simply from my fear.”yooyooAs he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though exhausted.yooyoo“Then you have said all that in your evidence?” said Ivan, somewhat takenyooaback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating theiryooconversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it allyoohimself.yooyoo“What have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole truth,”yooSmerdyakov pronounced firmly.yooyoo“And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?”yooyoo“No, not to say every word.”yooyoo“And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?”yooyoo“No, I didn’t tell them that either.”yooyoo“Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?”yooyoo“I was afraid you’d go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.”yooyoo“You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to getyooout of the way of trouble.”yooyoo“That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you,yooforeseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to spareyoomyself even more. That’s why I told you to get out of harm’s way, that youyoomight understand that there would be trouble in the house, and wouldyooremain at home to protect your father.”yooyoo“You might have said it more directly, you blockhead!” Ivan suddenly firedyooup.yooyoo“How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my fear thatyoomade me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I might well have beenyooapprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry awayyoothat money, for he considered it as good as his own; but who could tellyoothat it would end in a murder like this? I thought that he would onlyyoocarry off the three thousand that lay under the master’s mattress in theyooenvelope, and you see, he’s murdered him. How could you guess it either,yoosir?”yooyoo“But if you say yourself that it couldn’t be guessed, how could I haveyooguessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!” said Ivan,yoopondering.yooyoo“You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not toyooMoscow.”yooyoo“How could I guess it from that?”yooyooSmerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for a minute.yooyoo“You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go toyooMoscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer, foryooMoscow’s a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you are not faryoooff, would not be so bold. And if anything had happened, you might haveyoocome to protect me, too, for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch’syooillness, and that I was afraid of having a fit. And when I explained thoseyooknocks to you, by means of which one could go in to the deceased, and thatyooDmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me, I thought that you wouldyooguess yourself that he would be sure to do something, and so wouldn’t goyooto Tchermashnya even, but would stay.”yooyoo“He talks very coherently,” thought Ivan, “though he does mumble; what’syoothe derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of?”yooyoo“You are cunning with me, damn you!” he exclaimed, getting angry.yooyoo“But I thought at the time that you quite guessed,” Smerdyakov parriedyoowith the simplest air.yooyoo“If I’d guessed, I should have stayed,” cried Ivan.yooyoo“Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went away inyoosuch a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away and saveyooyourself in your fright.”yooyoo“You think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?”yooyoo“Forgive me, I thought you were like me.”yooyoo“Of course, I ought to have guessed,” Ivan said in agitation; “and I didyooguess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying,yooyou are lying again,” he cried, suddenly recollecting. “Do you rememberyoohow you went up to the carriage and said to me, ‘It’s always worth whileyoospeaking to a clever man’? So you were glad I went away, since you praisedyoome?”yooyooSmerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into his face.yooyoo“If I was pleased,” he articulated rather breathlessly, “it was simplyyoobecause you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya. For it wasyoonearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it was not by way ofyoopraise, but of reproach. You didn’t understand it.”yooyoo“What reproach?”yooyoo“Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father, andyoowould not protect us, for I might have been taken up any time for stealingyoothat three thousand.”yooyoo“Damn you!” Ivan swore again. “Stay, did you tell the prosecutor and theyooinvestigating lawyer about those knocks?”yooyoo“I told them everything just as it was.”yooyooIvan wondered inwardly again.yooyoo“If I thought of anything then,” he began again, “it was solely of someyoowickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that he would steal—Iyoodid not believe that then.... But I was prepared for any wickedness fromyooyou. You told me yourself you could sham a fit. What did you say thatyoofor?”yooyoo“It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a fit onyoopurpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you. It was justyoofoolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open-hearted with you.”yooyoo“My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.”yooyoo“What else is left for him to do?” said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin.yoo“And who will believe him with all the proofs against him? GrigoryyooVassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after that? But neveryoomind him! He is trembling to save himself.”yooyooHe slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection, added:yooyoo“And look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out that it isyoothe work of my hands—I’ve heard that already. But as to my being clever atyooshamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one,yooif I really had had such a design against your father? If I had beenyooplanning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give suchyooevidence against myself beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Isyoothat likely? As if that could be, such a thing has never happened. No oneyoohears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you were toyootell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might defend meyoocompletely by doing so, for who would be likely to be such a criminal, ifyoohe is so open-hearted beforehand? Any one can see that.”yooyoo“Well,” and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck byyooSmerdyakov’s last argument. “I don’t suspect you at all, and I think it’syooabsurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am grateful to you foryoosetting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but I’ll come again. Meanwhile,yoogood-by. Get well. Is there anything you want?”yooyoo“I am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me,yooand provides me anything I want, according to her kindness. Good peopleyoovisit me every day.”yooyoo“Good-by. But I shan’t say anything of your being able to sham a fit, andyooI don’t advise you to, either,” something made Ivan say suddenly.yooyoo“I quite understand. And if you don’t speak of that, I shall say nothingyooof that conversation of ours at the gate.”yooyooThen it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had gone a dozenyoosteps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there was an insultingyoosignificance in Smerdyakov’s last words. He was almost on the point ofyooturning back, but it was only a passing impulse, and muttering,yoo“Nonsense!” he went out of the hospital.yooyooHis chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was notyooSmerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though he might haveyoobeen expected to feel the opposite. He did not want to analyze the reasonyoofor this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance at prying into hisyoosensations. He felt as though he wanted to make haste to forget something.yooIn the following days he became convinced of Mitya’s guilt, as he got toyooknow all the weight of evidence against him. There was evidence of peopleyooof no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of ityoowas almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and atyooPlotnikov’s shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidenceyooseemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret ofyoothe knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory’s evidence asyooto the open door. Grigory’s wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan’s questions,yoodeclared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of theyoopartition wall. “He was not three paces from our bed,” and that althoughyooshe was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, “Heyoowas moaning the whole time, moaning continually.”yooyooTalking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov wasyoonot mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtleyoosmile.yooyoo“Do you know how he spends his time now?” he asked; “learning lists ofyooFrench words by heart. He has an exercise-book under his pillow with theyooFrench words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he heyoohe!”yooyooIvan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri withoutyoorepulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted thatyooDmitri was not the murderer, and that “in all probability” Smerdyakov was.yooIvan always felt that Alyosha’s opinion meant a great deal to him, and soyoohe was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was thatyooAlyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that heyoonever began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too,yoostruck Ivan particularly.yooyooBut he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apartyoofrom that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly toyoohis mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the timeyooto begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan’s, which left its mark onyooall the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for anotheryoonovel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention hereyoothat when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I’ve relatedyooalready, told him, “I am not keen on her,” it was an absolute lie: heyooloved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might haveyoomurdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered byyoowhat had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan’s return to meet him asyooher one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings.yooAnd here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardentlyyoobefore (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect sheyooconsidered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did notyooabandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazovyooviolence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her. She wasyoocontinually tormented at the same time by remorse for having desertedyooMitya, and in moments of discord and violent anger (and they wereyoonumerous) she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to Alyoshayoo“lies upon lies.” There was, of course, much that was false in it, andyoothat angered Ivan more than anything.... But of all this later.yooyooHe did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov’s existence, and yet,yooa fortnight after his first visit to him, he began to be haunted by theyoosame strange thoughts as before. It’s enough to say that he wasyoocontinually asking himself, why was it that on that last night in FyodoryooPavlovitch’s house he had crept out on to the stairs like a thief andyoolistened to hear what his father was doing below? Why had he recalled thatyooafterwards with repulsion? Why next morning, had he been suddenly soyoodepressed on the journey? Why, as he reached Moscow, had he said toyoohimself, “I am a scoundrel”? And now he almost fancied that theseyootormenting thoughts would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna, soyoocompletely did they take possession of him again. It was just afteryoofancying this, that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at once,yooand put a question to him:yooyoo“Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father, andyooafterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved ‘the right toyoodesire’?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired father’s death oryoonot?”yooyoo“I did think so,” answered Alyosha, softly.yooyoo“It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn’t you fancyyoothen that what I wished was just that ‘one reptile should devour another’;yoothat is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as possible ...yooand that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about?”yooyooAlyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother’s face.yooyoo“Speak!” cried Ivan, “I want above everything to know what you thoughtyoothen. I want the truth, the truth!”yooyooHe drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came.yooyoo“Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,” whispered Alyosha, andyoohe did not add one softening phrase.yooyoo“Thanks,” snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on his way.yooFrom that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him andyooseemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so much so that Alyosha gaveyooup going to see him. Immediately after that meeting with him, Ivan had notyoogone home, but went straight to Smerdyakov again.yooyooyooyooChapter VII. The Second Visit To SmerdyakovyooyooyooBy that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital. Ivan knewyoohis new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house, divided in two by ayoopassage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her mother, andyooon the other, Smerdyakov. No one knew on what terms he lived with them,yoowhether as a friend or as a lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he hadyoocome to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna’s betrothed, and was livingyoothere for a time without paying for board or lodging. Both mother andyoodaughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatlyyoosuperior to themselves.yooyooIvan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into theyoopassage. By Marya Kondratyevna’s directions he went straight to the betteryooroom on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was a tiled stove in theyooroom and it was extremely hot. The walls were gay with blue paper, whichyoowas a good deal used however, and in the cracks under it cockroachesyooswarmed in amazing numbers, so that there was a continual rustling fromyoothem. The furniture was very scanty: two benches against each wall and twoyoochairs by the table. The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth withyoopink patterns on it. There was a pot of geranium on each of the two littleyoowindows. In the corner there was a case of ikons. On the table stood ayoolittle copper samovar with many dents in it, and a tray with two cups. ButyooSmerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out. He was sitting at theyootable on a bench. He was looking at an exercise-book and slowly writingyoowith a pen. There was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick,yoobut with a composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov’s face thatyoohe had completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher,yoofuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down at theyoosides. He was sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown, ratheryoodirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles on his nose, which Ivan hadyoonever seen him wearing before. This trifling circumstance suddenlyyooredoubled Ivan’s anger: “A creature like that and wearing spectacles!”yooyooSmerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his visitoryoothrough his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and rose from theyoobench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily, doing the leastyoopossible required by common civility. All this struck Ivan instantly; heyootook it all in and noted it at once—most of all the look in Smerdyakov’syooeyes, positively malicious, churlish and haughty. “What do you want toyoointrude for?” it seemed to say; “we settled everything then; why have youyoocome again?” Ivan could scarcely control himself.yooyoo“It’s hot here,” he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his overcoat.yooyoo“Take off your coat,” Smerdyakov conceded.yooyooIvan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands. Heyootook a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down. Smerdyakovyoomanaged to sit down on his bench before him.yooyoo“To begin with, are we alone?” Ivan asked sternly and impulsively. “Canyoothey overhear us in there?”yooyoo“No one can hear anything. You’ve seen for yourself: there’s a passage.”yooyoo“Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was leaving theyoohospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of shamming fits, youyoowouldn’t tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation at the gate?yooWhat do you mean by _all_? What could you mean by it? Were you threateningyoome? Have I entered into some sort of compact with you? Do you suppose I amyooafraid of you?”yooyooIvan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with obviousyoointention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to showyoohis cards. Smerdyakov’s eyes gleamed resentfully, his left eye winked, andyoohe at once gave his answer, with his habitual composure and deliberation.yoo“You want to have everything above-board; very well, you shall have it,”yoohe seemed to say.yooyoo“This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you, knowingyoobeforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him to his fate, andyoothat people mightn’t after that conclude any evil about your feelings andyooperhaps of something else, too—that’s what I promised not to tell theyooauthorities.”yooyooThough Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself,yooyet there was something in his voice, determined and emphatic, resentfulyooand insolently defiant. He stared impudently at Ivan. A mist passed beforeyooIvan’s eyes for the first moment.yooyoo“How? What? Are you out of your mind?”yooyoo“I’m perfectly in possession of all my faculties.”yooyoo“Do you suppose I _knew_ of the murder?” Ivan cried at last, and heyoobrought his fist violently on the table. “What do you mean by ‘somethingyooelse, too’? Speak, scoundrel!”yooyooSmerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent stare.yooyoo“Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that ‘something else, too’?”yooyoo“The ‘something else’ I meant was that you probably, too, were veryyoodesirous of your parent’s death.”yooyooIvan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder, so thatyoohe fell back against the wall. In an instant his face was bathed in tears.yooSaying, “It’s a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,” he dried his eyes withyooa very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping. A minuteyoopassed.yooyoo“That’s enough! Leave off,” Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again.yoo“Don’t put me out of all patience.”yooyooSmerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his puckered faceyooreflected the insult he had just received.yooyoo“So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri I meant toyookill my father?”yooyoo“I didn’t know what thoughts were in your mind then,” said Smerdyakovyooresentfully; “and so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on thatyoovery point.”yooyoo“To sound what, what?”yooyoo“Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father to beyoomurdered or not.”yooyooWhat infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive, insolent toneyooto which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.yooyoo“It was you murdered him?” he cried suddenly.yooyooSmerdyakov smiled contemptuously.yooyoo“You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn’t I murdered him. And Iyooshould have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak ofyooit again.”yooyoo“But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?”yooyoo“As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such ayooposition, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I resolved toyoosound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother, thenyoothe business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly,yootoo.”yooyoo“Look here, you didn’t say that a fortnight ago.”yooyoo“I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I thoughtyooyou’d understand without wasting words, and that being such a sensible manyooyou wouldn’t care to talk of it openly.”yooyoo“What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ... what could Iyoohave done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul?”yooyoo“As for the murder, you couldn’t have done that and didn’t want to, but asyoofor wanting some one else to do it, that was just what you did want.”yooyoo“And how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have wanted it;yoowhat grounds had I for wanting it?”yooyoo“What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?” said Smerdyakovyoosarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. “Why, after your parent’syoodeath there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you, and veryyoolikely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that lady,yooAgrafena Alexandrovna, she would have had all his capital made over to heryoodirectly after the wedding, for she’s plenty of sense, so that your parentyoowould not have left you two roubles between the three of you. And wereyoothey far from a wedding, either? Not a hair’s-breadth: that lady had onlyyooto lift her little finger and he would have run after her to church, withyoohis tongue out.”yooyooIvan restrained himself with painful effort.yooyoo“Very good,” he commented at last. “You see, I haven’t jumped up, Iyoohaven’t knocked you down, I haven’t killed you. Speak on. So, according toyooyou, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning on him?”yooyoo“How could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then he would loseyooall the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property, and would go off toyooexile; so his share of the inheritance would come to you and your brotheryooAlexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so you’d each have not forty, butyoosixty thousand each. There’s not a doubt you did reckon on DmitriyooFyodorovitch.”yooyoo“What I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had reckoned on anyyooone then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri, and I swear I didyooexpect some wickedness from you ... at the time.... I remember myyooimpression!”yooyoo“I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning on meyooas well,” said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin. “So that it was just byyoothat more than anything you showed me what was in your mind. For if youyoohad a foreboding about me and yet went away, you as good as said to me,yoo‘You can murder my parent, I won’t hinder you!’ ”yooyoo“You scoundrel! So that’s how you understood it!”yooyoo“It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were meaning to go toyooMoscow and refused all your father’s entreaties to go to Tchermashnya—andyoosimply at a foolish word from me you consented at once! What reason hadyooyou to consent to Tchermashnya? Since you went to Tchermashnya with noyooreason, simply at my word, it shows that you must have expected somethingyoofrom me.”yooyoo“No, I swear I didn’t!” shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.yooyoo“You didn’t? Then you ought, as your father’s son, to have had me taken toyoothe lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least, toyoohave given me a punch in the face on the spot, but you were not a bityooangry, if you please, and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolishyooword and went away, which was utterly absurd, for you ought to have stayedyooto save your parent’s life. How could I help drawing my conclusions?”yooyooIvan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees.yooyoo“Yes, I am sorry I didn’t punch you in the face,” he said with a bitteryoosmile. “I couldn’t have taken you to the lock-up just then. Who would haveyoobelieved me and what charge could I bring against you? But the punch inyoothe face ... oh, I’m sorry I didn’t think of it. Though blows areyooforbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly.”yooyooSmerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.yooyoo“In the ordinary occasions of life,” he said in the same complacent andyoosententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him aboutyooreligion at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s table, “in the ordinary occasions of life,yooblows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law, and people have givenyoothem up, but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows,yoonot only among us but all over the world, be it even the fullest Republicyooof France, just as in the time of Adam and Eve, and they never will leaveyoooff, but you, even in an exceptional case, did not dare.”yooyoo“What are you learning French words for?” Ivan nodded towards theyooexercise-book lying on the table.yooyoo“Why shouldn’t I learn them so as to improve my education, supposing thatyooI may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe?”yooyoo“Listen, monster.” Ivan’s eyes flashed and he trembled all over. “I am notyooafraid of your accusations; you can say what you like about me, and if Iyoodon’t beat you to death, it’s simply because I suspect you of that crimeyooand I’ll drag you to justice. I’ll unmask you.”yooyoo“To my thinking, you’d better keep quiet, for what can you accuse me of,yooconsidering my absolute innocence? and who would believe you? Only if youyoobegin, I shall tell everything, too, for I must defend myself.”yooyoo“Do you think I am afraid of you now?”yooyoo“If the court doesn’t believe all I’ve said to you just now, the publicyoowill, and you will be ashamed.”yooyoo“That’s as much as to say, ‘It’s always worth while speaking to a sensibleyooman,’ eh?” snarled Ivan.yooyoo“You hit the mark, indeed. And you’d better be sensible.”yooyooIvan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat, andyoowithout replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at him,yoowalked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air refreshed him.yooThere was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare of ideas and sensationsyoofilled his soul. “Shall I go at once and give information againstyooSmerdyakov? But what information can I give? He is not guilty, anyway. Onyoothe contrary, he’ll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off foryooTchermashnya then? What for? What for?” Ivan asked himself. “Yes, ofyoocourse, I was expecting something and he is right....” And he rememberedyoofor the hundredth time how, on the last night in his father’s house, heyoohad listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguishyoothat he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. “Yes, Iyooexpected it then, that’s true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder!yooDid I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don’tyoodare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!”yooyooIvan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmedyooher by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated all hisyooconversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He couldn’t be calmed,yoohowever much she tried to soothe him: he kept walking about the room,yoospeaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last he sat down, put his elbows onyoothe table, leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strangeyoosentence: “If it’s not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov who’s the murderer, I shareyoohis guilt, for I put him up to it. Whether I did, I don’t know yet. But ifyoohe is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer,yootoo.”yooyooWhen Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat without ayooword, went to her writing-table, opened a box standing on it, took out ayoosheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the document of whichyooIvan spoke to Alyosha later on as a “conclusive proof” that Dmitri hadyookilled his father. It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovnayoowhen he was drunk, on the very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads onyoothe way to the monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna’s, whenyooGrushenka had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushedyooto Grushenka. I don’t know whether he saw her, but in the evening he wasyooat the “Metropolis,” where he got thoroughly drunk. Then he asked for penyooand paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself. It wasyooa wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. It wasyoolike the talk of a drunken man, who, on his return home, begins withyooextraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he hasyoojust been insulted, what a rascal had just insulted him, what a fineyoofellow he is on the other hand, and how he will pay that scoundrel out;yooand all that at great length, with great excitement and incoherence, withyoodrunken tears and blows on the table. The letter was written on a dirtyyoopiece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by theyootavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There wasyooevidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not onlyyoofilled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest.yooThe letter ran as follows:yooyooyoo    FATAL KATYA: To-morrow I will get the money and repay your threeyoo    thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, myyoo    love! Let us make an end! To-morrow I shall try and get it fromyoo    every one, and if I can’t borrow it, I give you my word of honor Iyoo    shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money fromyoo    under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone. If I have to go toyoo    Siberia for it, I’ll give you back your three thousand. Andyoo    farewell. I bow down to the ground before you, for I’ve been ayoo    scoundrel to you. Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, you’ll beyoo    happier and so shall I! Better Siberia than your love, for I loveyoo    another woman and you got to know her too well to-day, so how canyoo    you forgive? I will murder the man who’s robbed me! I’ll leave youyoo    all and go to the East so as to see no one again. Not _her_yoo    either, for you are not my only tormentress; she is too. Farewell!yooyoo    P.S.—I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my heart. Oneyoo    string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two! Iyoo    shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear threeyoo    thousand from him and fling it to you. Though I’ve been ayoo    scoundrel to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand.yoo    The cur keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not ayoo    thief, but I’ll murder my thief. Katya, don’t look disdainful.yoo    Dmitri is not a thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his fatheryoo    and ruined himself to hold his ground, rather than endure youryoo    pride. And he doesn’t love you.yooyoo    P.P.S.—I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.—Katya, pray to Godyoo    that some one’ll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped inyoo    gore, and if no one does—I shall! Kill me!yooyoo    Your slave and enemy,yooyoo    D. KARAMAZOV.yooyooyooWhen Ivan read this “document” he was convinced. So then it was hisyoobrother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. Thisyooletter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. Thereyoocould be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya’s guilt. The suspicionyoonever occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed theyoomurder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did notyoofit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning heyooonly thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days lateryoohe positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed atyoohis suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him.yooSo passed a month. He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twiceyoohe happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind.yooyoo“He’ll end in madness,” the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him, andyooIvan remembered this. During the last week of that month Ivan himselfyoobegan to feel very ill. He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had beenyoosent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And just at that timeyoohis relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They wereyoolike two enemies in love with one another. Katerina Ivanovna’s “returns”yooto Mitya, that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in hisyoofavor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last sceneyoodescribed above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivanyoohad never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of Mitya’syooguilt, in spite of those “returns” that were so hateful to him. It isyooremarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more and moreyooevery day, he realized that it was not on account of Katya’s “returns”yoothat he hated him, but just _because he was the murderer of his father_.yooHe was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself.yooyooNevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposedyooto him a plan of escape—a plan he had obviously thought over a long time.yooHe was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heartyoofrom a phrase of Smerdyakov’s, that it was to his, Ivan’s, advantage thatyoohis brother should be convicted, as that would increase his inheritanceyooand Alyosha’s from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He determined toyoosacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya’s escape. On his return fromyooseeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feelyoothat he was anxious for Mitya’s escape, not only to heal that sore placeyooby sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. “Is it because Iyooam as much a murderer at heart?” he asked himself. Something very deepyoodown seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above all sufferedyoocruelly all that month. But of that later....yooyooWhen, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with hisyoohand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a suddenyooand peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how KaterinayooIvanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha’s presence: “It wasyooyou, you, persuaded me of his” (that is, Mitya’s) “guilt!” Ivan wasyoothunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade heryoothat Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself inyooher presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was _she_,yooshe, who had produced that “document” and proved his brother’s guilt. Andyoonow she suddenly exclaimed: “I’ve been at Smerdyakov’s myself!” When hadyooshe been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all soyoosure of Mitya’s guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What,yoowhat, had he said to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He couldyoonot understand how he could, half an hour before, have let those wordsyoopass and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell andyoorushed off to Smerdyakov. “I shall kill him, perhaps, this time,” heyoothought on the way.yooyooyooyooChapter VIII. The Third And Last Interview With SmerdyakovyooyooyooWhen he was half-way there, the keen dry wind that had been blowing earlyyoothat morning rose again, and a fine dry snow began falling thickly. It didyoonot lie on the ground, but was whirled about by the wind, and soon thereyoowas a regular snowstorm. There were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part ofyoothe town where Smerdyakov lived. Ivan strode alone in the darkness,yoounconscious of the storm, instinctively picking out his way. His headyooached and there was a painful throbbing in his temples. He felt that hisyoohands were twitching convulsively. Not far from Marya Kondratyevna’syoocottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken little peasant. He wasyoowearing a coarse and patched coat, and was walking in zigzags, grumblingyooand swearing to himself. Then suddenly he would begin singing in a huskyyoodrunken voice:yooyooyoo    “Ach, Vanka’s gone to Petersburg;yoo    I won’t wait till he comes back.”yooyooyooBut he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing again;yoothen he would begin the same song again. Ivan felt an intense hatred foryoohim before he had thought about him at all. Suddenly he realized hisyoopresence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him down. At thatyoomoment they met, and the peasant with a violent lurch fell full tiltyooagainst Ivan, who pushed him back furiously. The peasant went flyingyoobackwards and fell like a log on the frozen ground. He uttered oneyooplaintive “O—oh!” and then was silent. Ivan stepped up to him. He wasyoolying on his back, without movement or consciousness. “He will be frozen,”yoothought Ivan, and he went on his way to Smerdyakov’s.yooyooIn the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the door with ayoocandle in her hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was very ill, “It’s not thatyoohe’s laid up, but he seems not himself, and he even told us to take theyootea away; he wouldn’t have any.”yooyoo“Why, does he make a row?” asked Ivan coarsely.yooyoo“Oh, dear, no, quite the contrary, he’s very quiet. Only please don’t talkyooto him too long,” Marya Kondratyevna begged him. Ivan opened the door andyoostepped into the room.yooyooIt was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the room. One ofyoothe benches at the side had been removed, and in its place had been put ayoolarge old mahogany leather sofa, on which a bed had been made up, withyoofairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa, wearingyoothe same dressing-gown. The table had been brought out in front of theyoosofa, so that there was hardly room to move. On the table lay a thick bookyooin yellow cover, but Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed to beyoositting doing nothing. He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and wasyooapparently not at all surprised at his coming. There was a great change inyoohis face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes were sunken and thereyoowere blue marks under them.yooyoo“Why, you really are ill?” Ivan stopped short. “I won’t keep you long, Iyoowon’t even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?”yooyooHe went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and sat down onyooit.yooyoo“Why do you look at me without speaking? I’ve only come with one question,yooand I swear I won’t go without an answer. Has the young lady, KaterinayooIvanovna, been with you?”yooyooSmerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as before.yooSuddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face away.yooyoo“What’s the matter with you?” cried Ivan.yooyoo“Nothing.”yooyoo“What do you mean by ‘nothing’?”yooyoo“Yes, she has. It’s no matter to you. Let me alone.”yooyoo“No, I won’t let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?”yooyoo“Why, I’d quite forgotten about her,” said Smerdyakov, with a scornfulyoosmile, and turning his face to Ivan again, he stared at him with a look ofyoofrenzied hatred, the same look that he had fixed on him at their lastyoointerview, a month before.yooyoo“You seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you don’t look likeyooyourself,” he said to Ivan.yooyoo“Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.”yooyoo“But why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow. Are you soyooworried?” He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright.yooyoo“Listen; I’ve told you I won’t go away without an answer!” Ivan cried,yoointensely irritated.yooyoo“Why do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?” said Smerdyakov,yoowith a look of suffering.yooyoo“Damn it! I’ve nothing to do with you. Just answer my question and I’ll goyooaway.”yooyoo“I’ve no answer to give you,” said Smerdyakov, looking down again.yooyoo“You may be sure I’ll make you answer!”yooyoo“Why are you so uneasy?” Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply withyoocontempt, but almost with repulsion. “Is this because the trial beginsyooto-morrow? Nothing will happen to you; can’t you believe that at last? Goyoohome, go to bed and sleep in peace, don’t be afraid of anything.”yooyoo“I don’t understand you.... What have I to be afraid of to-morrow?” Ivanyooarticulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill breath of fear did inyoofact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes.yooyoo“You don’t understand?” he drawled reproachfully. “It’s a strange thing ayoosensible man should care to play such a farce!”yooyooIvan looked at him speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious toneyooof this man who had once been his valet, was extraordinary in itself. Heyoohad not taken such a tone even at their last interview.yooyoo“I tell you, you’ve nothing to be afraid of. I won’t say anything aboutyooyou; there’s no proof against you. I say, how your hands are trembling!yooWhy are your fingers moving like that? Go home, _you_ did not murder him.”yooyooIvan started. He remembered Alyosha.yooyoo“I know it was not I,” he faltered.yooyoo“Do you?” Smerdyakov caught him up again.yooyooIvan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder.yooyoo“Tell me everything, you viper! Tell me everything!”yooyooSmerdyakov was not in the least scared. He only riveted his eyes on Ivanyoowith insane hatred.yooyoo“Well, it was you who murdered him, if that’s it,” he whispered furiously.yooyooIvan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something. He laughedyoomalignantly.yooyoo“You mean my going away. What you talked about last time?”yooyoo“You stood before me last time and understood it all, and you understandyooit now.”yooyoo“All I understand is that you are mad.”yooyoo“Aren’t you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what’s the use of goingyooon keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still trying to throw it allyooon me, to my face? _You_ murdered him; you are the real murderer, I wasyooonly your instrument, your faithful servant, and it was following youryoowords I did it.”yooyoo“_Did_ it? Why, did you murder him?” Ivan turned cold.yooyooSomething seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all over withyooa cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him wonderingly; probablyyoothe genuineness of Ivan’s horror struck him.yooyoo“You don’t mean to say you really did not know?” he falteredyoomistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan still gazedyooat him, and seemed unable to speak.yooyooyoo    Ach, Vanka’s gone to Petersburg;yoo    I won’t wait till he comes back,yooyooyoosuddenly echoed in his head.yooyoo“Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom sitting beforeyoome,” he muttered.yooyoo“There’s no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No doubt he isyoohere, that third, between us.”yooyoo“Who is he? Who is here? What third person?” Ivan cried in alarm, lookingyooabout him, his eyes hastily searching in every corner.yooyoo“That third is God Himself—Providence. He is the third beside us now. Onlyyoodon’t look for Him, you won’t find Him.”yooyoo“It’s a lie that you killed him!” Ivan cried madly. “You are mad, oryooteasing me again!”yooyooSmerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of fear. Heyoocould still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still fancied that Ivanyooknew everything and was trying to “throw it all on him to his face.”yooyoo“Wait a minute,” he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly bringing upyoohis left leg from under the table, he began turning up his trouser leg. Heyoowas wearing long white stockings and slippers. Slowly he took off hisyoogarter and fumbled to the bottom of his stocking. Ivan gazed at him, andyoosuddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror.yooyoo“He’s mad!” he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back, so that heyooknocked his back against the wall and stood up against it, stiff andyoostraight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov, who, entirelyyoounaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his stocking, as though heyoowere making an effort to get hold of something with his fingers and pullyooit out. At last he got hold of it and began pulling it out. Ivan saw thatyooit was a piece of paper, or perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled ityooout and laid it on the table.yooyoo“Here,” he said quietly.yooyoo“What is it?” asked Ivan, trembling.yooyoo“Kindly look at it,” Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low tone.yooyooIvan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and beganyoounfolding it, but suddenly he drew back his fingers, as though fromyoocontact with a loathsome reptile.yooyoo“Your hands keep twitching,” observed Smerdyakov, and he deliberatelyyoounfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were three packets ofyoohundred-rouble notes.yooyoo“They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not countyoothem. Take them,” Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at the notes. Ivanyoosank back in his chair. He was as white as a handkerchief.yooyoo“You frightened me ... with your stocking,” he said, with a strange grin.yooyoo“Can you really not have known till now?” Smerdyakov asked once more.yooyoo“No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother, brother! Ach!” Heyoosuddenly clutched his head in both hands.yooyoo“Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother’s help or without?”yooyoo“It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and DmitriyooFyodorovitch is quite innocent.”yooyoo“All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on trembling? Iyoocan’t speak properly.”yooyoo“You were bold enough then. You said ‘everything was lawful,’ and howyoofrightened you are now,” Smerdyakov muttered in surprise. “Won’t you haveyoosome lemonade? I’ll ask for some at once. It’s very refreshing. Only Iyoomust hide this first.”yooyooAnd again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get up and callyooat the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them,yoobut, looking for something to cover up the notes that she might not seeyoothem, he first took out his handkerchief, and as it turned out to be veryyoodirty, took up the big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at first lying onyoothe table, and put it over the notes. The book was _The Sayings of theyooHoly Father Isaac the Syrian_. Ivan read it mechanically.yooyoo“I won’t have any lemonade,” he said. “Talk of me later. Sit down and tellyoome how you did it. Tell me all about it.”yooyoo“You’d better take off your greatcoat, or you’ll be too hot.” Ivan, asyoothough he’d only just thought of it, took off his coat, and, withoutyoogetting up from his chair, threw it on the bench.yooyoo“Speak, please, speak.”yooyooHe seemed calmer. He waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov would tell himyoo_all_ about it.yooyoo“How it was done?” sighed Smerdyakov. “It was done in a most natural way,yoofollowing your very words.”yooyoo“Of my words later,” Ivan broke in again, apparently with completeyooself-possession, firmly uttering his words, and not shouting as before.yoo“Only tell me in detail how you did it. Everything, as it happened. Don’tyooforget anything. The details, above everything, the details, I beg you.”yooyoo“You’d gone away, then I fell into the cellar.”yooyoo“In a fit or in a sham one?”yooyoo“A sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. I went quietly down the steps toyoothe very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay down I gave a scream,yooand struggled, till they carried me out.”yooyoo“Stay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in the hospital?”yooyoo“No, not at all. Next day, in the morning, before they took me to theyoohospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than I’ve had foryooyears. For two days I was quite unconscious.”yooyoo“All right, all right. Go on.”yooyoo“They laid me on the bed. I knew I’d be the other side of the partition,yoofor whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me there, near them.yooShe’s always been very kind to me, from my birth up. At night I moaned,yoobut quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri Fyodorovitch to come.”yooyoo“Expecting him? To come to you?”yooyoo“Not to me. I expected him to come into the house, for I’d no doubt thatyoohe’d come that night, for being without me and getting no news, he’d beyoosure to come and climb over the fence, as he used to, and do something.”yooyoo“And if he hadn’t come?”yooyoo“Then nothing would have happened. I should never have brought myself toyooit without him.”yooyoo“All right, all right ... speak more intelligibly, don’t hurry; above all,yoodon’t leave anything out!”yooyoo“I expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was certain, foryooI had prepared him for it ... during the last few days.... He knew aboutyoothe knocks, that was the chief thing. With his suspiciousness and the furyyoowhich had been growing in him all those days, he was bound to get into theyoohouse by means of those taps. That was inevitable, so I was expectingyoohim.”yooyoo“Stay,” Ivan interrupted; “if he had killed him, he would have taken theyoomoney and carried it away; you must have considered that. What would youyoohave got by it afterwards? I don’t see.”yooyoo“But he would never have found the money. That was only what I told him,yoothat the money was under the mattress. But that wasn’t true. It had beenyoolying in a box. And afterwards I suggested to Fyodor Pavlovitch, as I wasyoothe only person he trusted, to hide the envelope with the notes in theyoocorner behind the ikons, for no one would have guessed that place,yooespecially if they came in a hurry. So that’s where the envelope lay, inyoothe corner behind the ikons. It would have been absurd to keep it underyoothe mattress; the box, anyway, could be locked. But all believe it wasyoounder the mattress. A stupid thing to believe. So if Dmitri Fyodorovitchyoohad committed the murder, finding nothing, he would either have run awayyooin a hurry, afraid of every sound, as always happens with murderers, or heyoowould have been arrested. So I could always have clambered up to the ikonsyooand have taken away the money next morning or even that night, and ityoowould have all been put down to Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I could reckon uponyoothat.”yooyoo“But what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him down?”yooyoo“If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured to take theyoomoney, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated that he wouldyoobeat him senseless, and I should have time to take it then, and then I’dyoomake out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one but Dmitri Fyodorovitchyoowho had taken the money after beating him.”yooyoo“Stop ... I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all who killed him;yooyou only took the money?”yooyoo“No, he didn’t kill him. Well, I might as well have told you now that heyoowas the murderer.... But I don’t want to lie to you now, because ...yoobecause if you really haven’t understood till now, as I see for myself,yooand are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt on me to my very face,yooyou are still responsible for it all, since you knew of the murder andyoocharged me to do it, and went away knowing all about it. And so I want toyooprove to your face this evening that you are the only real murderer in theyoowhole affair, and I am not the real murderer, though I did kill him. Youyooare the rightful murderer.”yooyoo“Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!” Ivan cried, unable to restrainyoohimself at last, and forgetting that he had put off discussing himselfyootill the end of the conversation. “You still mean that Tchermashnya? Stay,yootell me, why did you want my consent, if you really took Tchermashnya foryooconsent? How will you explain that now?”yooyoo“Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn’t have madeyooan outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if I’d beenyoosuspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his accomplice; on theyoocontrary, you would have protected me from others.... And when you gotyooyour inheritance you would have rewarded me when you were able, all theyoorest of your life. For you’d have received your inheritance through me,yooseeing that if he had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn’t have hadyooa farthing.”yooyoo“Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,” snarled Ivan.yoo“And what if I hadn’t gone away then, but had informed against you?”yooyoo“What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to Tchermashnya?yooThat’s all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation you would either haveyoogone away or have stayed. If you had stayed, nothing would have happened.yooI should have known that you didn’t want it done, and should haveyooattempted nothing. As you went away, it meant you assured me that youyoowouldn’t dare to inform against me at the trial, and that you’d overlookyoomy having the three thousand. And, indeed, you couldn’t have prosecuted meyooafterwards, because then I should have told it all in the court; that is,yoonot that I had stolen the money or killed him—I shouldn’t have saidyoothat—but that you’d put me up to the theft and the murder, though I didn’tyooconsent to it. That’s why I needed your consent, so that you couldn’t haveyoocornered me afterwards, for what proof could you have had? I could alwaysyoohave cornered you, revealing your eagerness for your father’s death, and Iyootell you the public would have believed it all, and you would have beenyooashamed for the rest of your life.”yooyoo“Was I then so eager, was I?” Ivan snarled again.yooyoo“To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned my doingyooit.” Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He was very weak and spokeyooslowly and wearily, but some hidden inner force urged him on. He evidentlyyoohad some design. Ivan felt that.yooyoo“Go on,” he said. “Tell me what happened that night.”yooyoo“What more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard the masteryooshout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly got up and cameyooout, and he suddenly gave a scream, and then all was silence and darkness.yooI lay there waiting, my heart beating; I couldn’t bear it. I got up atyoolast, went out. I saw the window open on the left into the garden, and Iyoostepped to the left to listen whether he was sitting there alive, and Iyooheard the master moving about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. ‘Ech!’ Iyoothought. I went to the window and shouted to the master, ‘It’s I.’ And heyooshouted to me, ‘He’s been, he’s been; he’s run away.’ He meant DmitriyooFyodorovitch had been. ‘He’s killed Grigory!’ ‘Where?’ I whispered.yoo‘There, in the corner,’ he pointed. He was whispering, too. ‘Wait a bit,’yooI said. I went to the corner of the garden to look, and there I came uponyooGrigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall, covered with blood, senseless. Soyooit’s true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, was the thought thatyoocame into my head, and I determined on the spot to make an end of it, asyooGrigory Vassilyevitch, even if he were alive, would see nothing of it, asyoohe lay there senseless. The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wakeyooup. I felt that at the moment, but the longing to get it done came overyoome, till I could scarcely breathe. I went back to the window to the masteryooand said, ‘She’s here, she’s come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wantsyooto be let in.’ And he started like a baby. ‘Where is she?’ he fairlyyoogasped, but couldn’t believe it. ‘She’s standing there,’ said I. ‘Open.’yooHe looked out of the window at me, half believing and half distrustful,yoobut afraid to open. ‘Why, he is afraid of me now,’ I thought. And it wasyoofunny. I bethought me to knock on the window-frame those taps we’d agreedyooupon as a signal that Grushenka had come, in his presence, before hisyooeyes. He didn’t seem to believe my word, but as soon as he heard the taps,yoohe ran at once to open the door. He opened it. I would have gone in, butyoohe stood in the way to prevent me passing. ‘Where is she? Where is she?’yooHe looked at me, all of a tremble. ‘Well,’ thought I, ‘if he’s soyoofrightened of me as all that, it’s a bad look out!’ And my legs went weakyoowith fright that he wouldn’t let me in or would call out, or MarfayooIgnatyevna would run up, or something else might happen. I don’t rememberyoonow, but I must have stood pale, facing him. I whispered to him, ‘Why,yooshe’s there, there, under the window; how is it you don’t see her?’ Iyoosaid. ‘Bring her then, bring her.’ ‘She’s afraid,’ said I; ‘she wasyoofrightened at the noise, she’s hidden in the bushes; go and call to heryooyourself from the study.’ He ran to the window, put the candle in theyoowindow. ‘Grushenka,’ he cried, ‘Grushenka, are you here?’ Though he criedyoothat, he didn’t want to lean out of the window, he didn’t want to moveyooaway from me, for he was panic-stricken; he was so frightened he didn’tyoodare to turn his back on me. ‘Why, here she is,’ said I. I went up to theyoowindow and leaned right out of it. ‘Here she is; she’s in the bush,yoolaughing at you, don’t you see her?’ He suddenly believed it; he was allyooof a shake—he was awfully crazy about her—and he leaned right out of theyoowindow. I snatched up that iron paper-weight from his table; do youyooremember, weighing about three pounds? I swung it and hit him on the topyooof the skull with the corner of it. He didn’t even cry out. He only sankyoodown suddenly, and I hit him again and a third time. And the third time Iyooknew I’d broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back, face upwards,yoocovered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood on me, not a spot.yooI wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up to the ikons, took theyoomoney out of the envelope, and flung the envelope on the floor and theyoopink ribbon beside it. I went out into the garden all of a tremble,yoostraight to the apple-tree with a hollow in it—you know that hollow. I’dyoomarked it long before and put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it. Iyoowrapped all the notes in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. Andyoothere it stayed for over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came outyooof the hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, ‘If GrigoryyooVassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me, but ifyoohe is not killed and recovers, it will be first-rate, for then he’ll bearyoowitness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he must have killedyoohim and taken the money.’ Then I began groaning with suspense andyooimpatience, so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible. At lastyooshe got up and she rushed to me, but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitchyoowas not there, she ran out, and I heard her scream in the garden. And thatyooset it all going and set my mind at rest.”yooyooHe stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence withoutyoostirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story Smerdyakovyooglanced at him from time to time, but for the most part kept his eyesyooaverted. When he had finished he was evidently agitated and was breathingyoohard. The perspiration stood out on his face. But it was impossible toyootell whether it was remorse he was feeling, or what.yooyoo“Stay,” cried Ivan, pondering. “What about the door? If he only opened theyoodoor to you, how could Grigory have seen it open before? For Grigory sawyooit before you went.”yooyooIt was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different tone, notyooangry as before, so if any one had opened the door at that moment andyoopeeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded that they wereyootalking peaceably about some ordinary, though interesting, subject.yooyoo“As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch’s having seen it open, that’syooonly his fancy,” said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile. “He is not a man, Iyooassure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn’t see it, but fancied he hadyooseen it, and there’s no shaking him. It’s just our luck he took thatyoonotion into his head, for they can’t fail to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitchyooafter that.”yooyoo“Listen ...” said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and making anyooeffort to grasp something. “Listen. There are a lot of questions I want toyooask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting and getting mixed up.yooYes. Tell me this at least, why did you open the envelope and leave ityoothere on the floor? Why didn’t you simply carry off the envelope?... Whenyooyou were telling me, I thought you spoke about it as though it were theyooright thing to do ... but why, I can’t understand....”yooyoo“I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about it, as Iyoodid for instance, if he’d seen those notes before, and perhaps had putyoothem in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope sealed up andyooaddressed, with his own eyes, if such a man had done the murder, whatyooshould have made him tear open the envelope afterwards, especially in suchyoodesperate haste, since he’d know for certain the notes must be in theyooenvelope? No, if the robber had been some one like me, he’d simply haveyooput the envelope straight in his pocket and got away with it as fast as heyoocould. But it’d be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He only knewyooabout the envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it, and if he’d found it,yoofor instance, under the mattress, he’d have torn it open as quickly asyoopossible to make sure the notes were in it. And he’d have thrown theyooenvelope down, without having time to think that it would be evidenceyooagainst him. Because he was not an habitual thief and had never directlyyoostolen anything before, for he is a gentleman born, and if he did bringyoohimself to steal, it would not be regular stealing, but simply taking whatyoowas his own, for he’d told the whole town he meant to before, and had evenyoobragged aloud before every one that he’d go and take his property fromyooFyodor Pavlovitch. I didn’t say that openly to the prosecutor when I wasyoobeing examined, but quite the contrary, I brought him to it by a hint, asyoothough I didn’t see it myself, and as though he’d thought of it himselfyooand I hadn’t prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecutor’s mouth positivelyyoowatered at my suggestion.”yooyoo“But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?” cried Ivan,yooovercome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov again with alarm.yooyoo“Mercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate hurry? Ityoowas all thought out beforehand.”yooyoo“Well ... well, it was the devil helped you!” Ivan cried again. “No, youyooare not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....”yooyooHe got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He was in terribleyoodistress. But as the table blocked his way, and there was hardly room toyoopass between the table and the wall, he only turned round where he stoodyooand sat down again. Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him, asyoohe suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before.yooyoo“Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don’t you understand thatyooif I haven’t killed you, it’s simply because I am keeping you to answeryooto-morrow at the trial. God sees,” Ivan raised his hand, “perhaps I, too,yoowas guilty; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father’s ...yoodeath, but I swear I was not as guilty as you think, and perhaps I didn’tyoourge you on at all. No, no, I didn’t urge you on! But no matter, I willyoogive evidence against myself to-morrow at the trial. I’m determined to! Iyooshall tell everything, everything. But we’ll make our appearance together.yooAnd whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence youyoogive, I’ll face it; I am not afraid of you. I’ll confirm it all myself!yooBut you must confess, too! You must, you must; we’ll go together. That’syoohow it shall be!”yooyooIvan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes alone ityoocould be seen that it would be so.yooyoo“You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,” Smerdyakovyoocommented, without the least irony, with apparent sympathy in fact.yooyoo“We’ll go together,” Ivan repeated. “And if you won’t go, no matter, I’llyoogo alone.”yooyooSmerdyakov paused as though pondering.yooyoo“There’ll be nothing of the sort, and you won’t go,” he concluded at lastyoopositively.yooyoo“You don’t understand me,” Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.yooyoo“You’ll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what’s more, ityoowill be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I never saidyooanything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill (and it looksyoolike it, too), or that you’re so sorry for your brother that you areyoosacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against me, foryooyou’ve always thought no more of me than if I’d been a fly. And who willyoobelieve you, and what single proof have you got?”yooyoo“Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.”yooyooSmerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.yooyoo“Take that money away with you,” Smerdyakov sighed.yooyoo“Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if youyoocommitted the murder for the sake of it?” Ivan looked at him with greatyoosurprise.yooyoo“I don’t want it,” Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice, with ayoogesture of refusal. “I did have an idea of beginning a new life with thatyoomoney in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream of it, chieflyyoobecause ‘all things are lawful.’ That was quite right what you taught me,yoofor you talked a lot to me about that. For if there’s no everlasting God,yoothere’s no such thing as virtue, and there’s no need of it. You were rightyoothere. So that’s how I looked at it.”yooyoo“Did you come to that of yourself?” asked Ivan, with a wry smile.yooyoo“With your guidance.”yooyoo“And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving back theyoomoney?”yooyoo“No, I don’t believe,” whispered Smerdyakov.yooyoo“Then why are you giving it back?”yooyoo“Leave off ... that’s enough!” Smerdyakov waved his hand again. “You usedyooto say yourself that everything was lawful, so now why are you so upset,yootoo? You even want to go and give evidence against yourself.... Onlyyoothere’ll be nothing of the sort! You won’t go to give evidence,”yooSmerdyakov decided with conviction.yooyoo“You’ll see,” said Ivan.yooyoo“It isn’t possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money, I knowyoothat. You like to be respected, too, for you’re very proud; you are faryootoo fond of female charms, too, and you mind most of all about living inyooundisturbed comfort, without having to depend on any one—that’s what youyoocare most about. You won’t want to spoil your life for ever by taking suchyooa disgrace on yourself. You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more likeyoohim than any of his children; you’ve the same soul as he had.”yooyoo“You are not a fool,” said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood rushed to hisyooface. “You are serious now!” he observed, looking suddenly at Smerdyakovyoowith a different expression.yooyoo“It was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the money.”yooyooIvan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket withoutyoowrapping them in anything.yooyoo“I shall show them at the court to-morrow,” he said.yooyoo“Nobody will believe you, as you’ve plenty of money of your own; you mayyoosimply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought it to the court.”yooyooIvan rose from his seat.yooyoo“I repeat,” he said, “the only reason I haven’t killed you is that I needyooyou for to-morrow, remember that, don’t forget it!”yooyoo“Well, kill me. Kill me now,” Smerdyakov said, all at once lookingyoostrangely at Ivan. “You won’t dare do that even!” he added, with a bitteryoosmile. “You won’t dare to do anything, you, who used to be so bold!”yooyoo“Till to-morrow,” cried Ivan, and moved to go out.yooyoo“Stay a moment.... Show me those notes again.”yooyooIvan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov looked at themyoofor ten seconds.yooyoo“Well, you can go,” he said, with a wave of his hand. “Ivan Fyodorovitch!”yoohe called after him again.yooyoo“What do you want?” Ivan turned without stopping.yooyoo“Good-by!”yooyoo“Till to-morrow!” Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the cottage.yooyooThe snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps boldly, butyoosuddenly began staggering. “It’s something physical,” he thought with ayoogrin. Something like joy was springing up in his heart. He was consciousyooof unbounded resolution; he would make an end of the wavering that had soyootortured him of late. His determination was taken, “and now it will not beyoochanged,” he thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled againstyoosomething and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his feetyoothe peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless. Theyoosnow had almost covered his face. Ivan seized him and lifted him in hisyooarms. Seeing a light in the little house to the right he went up, knockedyooat the shutters, and asked the man to whom the house belonged to help himyoocarry the peasant to the police-station, promising him three roubles. Theyooman got ready and came out. I won’t describe in detail how Ivan succeededyooin his object, bringing the peasant to the police-station and arrangingyoofor a doctor to see him at once, providing with a liberal hand for theyooexpenses. I will only say that this business took a whole hour, but Ivanyoowas well content with it. His mind wandered and worked incessantly.yooyoo“If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow,” he reflectedyoowith satisfaction, “I should not have stayed a whole hour to look afteryoothe peasant, but should have passed by, without caring about his beingyoofrozen. I am quite capable of watching myself, by the way,” he thought atyoothe same instant, with still greater satisfaction, “although they haveyoodecided that I am going out of my mind!”yooyooJust as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking himself suddenlyyoohadn’t he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him everything. Heyoodecided the question by turning back to the house. “Everything togetheryooto-morrow!” he whispered to himself, and, strange to say, almost all hisyoogladness and self-satisfaction passed in one instant.yooyooAs he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice on hisyooheart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of somethingyooagonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at that moment, and hadyoobeen there before. He sank wearily on his sofa. The old woman brought himyooa samovar; he made tea, but did not touch it. He sat on the sofa and feltyoogiddy. He felt that he was ill and helpless. He was beginning to dropyooasleep, but got up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off hisyoodrowsiness. At moments he fancied he was delirious, but it was not illnessyoothat he thought of most. Sitting down again, he began looking round, asyoothough searching for something. This happened several times. At last hisyooeyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled, but an angry flushyoosuffused his face. He sat a long time in his place, his head propped onyooboth arms, though he looked sideways at the same point, at the sofa thatyoostood against the opposite wall. There was evidently something, someyooobject, that irritated him there, worried him and tormented him.yooyooyooyooChapter IX. The Devil. Ivan’s NightmareyooyooyooI am not a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when I mustyooinevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivan’s illness.yooAnticipating events I can say at least one thing: he was at that moment onyoothe very eve of an attack of brain fever. Though his health had long beenyooaffected, it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in theyooend gained complete mastery over it. Though I know nothing of medicine, Iyooventure to hazard the suggestion that he really had perhaps, by a terribleyooeffort of will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, ofyoocourse, to check it completely. He knew that he was unwell, but he loathedyoothe thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching crisis inyoohis life, when he needed to have all his wits about him, to say what heyoohad to say boldly and resolutely and “to justify himself to himself.”yooyooHe had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been brought fromyooMoscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna’s to which I haveyooreferred already. After listening to him and examining him the doctor cameyooto the conclusion that he was actually suffering from some disorder of theyoobrain, and was not at all surprised by an admission which Ivan hadyooreluctantly made him. “Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition,”yoothe doctor opined, “though it would be better to verify them ... you mustyootake steps at once, without a moment’s delay, or things will go badly withyooyou.” But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice and did not take toyoohis bed to be nursed. “I am walking about, so I am strong enough, if Iyoodrop, it’ll be different then, any one may nurse me who likes,” heyoodecided, dismissing the subject.yooyooAnd so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium and, as Iyoohave said already, looking persistently at some object on the sofa againstyoothe opposite wall. Some one appeared to be sitting there, though goodnessyooknows how he had come in, for he had not been in the room when Ivan cameyoointo it, on his return from Smerdyakov. This was a person or, moreyooaccurately speaking, a Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longeryooyoung, _qui faisait la cinquantaine_, as the French say, with rather long,yoostill thick, dark hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointedyoobeard. He was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidentlyyoomade by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old,yoothat had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last twoyooyears. His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such as areyooworn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection hisyoolinen was not over-clean and his wide scarf was very threadbare. Theyoovisitor’s check trousers were of excellent cut, but were too light inyoocolor and too tight for the present fashion. His soft fluffy white hat wasyooout of keeping with the season.yooyooIn brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means. Ityoolooked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle landownersyoowho used to flourish in the times of serfdom. He had unmistakably been, atyoosome time, in good and fashionable society, had once had good connections,yoohad possibly preserved them indeed, but, after a gay youth, becomingyoogradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom, he had sunk into theyooposition of a poor relation of the best class, wandering from one good oldyoofriend to another and received by them for his companionable andyooaccommodating disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who couldyoobe asked to sit down with any one, though, of course, not in a place ofyoohonor. Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position, whoyoocan tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who have a distinct aversionyoofor any duties that may be forced upon them, are usually solitaryyoocreatures, either bachelors or widowers. Sometimes they have children, butyooif so, the children are always being brought up at a distance, at someyooaunt’s, to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society, seemingyooashamed of the relationship. They gradually lose sight of their childrenyooaltogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmasyooletter from them and sometimes even answer it.yooyooThe countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured, asyooaccommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion mightyooarise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise-shell lorgnette on a blackyooribbon. On the middle finger of his right hand was a massive gold ringyoowith a cheap opal stone in it.yooyooIvan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation. The visitoryoowaited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from hisyooroom to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly silent, seeingyoothat his host was frowning and preoccupied. But he was ready for anyyooaffable conversation as soon as his host should begin it. All at once hisyooface expressed a sudden solicitude.yooyoo“I say,” he began to Ivan, “excuse me, I only mention it to remind you.yooYou went to Smerdyakov’s to find out about Katerina Ivanovna, but you cameyooaway without finding out anything about her, you probably forgot—”yooyoo“Ah, yes,” broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness. “Yes,yooI’d forgotten ... but it doesn’t matter now, never mind, till to-morrow,”yoohe muttered to himself, “and you,” he added, addressing his visitor, “Iyooshould have remembered that myself in a minute, for that was just what wasyootormenting me! Why do you interfere, as if I should believe that youyooprompted me, and that I didn’t remember it of myself?”yooyoo“Don’t believe it then,” said the gentleman, smiling amicably, “what’s theyoogood of believing against your will? Besides, proofs are no help toyoobelieving, especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because he sawyooChrist risen, but because he wanted to believe, before he saw. Look at theyoospiritualists, for instance.... I am very fond of them ... only fancy,yoothey imagine that they are serving the cause of religion, because theyoodevils show them their horns from the other world. That, they say, is ayoomaterial proof, so to speak, of the existence of another world. The otheryooworld and material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, doesyooproving there’s a devil prove that there’s a God? I want to join anyooidealist society, I’ll lead the opposition in it, I’ll say I am a realist,yoobut not a materialist, he he!”yooyoo“Listen,” Ivan suddenly got up from the table. “I seem to be delirious....yooI am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like, I don’t care! Youyoowon’t drive me to fury, as you did last time. But I feel somehowyooashamed.... I want to walk about the room.... I sometimes don’t see youyooand don’t even hear your voice as I did last time, but I always guess whatyooyou are prating, for it’s I, _I myself speaking, not you_. Only I don’tyooknow whether I was dreaming last time or whether I really saw you. I’llyoowet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps you’ll vanish into air.”yooyooIvan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and with ayoowet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.yooyoo“I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,” the visitor began.yooyoo“Fool,” laughed Ivan, “do you suppose I should stand on ceremony with you?yooI am in good spirits now, though I’ve a pain in my forehead ... and in theyootop of my head ... only please don’t talk philosophy, as you did lastyootime. If you can’t take yourself off, talk of something amusing. Talkyoogossip, you are a poor relation, you ought to talk gossip. What ayoonightmare to have! But I am not afraid of you. I’ll get the better of you.yooI won’t be taken to a mad-house!”yooyoo“_C’est charmant_, poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape. For whatyooam I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am listening to you andyooam rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me foryoosomething real, not simply your fancy, as you persisted in declaring lastyootime—”yooyoo“Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,” Ivan cried with ayoosort of fury. “You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phantom. It’syooonly that I don’t know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer for ayootime. You are my hallucination. You are the incarnation of myself, butyooonly of one side of me ... of my thoughts and feelings, but only theyoonastiest and stupidest of them. From that point of view you might be ofyoointerest to me, if only I had time to waste on you—”yooyoo“Excuse me, excuse me, I’ll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha underyoothe lamp-post this evening and shouted to him, ‘You learnt it from _him_!yooHow do you know that _he_ visits me?’ you were thinking of me then. So foryooone brief moment you did believe that I really exist,” the gentlemanyoolaughed blandly.yooyoo“Yes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldn’t believe in you. Iyoodon’t know whether I was asleep or awake last time. Perhaps I was onlyyoodreaming then and didn’t see you really at all—”yooyoo“And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a dear; I’veyootreated him badly over Father Zossima.”yooyoo“Don’t talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!” Ivan laughed again.yooyoo“You scold me, but you laugh—that’s a good sign. But you are ever so muchyoomore polite than you were last time and I know why: that great resolutionyooof yours—”yooyoo“Don’t speak of my resolution,” cried Ivan, savagely.yooyoo“I understand, I understand, _c’est noble, c’est charmant_, you are goingyooto defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ... _C’estyoochevaleresque_.”yooyoo“Hold your tongue, I’ll kick you!”yooyoo“I shan’t be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained. If youyookick me, you must believe in my reality, for people don’t kick ghosts.yooJoking apart, it doesn’t matter to me, scold if you like, though it’syoobetter to be a trifle more polite even to me. ‘Fool, flunkey!’ whatyoowords!”yooyoo“Scolding you, I scold myself,” Ivan laughed again, “you are myself,yoomyself, only with a different face. You just say what I am thinking ...yooand are incapable of saying anything new!”yooyoo“If I am like you in my way of thinking, it’s all to my credit,” theyoogentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.yooyoo“You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what’s more, the stupid ones.yooYou are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid. No, I can’t put up withyooyou! What am I to do, what am I to do?” Ivan said through his clenchedyooteeth.yooyoo“My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman and toyoobe recognized as such,” the visitor began in an excess of deprecating andyoosimple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation. “I am poor, but ... Iyoowon’t say very honest, but ... it’s an axiom generally accepted in societyyoothat I am a fallen angel. I certainly can’t conceive how I can ever haveyoobeen an angel. If I ever was, it must have been so long ago that there’syoono harm in forgetting it. Now I only prize the reputation of being ayoogentlemanly person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable. Iyoolove men genuinely, I’ve been greatly calumniated! Here when I stay withyooyou from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality and that’s what Iyoolike most of all. You see, like you, I suffer from the fantastic and so Iyoolove the realism of earth. Here, with you, everything is circumscribed,yoohere all is formulated and geometrical, while we have nothing butyooindeterminate equations! I wander about here dreaming. I like dreaming.yooBesides, on earth I become superstitious. Please don’t laugh, that’s justyoowhat I like, to become superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: I’veyoogrown fond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I goyooand steam myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is becomingyooincarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some merchant’s wifeyooweighing eighteen stone, and of believing all she believes. My ideal is toyoogo to church and offer a candle in simple-hearted faith, upon my word ityoois. Then there would be an end to my sufferings. I like being doctoredyootoo; in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and wasyoovaccinated in a foundling hospital—if only you knew how I enjoyed myselfyoothat day. I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But youyooare not listening. Do you know, you are not at all well this evening? Iyooknow you went yesterday to that doctor ... well, what about your health?yooWhat did the doctor say?”yooyoo“Fool!” Ivan snapped out.yooyoo“But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn’t ask out ofyoosympathy. You needn’t answer. Now rheumatism has come in again—”yooyoo“Fool!” repeated Ivan.yooyoo“You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of rheumatismyoolast year that I remember it to this day.”yooyoo“The devil have rheumatism!”yooyoo“Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly form and Iyootake the consequences. Satan _sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto_.”yooyoo“What, what, Satan _sum et nihil humanum_ ... that’s not bad for theyoodevil!”yooyoo“I am glad I’ve pleased you at last.”yooyoo“But you didn’t get that from me.” Ivan stopped suddenly, seeming struck.yoo“That never entered my head, that’s strange.”yooyoo“_C’est du nouveau, n’est-ce pas?_ This time I’ll act honestly and explainyooto you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from indigestionyooor anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions, such complex andyooreal actuality, such events, even a whole world of events, woven into suchyooa plot, with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to theyoolast button on a cuff, as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented. Yet suchyoodreams are sometimes seen not by writers, but by the most ordinary people,yooofficials, journalists, priests.... The subject is a complete enigma. Ayoostatesman confessed to me, indeed, that all his best ideas came to himyoowhen he was asleep. Well, that’s how it is now, though I am youryoohallucination, yet just as in a nightmare, I say original things which hadyoonot entered your head before. So I don’t repeat your ideas, yet I am onlyyooyour nightmare, nothing more.”yooyoo“You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not myyoonightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.”yooyoo“My dear fellow, I’ve adopted a special method to-day, I’ll explain it toyooyou afterwards. Stay, where did I break off? Oh, yes! I caught cold then,yooonly not here but yonder.”yooyoo“Where is yonder? Tell me, will you be here long? Can’t you go away?” Ivanyooexclaimed almost in despair. He ceased walking to and fro, sat down on theyoosofa, leaned his elbows on the table again and held his head tight in bothyoohands. He pulled the wet towel off and flung it away in vexation. It wasyooevidently of no use.yooyoo“Your nerves are out of order,” observed the gentleman, with a carelesslyyooeasy, though perfectly polite, air. “You are angry with me even for beingyooable to catch cold, though it happened in a most natural way. I wasyoohurrying then to a diplomatic _soirée_ at the house of a lady of high rankyooin Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in the Ministry. Well, anyooevening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was God knows where and had toyoofly through space to reach your earth.... Of course, it took only anyooinstant, but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eightyoominutes, and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat. Spirits don’tyoofreeze, but when one’s in fleshly form, well ... in brief, I didn’t think,yooand set off, and you know in those ethereal spaces, in the water that isyooabove the firmament, there’s such a frost ... at least one can’t call ityoofrost, you can fancy, 150 degrees below zero! You know the game theyoovillage girls play—they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degreesyooof frost, the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skinyoooff, so it bleeds. But that’s only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I imagineyooit would be enough to put your finger on the ax and it would be the end ofyooit ... if only there could be an ax there.”yooyoo“And can there be an ax there?” Ivan interrupted, carelessly andyoodisdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in theyoodelusion and not to sink into complete insanity.yooyoo“An ax?” the guest interrupted in surprise.yooyoo“Yes, what would become of an ax there?” Ivan cried suddenly, with a sortyooof savage and insistent obstinacy.yooyoo“What would become of an ax in space? _Quelle idée!_ If it were to fall toyooany distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the earth withoutyooknowing why, like a satellite. The astronomers would calculate the risingyooand the setting of the ax, _Gatzuk_ would put it in his calendar, that’syooall.”yooyoo“You are stupid, awfully stupid,” said Ivan peevishly. “Fib more cleverlyyooor I won’t listen. You want to get the better of me by realism, toyooconvince me that you exist, but I don’t want to believe you exist! I won’tyoobelieve it!”yooyoo“But I am not fibbing, it’s all the truth; the truth is unhappily hardlyyooever amusing. I see you persist in expecting something big of me, andyooperhaps something fine. That’s a great pity, for I only give what I can—”yooyoo“Don’t talk philosophy, you ass!”yooyoo“Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am moaning andyoogroaning. I’ve tried all the medical faculty: they can diagnoseyoobeautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their finger-tips, butyoothey’ve no idea how to cure you. There was an enthusiastic little studentyoohere, ‘You may die,’ said he, ‘but you’ll know perfectly what disease youyooare dying of!’ And then what a way they have sending people toyoospecialists! ‘We only diagnose,’ they say, ‘but go to such-and-such ayoospecialist, he’ll cure you.’ The old doctor who used to cure all sorts ofyoodisease has completely disappeared, I assure you, now there are onlyyoospecialists and they all advertise in the newspapers. If anything is wrongyoowith your nose, they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a Europeanyoospecialist who cures noses. If you go to Paris, he’ll look at your nose; Iyoocan only cure your right nostril, he’ll tell you, for I don’t cure theyooleft nostril, that’s not my speciality, but go to Vienna, there there’s ayoospecialist who will cure your left nostril. What are you to do? I fellyooback on popular remedies, a German doctor advised me to rub myself withyoohoney and salt in the bath-house. Solely to get an extra bath I went,yoosmeared myself all over and it did me no good at all. In despair I wroteyooto Count Mattei in Milan. He sent me a book and some drops, bless him,yooand, only fancy, Hoff’s malt extract cured me! I bought it by accident,yoodrank a bottle and a half of it, and I was ready to dance, it took it awayyoocompletely. I made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him, I wasyooprompted by a feeling of gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of ayoobother: not a single paper would take my letter. ‘It would be veryyooreactionary,’ they said, ‘no one will believe it. _Le diable n’existeyoopoint._ You’d better remain anonymous,’ they advised me. What use is ayooletter of thanks if it’s anonymous? I laughed with the men at theyoonewspaper office; ‘It’s reactionary to believe in God in our days,’ Iyoosaid, ‘but I am the devil, so I may be believed in.’ ‘We quite understandyoothat,’ they said. ‘Who doesn’t believe in the devil? Yet it won’t do, ityoomight injure our reputation. As a joke, if you like.’ But I thought as ayoojoke it wouldn’t be very witty. So it wasn’t printed. And do you know, Iyoohave felt sore about it to this day. My best feelings, gratitude, foryooinstance, are literally denied me simply from my social position.”yooyoo“Philosophical reflections again?” Ivan snarled malignantly.yooyoo“God preserve me from it, but one can’t help complaining sometimes. I am ayooslandered man. You upbraid me every moment with being stupid. One can seeyooyou are young. My dear fellow, intelligence isn’t the only thing! I haveyoonaturally a kind and merry heart. ‘I also write vaudevilles of all sorts.’yooYou seem to take me for Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is a far moreyooserious one. Before time was, by some decree which I could never make out,yooI was pre-destined ‘to deny’ and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and notyooat all inclined to negation. ‘No, you must go and deny, without denialyoothere’s no criticism and what would a journal be without a column ofyoocriticism?’ Without criticism it would be nothing but one ‘hosannah.’ Butyoonothing but hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah must be tried inyoothe crucible of doubt and so on, in the same style. But I don’t meddle inyoothat, I didn’t create it, I am not answerable for it. Well, they’ve chosenyootheir scapegoat, they’ve made me write the column of criticism and so lifeyoowas made possible. We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply askyoofor annihilation. No, live, I am told, for there’d be nothing without you.yooIf everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would happen. Thereyoowould be no events without you, and there must be events. So against theyoograin I serve to produce events and do what’s irrational because I amyoocommanded to. For all their indisputable intelligence, men take this farceyooas something serious, and that is their tragedy. They suffer, of courseyoo... but then they live, they live a real life, not a fantastic one, foryoosuffering is life. Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it? Ityoowould be transformed into an endless church service; it would be holy, butyootedious. But what about me? I suffer, but still, I don’t live. I am x inyooan indeterminate equation. I am a sort of phantom in life who has lost allyoobeginning and end, and who has even forgotten his own name. You areyoolaughing— no, you are not laughing, you are angry again. You are for everyooangry, all you care about is intelligence, but I repeat again that I wouldyoogive away all this super-stellar life, all the ranks and honors, simply toyoobe transformed into the soul of a merchant’s wife weighing eighteen stoneyooand set candles at God’s shrine.”yooyoo“Then even you don’t believe in God?” said Ivan, with a smile of hatred.yooyoo“What can I say?—that is, if you are in earnest—”yooyoo“Is there a God or not?” Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.yooyoo“Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I don’t know.yooThere! I’ve said it now!”yooyoo“You don’t know, but you see God? No, you are not some one apart, you areyoomyself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish, you are my fancy!”yooyoo“Well, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would be true.yoo_Je pense, donc je suis_, I know that for a fact; all the rest, all theseyooworlds, God and even Satan—all that is not proved, to my mind. Does allyoothat exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of myself, a logicalyoodevelopment of my ego which alone has existed for ever: but I make hasteyooto stop, for I believe you will be jumping up to beat me directly.”yooyoo“You’d better tell me some anecdote!” said Ivan miserably.yooyoo“There is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend, not anyooanecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say, yet you don’tyoobelieve. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one like that. We are allyooin a muddle over there now and all through your science. Once there usedyooto be atoms, five senses, four elements, and then everything hung togetheryoosomehow. There were atoms in the ancient world even, but since we’veyoolearned that you’ve discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm andyoothe devil knows what, we had to lower our crest. There’s a regular muddle,yooand, above all, superstition, scandal; there’s as much scandal among us asyooamong you, you know; a little more in fact, and spying, indeed, for weyoohave our secret police department where private information is received.yooWell, this wild legend belongs to our middle ages—not yours, but ours—andyoono one believes it even among us, except the old ladies of eighteen stone,yoonot your old ladies I mean, but ours. We’ve everything you have, I amyoorevealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you; though it’syooforbidden. This legend is about Paradise. There was, they say, here onyooearth a thinker and philosopher. He rejected everything, ‘laws,yooconscience, faith,’ and, above all, the future life. He died; he expectedyooto go straight to darkness and death and he found a future life beforeyoohim. He was astounded and indignant. ‘This is against my principles!’ heyoosaid. And he was punished for that ... that is, you must excuse me, I amyoojust repeating what I heard myself, it’s only a legend ... he wasyoosentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark (we’ve adopted theyoometric system, you know) and when he has finished that quadrillion, theyoogates of heaven would be opened to him and he’ll be forgiven—”yooyoo“And what tortures have you in the other world besides the quadrillionyookilometers?” asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.yooyoo“What tortures? Ah, don’t ask. In old days we had all sorts, but now theyyoohave taken chiefly to moral punishments—‘the stings of conscience’ and allyoothat nonsense. We got that, too, from you, from the softening of youryoomanners. And who’s the better for it? Only those who have got noyooconscience, for how can they be tortured by conscience when they haveyoonone? But decent people who have conscience and a sense of honor sufferyoofor it. Reforms, when the ground has not been prepared for them,yooespecially if they are institutions copied from abroad, do nothing butyoomischief! The ancient fire was better. Well, this man, who was condemnedyooto the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and lay downyooacross the road. ‘I won’t go, I refuse on principle!’ Take the soul of anyooenlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the prophet Jonah,yoowho sulked for three days and nights in the belly of the whale, and youyooget the character of that thinker who lay across the road.”yooyoo“What did he lie on there?”yooyoo“Well, I suppose there was something to lie on. You are not laughing?”yooyoo“Bravo!” cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now he wasyoolistening with an unexpected curiosity. “Well, is he lying there now?”yooyoo“That’s the point, that he isn’t. He lay there almost a thousand years andyoothen he got up and went on.”yooyoo“What an ass!” cried Ivan, laughing nervously and still seeming to beyoopondering something intently. “Does it make any difference whether he liesyoothere for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers? It would take ayoobillion years to walk it?”yooyoo“Much more than that. I haven’t got a pencil and paper or I could work ityooout. But he got there long ago, and that’s where the story begins.”yooyoo“What, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to do it?”yooyoo“Why, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present earth mayyoohave been repeated a billion times. Why, it’s become extinct, been frozen;yoocracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into its elements, again ‘the wateryooabove the firmament,’ then again a comet, again a sun, again from the sunyooit becomes earth—and the same sequence may have been repeated endlesslyyooand exactly the same to every detail, most unseemly and insufferablyyootedious—”yooyoo“Well, well, what happened when he arrived?”yooyoo“Why, the moment the gates of Paradise were open and he walked in, beforeyoohe had been there two seconds, by his watch (though to my thinking hisyoowatch must have long dissolved into its elements on the way), he cried outyoothat those two seconds were worth walking not a quadrillion kilometers butyooa quadrillion of quadrillions, raised to the quadrillionth power! In fact,yoohe sang ‘hosannah’ and overdid it so, that some persons there of loftyyooideas wouldn’t shake hands with him at first—he’d become too rapidlyyooreactionary, they said. The Russian temperament. I repeat, it’s a legend.yooI give it for what it’s worth. So that’s the sort of ideas we have on suchyoosubjects even now.”yooyoo“I’ve caught you!” Ivan cried, with an almost childish delight, as thoughyoohe had succeeded in remembering something at last. “That anecdote aboutyoothe quadrillion years, I made up myself! I was seventeen then, I was atyoothe high school. I made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellowyoocalled Korovkin, it was at Moscow.... The anecdote is so characteristicyoothat I couldn’t have taken it from anywhere. I thought I’d forgotten ityoo... but I’ve unconsciously recalled it—I recalled it myself—it was not youyootelling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like thatyooeven when people are being taken to execution ... it’s come back to me inyooa dream. You are that dream! You are a dream, not a living creature!”yooyoo“From the vehemence with which you deny my existence,” laughed theyoogentleman, “I am convinced that you believe in me.”yooyoo“Not in the slightest! I haven’t a hundredth part of a grain of faith inyooyou!”yooyoo“But you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic doses perhaps are theyoostrongest. Confess that you have faith even to the ten-thousandth of ayoograin.”yooyoo“Not for one minute,” cried Ivan furiously. “But I should like to believeyooin you,” he added strangely.yooyoo“Aha! There’s an admission! But I am good-natured. I’ll come to youryooassistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you me. I told you youryooanecdote you’d forgotten, on purpose, so as to destroy your faith in meyoocompletely.”yooyoo“You are lying. The object of your visit is to convince me of youryooexistence!”yooyoo“Just so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief andyoodisbelief—is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as youyooare, that it’s better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you areyooinclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling youyoothat anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and I have myyoomotive in it. It’s the new method. As soon as you disbelieve in meyoocompletely, you’ll begin assuring me to my face that I am not a dream butyooa reality. I know you. Then I shall have attained my object, which is anyoohonorable one. I shall sow in you only a tiny grain of faith and it willyoogrow into an oak-tree—and such an oak-tree that, sitting on it, you willyoolong to enter the ranks of ‘the hermits in the wilderness and the saintlyyoowomen,’ for that is what you are secretly longing for. You’ll dine onyoolocusts, you’ll wander into the wilderness to save your soul!”yooyoo“Then it’s for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it, youyooscoundrel?”yooyoo“One must do a good work sometimes. How ill-humored you are!”yooyoo“Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and prayedyooseventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with moss?”yooyoo“My dear fellow, I’ve done nothing else. One forgets the whole world andyooall the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he is a veryyooprecious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes worth a wholeyooconstellation. We have our system of reckoning, you know. The conquest isyoopriceless! And some of them, on my word, are not inferior to you inyooculture, though you won’t believe it. They can contemplate such depths ofyoobelief and disbelief at the same moment that sometimes it really seemsyoothat they are within a hair’s-breadth of being ‘turned upside down,’ asyoothe actor Gorbunov says.”yooyoo“Well, did you get your nose pulled?”(8)yooyoo“My dear fellow,” observed the visitor sententiously, “it’s better to getyoooff with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an afflictedyoomarquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated by a specialist)yooin confession to his spiritual father—a Jesuit. I was present, it wasyoosimply charming. ‘Give me back my nose!’ he said, and he beat his breast.yoo‘My son,’ said the priest evasively, ‘all things are accomplished inyooaccordance with the inscrutable decrees of Providence, and what seems ayoomisfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary, though unapparent, benefits.yooIf stern destiny has deprived you of your nose, it’s to your advantageyoothat no one can ever pull you by your nose.’ ‘Holy father, that’s noyoocomfort,’ cried the despairing marquis. ‘I’d be delighted to have my noseyoopulled every day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.’ ‘Myyooson,’ sighs the priest, ‘you can’t expect every blessing at once. This isyoomurmuring against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you, foryooif you repine as you repined just now, declaring you’d be glad to haveyooyour nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has already beenyoofulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you were led by theyoonose.’ ”yooyoo“Fool, how stupid!” cried Ivan.yooyoo“My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that’s theyoogenuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word for word asyooI’ve told you. It happened lately and gave me a great deal of trouble. Theyoounhappy young man shot himself that very night when he got home. I was byyoohis side till the very last moment. Those Jesuit confessionals are reallyyoomy most delightful diversion at melancholy moments. Here’s anotheryooincident that happened only the other day. A little blonde Norman girl ofyootwenty—a buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouthyoowater—comes to an old priest. She bends down and whispers her sin into theyoograting. ‘Why, my daughter, have you fallen again already?’ cries theyoopriest. ‘O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not the same man this time, howyoolong is this going on? Aren’t you ashamed!’ ‘_Ah, mon père_,’ answers theyoosinner with tears of penitence, ‘_ça lui fait tant de plaisir, et à moi siyoopeu de peine!_’ Fancy, such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry ofyoonature, better than innocence itself, if you like. I absolved her sin onyoothe spot and was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. I heard theyoopriest at the grating making an appointment with her for theyooevening—though he was an old man hard as flint, he fell in an instant! Ityoowas nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights! What, you are turningyooup your nose again? Angry again? I don’t know how to please you—”yooyoo“Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting nightmare,”yooIvan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition. “I am bored withyooyou, agonizingly and insufferably. I would give anything to be able toyooshake you off!”yooyoo“I repeat, moderate your expectations, don’t demand of me ‘everythingyoogreat and noble’ and you’ll see how well we shall get on,” said theyoogentleman impressively. “You are really angry with me for not havingyooappeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and lightning, with scorchedyoowings, but have shown myself in such a modest form. You are wounded, inyoothe first place, in your esthetic feelings, and, secondly, in your pride.yooHow could such a vulgar devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there isyoothat romantic strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky. I can’tyoohelp it, young man, as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke ofyooappearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in theyooCaucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat. But I wasyoopositively afraid of doing it, for you’d have thrashed me for daring toyoopin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least, the Polar Staryooor the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am stupid, but, mercy on us! Iyoomake no claim to be equal to you in intelligence. Mephistopheles declaredyooto Faust that he desired evil, but did only good. Well, he can say what heyoolikes, it’s quite the opposite with me. I am perhaps the one man in allyoocreation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good. I was there whenyoothe Word, Who died on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosomyoothe soul of the penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubimyoosinging and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphimyoowhich shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you by all that’syoosacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all. Theyooword had almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips ... you knowyoohow susceptible and esthetically impressionable I am. But common sense—oh,yooa most unhappy trait in my character—kept me in due bounds and I let theyoomoment pass! For what would have happened, I reflected, what would haveyoohappened after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have beenyooextinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And so, solelyyoofrom a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced to suppress theyoogood moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody takes all the credityooof what’s good for Himself, and nothing but nastiness is left for me. ButyooI don’t envy the honor of a life of idle imposture, I am not ambitious.yooWhy am I, of all creatures in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decentyoopeople and even to be kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound toyootake such consequences sometimes? I know, of course, there’s a secret inyooit, but they won’t tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps,yooseeing the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the indispensableyoominus would disappear at once, and good sense would reign supremeyoothroughout the whole world. And that, of course, would mean the end ofyooeverything, even of magazines and newspapers, for who would take them in?yooI know that at the end of all things I shall be reconciled. I, too, shallyoowalk my quadrillion and learn the secret. But till that happens I amyoosulking and fulfill my destiny though it’s against the grain—that is, toyooruin thousands for the sake of saving one. How many souls have had to beyooruined and how many honorable reputations destroyed for the sake of thatyooone righteous man, Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days!yooYes, till the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths foryoome—one, their truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and theyooother my own. And there’s no knowing which will turn out the better....yooAre you asleep?”yooyoo“I might well be,” Ivan groaned angrily. “All my stupid ideas—outgrown,yoothrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead carcass—you present toyoome as something new!”yooyoo“There’s no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you by myyooliterary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasn’t bad, was it? Andyoothen that ironical tone _à la_ Heine, eh?”yooyoo“No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget a flunkeyyoolike you?”yooyoo“My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young Russianyoogentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature and art, theyooauthor of a promising poem entitled _The Grand Inquisitor_. I was onlyyoothinking of him!”yooyoo“I forbid you to speak of _The Grand Inquisitor_,” cried Ivan, crimsonyoowith shame.yooyoo“And the _Geological Cataclysm_. Do you remember? That was a poem, now!”yooyoo“Hold your tongue, or I’ll kill you!”yooyoo“You’ll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat myself toyoothat pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young friends, quiveringyoowith eagerness for life! ‘There are new men,’ you decided last spring,yoowhen you were meaning to come here, ‘they propose to destroy everythingyooand begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they didn’t ask my advice! Iyoomaintain that nothing need be destroyed, that we only need to destroy theyooidea of God in man, that’s how we have to set to work. It’s that, that weyoomust begin with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soonyooas men have all of them denied God—and I believe that period, analogousyoowith geological periods, will come to pass—the old conception of theyoouniverse will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what’s more, theyooold morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to take fromyoolife all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world.yooMan will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and theyooman-god will appear. From hour to hour extending his conquest of natureyooinfinitely by his will and his science, man will feel such lofty joy fromyoohour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams ofyoothe joys of heaven. Every one will know that he is mortal and will acceptyoodeath proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that it’syoouseless for him to repine at life’s being a moment, and he will love hisyoobrother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a momentyooof life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensifyyooits fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond theyoograve’... and so on and so on in the same style. Charming!”yooyooIvan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his ears,yoobut he began trembling all over. The voice continued.yooyoo“The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible that suchyooa period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined and humanityyoois settled for ever. But as, owing to man’s inveterate stupidity, thisyoocannot come about for at least a thousand years, every one who recognizesyoothe truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases, on theyoonew principles. In that sense, ‘all things are lawful’ for him. What’syoomore, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is anyway noyooGod and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even ifyoohe is the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position,yoohe may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of theyooold slave-man, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God stands,yoothe place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost place ...yoo‘all things are lawful’ and that’s the end of it! That’s all veryyoocharming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction foryoodoing it? But that’s our modern Russian all over. He can’t bring himselfyooto swindle without a moral sanction. He is so in love with truth—”yooyooThe visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence, speakingyoolouder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But he did notyoosucceed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from the table andyooflung it at the orator.yooyoo“_Ah, mais c’est bête enfin_,” cried the latter, jumping up from the sofayooand shaking the drops of tea off himself. “He remembers Luther’s inkstand!yooHe takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a dream! It’s like a woman!yooI suspected you were only pretending to stop up your ears.”yooyooA loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window. Ivan jumpedyooup from the sofa.yooyoo“Do you hear? You’d better open,” cried the visitor; “it’s your brotheryooAlyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I’ll be bound!”yooyoo“Be silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming, and ofyoocourse he has not come for nothing; of course he brings ‘news,’ ” Ivanyooexclaimed frantically.yooyoo“Open, open to him. There’s a snowstorm and he is your brother. _Monsieuryoosait-il le temps qu’il fait? C’est à ne pas mettre un chien dehors_.”yooyooThe knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but somethingyooseemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained every effort to break hisyoochains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew louder and louder. Atyoolast the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up from the sofa. He lookedyooround him wildly. Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he had justyoothrown at his visitor stood before him on the table, and there was no oneyooon the sofa opposite. The knocking on the window frame went onyoopersistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in hisyoodream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued.yooyoo“It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened justyoonow!” cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane.yooyoo“Alyosha, I told you not to come,” he cried fiercely to his brother. “Inyootwo words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?”yooyoo“An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,” Alyosha answered from the yard.yooyoo“Come round to the steps, I’ll open at once,” said Ivan, going to open theyoodoor to Alyosha.yooyooyooyooChapter X. “It Was He Who Said That”yooyooyooAlyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago MaryayooKondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had takenyoohis own life. “I went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on ayoonail in the wall.” On Alyosha’s inquiring whether she had informed theyoopolice, she answered that she had told no one, “but I flew straight toyooyou, I’ve run all the way.” She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported,yooand was shaking like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, heyoofound Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: “I destroy myyoolife of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on any one.”yooAlyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police captainyooand told him all about it. “And from him I’ve come straight to you,” saidyooAlyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan’s face. He had notyootaken his eyes off him while he told his story, as though struck byyoosomething in his expression.yooyoo“Brother,” he cried suddenly, “you must be terribly ill. You look andyoodon’t seem to understand what I tell you.”yooyoo“It’s a good thing you came,” said Ivan, as though brooding, and notyoohearing Alyosha’s exclamation. “I knew he had hanged himself.”yooyoo“From whom?”yooyoo“I don’t know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me. He told me so justyoonow.”yooyooIvan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same broodingyootone, looking at the ground.yooyoo“Who is _he_?” asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.yooyoo“He’s slipped away.”yooyooIvan raised his head and smiled softly.yooyoo“He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a ‘pure cherub.’ Dmitriyoocalls you a cherub. Cherub!... the thunderous rapture of the seraphim.yooWhat are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation. But perhaps thatyooconstellation is only a chemical molecule. There’s a constellation of theyooLion and the Sun. Don’t you know it?”yooyoo“Brother, sit down,” said Alyosha in alarm. “For goodness’ sake, sit downyooon the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow, that’s right.yooWould you like a wet towel on your head? Perhaps it will do you good.”yooyoo“Give me the towel: it’s here on the chair. I just threw it down there.”yooyoo“It’s not here. Don’t worry yourself. I know where it is—here,” saidyooAlyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused, by Ivan’syoodressing-table in the other corner of the room. Ivan looked strangely atyoothe towel: recollection seemed to come back to him for an instant.yooyoo“Stay”—he got up from the sofa—“an hour ago I took that new towel fromyoothere and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here ...yooHow is it it’s dry? There was no other.”yooyoo“You put that towel on your head?” asked Alyosha.yooyoo“Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the candlesyooburnt down so? What’s the time?”yooyoo“Nearly twelve.”yooyoo“No, no, no!” Ivan cried suddenly. “It was not a dream. He was here; heyoowas sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked at the window, I threw ayooglass at him ... this one. Wait a minute. I was asleep last time, but thisyoodream was not a dream. It has happened before. I have dreams now, Alyoshayoo... yet they are not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk and see ...yoothough I am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He isyoofrightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.” Ivan laughed suddenlyyooand began pacing about the room.yooyoo“Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?” Alyosha asked anxiouslyyooagain.yooyoo“The devil! He’s taken to visiting me. He’s been here twice, almost threeyootimes. He taunted me with being angry at his being a simple devil and notyooSatan, with scorched wings, in thunder and lightning. But he is not Satan:yoothat’s a lie. He is an impostor. He is simply a devil—a paltry, trivialyoodevil. He goes to the baths. If you undressed him, you’d be sure to findyoohe had a tail, long and smooth like a Danish dog’s, a yard long, dunyoocolor.... Alyosha, you are cold. You’ve been in the snow. Would you likeyoosome tea? What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her to bring some? _C’est à neyoopas mettre un chien dehors._...”yooyooAlyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded Ivan to sityoodown again, and put the wet towel round his head. He sat down beside him.yooyoo“What were you telling me just now about Lise?” Ivan began again. (He wasyoobecoming very talkative.) “I like Lise. I said something nasty about her.yooIt was a lie. I like her ... I am afraid for Katya to-morrow. I am moreyooafraid of her than of anything. On account of the future. She will cast meyoooff to-morrow and trample me under foot. She thinks that I am ruiningyooMitya from jealousy on her account! Yes, she thinks that! But it’s not so.yooTo-morrow the cross, but not the gallows. No, I shan’t hang myself. Do youyooknow, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha. Is it because I am base? I amyoonot a coward. Is it from love of life? How did I know that Smerdyakov hadyoohanged himself? Yes, it was _he_ told me so.”yooyoo“And you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?” askedyooAlyosha.yooyoo“Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him away. You didyoodrive him away: he disappeared when you arrived. I love your face,yooAlyosha. Did you know that I loved your face? And _he_ is myself, Alyosha.yooAll that’s base in me, all that’s mean and contemptible. Yes, I am ayooromantic. He guessed it ... though it’s a libel. He is frightfully stupid;yoobut it’s to his advantage. He has cunning, animal cunning—he knew how toyooinfuriate me. He kept taunting me with believing in him, and that was howyoohe made me listen to him. He fooled me like a boy. He told me a great dealyoothat was true about myself, though. I should never have owned it toyoomyself. Do you know, Alyosha,” Ivan added in an intensely earnest andyooconfidential tone, “I should be awfully glad to think that it was _he_ andyoonot I.”yooyoo“He has worn you out,” said Alyosha, looking compassionately at hisyoobrother.yooyoo“He’s been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so cleverly.yoo‘Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for myself. Why am Iyootormented by it? From habit. From the universal habit of mankind for theyooseven thousand years. So let us give it up, and we shall be gods.’ It wasyoohe said that, it was he said that!”yooyoo“And not you, not you?” Alyosha could not help crying, looking frankly atyoohis brother. “Never mind him, anyway; have done with him and forget him.yooAnd let him take with him all that you curse now, and never come back!”yooyoo“Yes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent, Alyosha,”yooIvan said, with a shudder of offense. “But he was unfair to me, unfair toyoome about lots of things. He told lies about me to my face. ‘Oh, you areyoogoing to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered youryoofather, that the valet murdered him at your instigation.’ ”yooyoo“Brother,” Alyosha interposed, “restrain yourself. It was not you murderedyoohim. It’s not true!”yooyoo“That’s what he says, he, and he knows it. ‘You are going to perform anyooact of heroic virtue, and you don’t believe in virtue; that’s whatyootortures you and makes you angry, that’s why you are so vindictive.’ Heyoosaid that to me about me and he knows what he says.”yooyoo“It’s you say that, not he,” exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, “and you say ityoobecause you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.”yooyoo“No, he knows what he says. ‘You are going from pride,’ he says. ‘You’llyoostand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you writhe with horror?yooYou are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your horror!’ He saidyoothat about me. ‘And do you know you are longing for their praise—“he is ayoocriminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul; he wanted to save hisyoobrother and he confessed.” ’ That’s a lie, Alyosha!” Ivan cried suddenly,yoowith flashing eyes. “I don’t want the low rabble to praise me, I swear Iyoodon’t! That’s a lie! That’s why I threw the glass at him and it brokeyooagainst his ugly face.”yooyoo“Brother, calm yourself, stop!” Alyosha entreated him.yooyoo“Yes, he knows how to torment one. He’s cruel,” Ivan went on, unheeding.yoo“I had an inkling from the first what he came for. ‘Granting that you goyoothrough pride, still you had a hope that Smerdyakov might be convicted andyoosent to Siberia, and Mitya would be acquitted, while you would only beyoopunished with moral condemnation’ (‘Do you hear?’ he laughed then)—‘andyoosome people will praise you. But now Smerdyakov’s dead, he has hangedyoohimself, and who’ll believe you alone? But yet you are going, you areyoogoing, you’ll go all the same, you’ve decided to go. What are you goingyoofor now?’ That’s awful, Alyosha. I can’t endure such questions. Who dareyooask me such questions?”yooyoo“Brother,” interposed Alyosha—his heart sank with terror, but he stillyooseemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason—“how could he have told you ofyooSmerdyakov’s death before I came, when no one knew of it and there was noyootime for any one to know of it?”yooyoo“He told me,” said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. “It was all heyoodid talk about, if you come to that. ‘And it would be all right if youyoobelieved in virtue,’ he said. ‘No matter if they disbelieve you, you areyoogoing for the sake of principle. But you are a little pig like FyodoryooPavlovitch, and what do you want with virtue? Why do you want to goyoomeddling if your sacrifice is of no use to any one? Because you don’t knowyooyourself why you go! Oh, you’d give a great deal to know yourself why youyoogo! And can you have made up your mind? You’ve not made up your mind.yooYou’ll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go;yooyou know you’ll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the decisionyoodoes not depend on you. You’ll go because you won’t dare not to go. Whyyoowon’t you dare? You must guess that for yourself. That’s a riddle foryooyou!’ He got up and went away. You came and he went. He called me ayoocoward, Alyosha! _Le mot de l’énigme_ is that I am a coward. ‘It is notyoofor such eagles to soar above the earth.’ It was he added that—he! AndyooSmerdyakov said the same. He must be killed! Katya despises me. I’ve seenyoothat for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! ‘You are goingyooin order to be praised.’ That’s a brutal lie! And you despise me too,yooAlyosha. Now I am going to hate you again! And I hate the monster, too! Iyoohate the monster! I don’t want to save the monster. Let him rot inyooSiberia! He’s begun singing a hymn! Oh, to-morrow I’ll go, stand beforeyoothem, and spit in their faces!”yooyooHe jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing up andyoodown the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just said. “I seem to beyoosleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.” It seemed toyoobe just like that now. Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passedyoothrough his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave hisyoobrother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degreesyooIvan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking,yootalking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated hisyoowords with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was inyootime to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressedyoohim somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another twoyoohours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring, breathing softly andyooevenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, withoutyooundressing.yooyooAs he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to understandyooIvan’s illness. “The anguish of a proud determination. An earnestyooconscience!” God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth were gainingyoomastery over his heart, which still refused to submit. “Yes,” the thoughtyoofloated through Alyosha’s head as it lay on the pillow, “yes, ifyooSmerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan’s evidence; but he will goyooand give it.” Alyosha smiled softly. “God will conquer!” he thought. “Heyoowill either rise up in the light of truth, or ... he’ll perish in hate,yoorevenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause he doesyoonot believe in,” Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.yooyooyooyooyooBook XII. A Judicial ErroryooyooyooyooChapter I. The Fatal DayyooyooyooAt ten o’clock in the morning of the day following the events I haveyoodescribed, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court.yooyooI hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capableyooof reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even inyoothe actual order of events. I imagine that to mention everything with fullyooexplanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust Iyoomay not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me. I may haveyooselected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and mayyoohave omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shallyoodo better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see foryoohimself that I have done all I can.yooyooAnd, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention whatyoosurprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later, every one wasyoosurprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had aroused greatyoointerest, that every one was burning with impatience for the trial toyoobegin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture, exclamation andyoosurmise for the last two months in local society. Every one knew, too,yoothat the case had become known throughout Russia, but yet we had notyooimagined that it had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in everyyooone, not only among ourselves, but all over Russia. This became evident atyoothe trial this day.yooyooVisitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province, butyoofrom several other Russian towns, as well as from Moscow and Petersburg.yooAmong them were lawyers, ladies, and even several distinguishedyoopersonages. Every ticket of admission had been snatched up. A specialyooplace behind the table at which the three judges sat was set apart for theyoomost distinguished and important of the men visitors; a row of arm-chairsyoohad been placed there—something exceptional, which had never been allowedyoobefore. A large proportion—not less than half of the public—were ladies.yooThere was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they did notyooknow where to seat them, for every ticket had long since been eagerlyyoosought for and distributed. I saw at the end of the room, behind theyooplatform, a special partition hurriedly put up, behind which all theseyoolawyers were admitted, and they thought themselves lucky to have standingyooroom there, for all chairs had been removed for the sake of space, and theyoocrowd behind the partition stood throughout the case closely packed,yooshoulder to shoulder.yooyooSome of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance, made theiryooappearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the majority of theyooladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces betrayed hysterical,yoointense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar fact—established afterwardsyooby many observations—was that almost all the ladies, or, at least the vastyoomajority of them, were on Mitya’s side and in favor of his beingyooacquitted. This was perhaps chiefly owing to his reputation as a conqueroryooof female hearts. It was known that two women rivals were to appear in theyoocase. One of them—Katerina Ivanovna—was an object of general interest. Allyoosorts of extraordinary tales were told about her, amazing anecdotes of heryoopassion for Mitya, in spite of his crime. Her pride and “aristocraticyooconnections” were particularly insisted upon (she had called upon scarcelyyooany one in the town). People said she intended to petition the Governmentyoofor leave to accompany the criminal to Siberia and to be married to himyoosomewhere in the mines. The appearance of Grushenka in court was awaitedyoowith no less impatience. The public was looking forward with anxiousyoocuriosity to the meeting of the two rivals—the proud aristocratic girl andyoo“the hetaira.” But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies ofyoothe district than Katerina Ivanovna. They had already seen “the woman whoyoohad ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son,” and all, almost withoutyooexception, wondered how father and son could be so in love with “such ayoovery common, ordinary Russian girl, who was not even pretty.”yooyooIn brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that thereyoowere several serious family quarrels on Mitya’s account in our town. Manyyooladies quarreled violently with their husbands over differences of opinionyooabout the dreadful case, and it was only natural that the husbands ofyoothese ladies, far from being favorably disposed to the prisoner, shouldyooenter the court bitterly prejudiced against him. In fact, one may sayyoopretty certainly that the masculine, as distinguished from the feminine,yoopart of the audience were biased against the prisoner. There were numbersyooof severe, frowning, even vindictive faces. Mitya, indeed, had managed toyoooffend many people during his stay in the town. Some of the visitors were,yooof course, in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate ofyooMitya personally. But all were interested in the trial, and the majorityyooof the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the criminal,yooexcept perhaps the lawyers, who were more interested in the legal than inyoothe moral aspect of the case.yooyooEverybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer,yooFetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was not the first timeyoohe had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces. And if heyoodefended them, such cases became celebrated and long remembered all overyooRussia. There were stories, too, about our prosecutor and about theyooPresident of the Court. It was said that Ippolit Kirillovitch was in ayootremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and that they had been enemies from theyoobeginning of their careers in Petersburg, that though our sensitiveyooprosecutor, who always considered that he had been aggrieved by some oneyooin Petersburg because his talents had not been properly appreciated, wasyookeenly excited over the Karamazov case, and was even dreaming ofyoorebuilding his flagging fortunes by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they said,yoowas his one anxiety. But these rumors were not quite just. Our prosecutoryoowas not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger. On theyoocontrary, his self-confidence increased with the increase of danger. Ityoomust be noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidlyyooimpressionable. He would put his whole soul into some case and work at ityooas though his whole fate and his whole fortune depended on its result.yooThis was the subject of some ridicule in the legal world, for just by thisyoocharacteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than could haveyoobeen expected from his modest position. People laughed particularly at hisyoopassion for psychology. In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutoryoowas, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally supposed.yooBut with his delicate health he had failed to make his mark at the outsetyooof his career and had never made up for it later.yooyooAs for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a humane andyoocultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his work and progressiveyooviews. He was rather ambitious, but did not concern himself greatly aboutyoohis future career. The great aim of his life was to be a man of advancedyooideas. He was, too, a man of connections and property. He felt, as weyoolearnt afterwards, rather strongly about the Karamazov case, but from ayoosocial, not from a personal standpoint. He was interested in it as ayoosocial phenomenon, in its classification and its character as a product ofyooour social conditions, as typical of the national character, and so on,yooand so on. His attitude to the personal aspect of the case, to its tragicyoosignificance and the persons involved in it, including the prisoner, wasyoorather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps fitting, indeed.yooyooThe court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made theiryooappearance. Our court is the best hall in the town—spacious, lofty, andyoogood for sound. On the right of the judges, who were on a raised platform,yooa table and two rows of chairs had been put ready for the jury. On theyooleft was the place for the prisoner and the counsel for the defense. Inyoothe middle of the court, near the judges, was a table with the “materialyooproofs.” On it lay Fyodor Pavlovitch’s white silk dressing-gown, stainedyoowith blood; the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had beenyoocommitted; Mitya’s shirt, with a blood-stained sleeve; his coat, stainedyoowith blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put hisyoohandkerchief; the handkerchief itself, stiff with blood and by now quiteyooyellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotin’s with a view to suicide,yooand taken from him on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon Borissovitch; theyooenvelope in which the three thousand roubles had been put ready foryooGrushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with which it had been tied, and manyyooother articles I don’t remember. In the body of the hall, at someyoodistance, came the seats for the public. But in front of the balustrade ayoofew chairs had been placed for witnesses who remained in the court afteryoogiving their evidence.yooyooAt ten o’clock the three judges arrived—the President, one honoraryyoojustice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of course, enteredyooimmediately after. The President was a short, stout, thick-set man ofyoofifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark hair turning gray and cut short,yooand a red ribbon, of what Order I don’t remember. The prosecutor struck meyooand the others, too, as looking particularly pale, almost green. His faceyooseemed to have grown suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for Iyoohad seen him looking as usual only two days before. The President beganyoowith asking the court whether all the jury were present.yooyooBut I see I can’t go on like this, partly because some things I did notyoohear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten, but most ofyooall because, as I have said before, I have literally no time or space toyoomention everything that was said and done. I only know that neither sideyooobjected to very many of the jurymen. I remember the twelve jurymen—fouryoowere petty officials of the town, two were merchants, and six peasants andyooartisans of the town. I remember, long before the trial, questions wereyoocontinually asked with some surprise, especially by ladies: “Can such ayoodelicate, complex and psychological case be submitted for decision toyoopetty officials and even peasants?” and “What can an official, still moreyooa peasant, understand in such an affair?” All the four officials in theyoojury were, in fact, men of no consequence and of low rank. Except one whoyoowas rather younger, they were gray-headed men, little known in society,yoowho had vegetated on a pitiful salary, and who probably had elderly,yoounpresentable wives and crowds of children, perhaps even without shoes andyoostockings. At most, they spent their leisure over cards and, of course,yoohad never read a single book. The two merchants looked respectable, butyoowere strangely silent and stolid. One of them was close-shaven, and wasyoodressed in European style; the other had a small, gray beard, and wore ayoored ribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on his neck. There is no needyooto speak of the artisans and the peasants. The artisans ofyooSkotoprigonyevsk are almost peasants, and even work on the land. Two ofyoothem also wore European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were dirtieryooand more uninviting-looking than the others. So that one might wellyoowonder, as I did as soon as I had looked at them, “what men like thatyoocould possibly make of such a case?” Yet their faces made a strangelyyooimposing, almost menacing, impression; they were stern and frowning.yooyooAt last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor PavlovitchyooKaramazov. I don’t quite remember how he described him. The court usheryoowas told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya made his appearance. Thereyoowas a hush through the court. One could have heard a fly. I don’t know howyooit was with others, but Mitya made a most unfavorable impression on me. Heyoolooked an awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat. I heard afterwards thatyoohe had ordered it in Moscow expressly for the occasion from his ownyootailor, who had his measure. He wore immaculate black kid gloves andyooexquisite linen. He walked in with his yard-long strides, looking stifflyyoostraight in front of him, and sat down in his place with a mostyoounperturbed air.yooyooAt the same moment the counsel for defense, the celebrated Fetyukovitch,yooentered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through the court. He was ayootall, spare man, with long thin legs, with extremely long, thin, paleyoofingers, clean-shaven face, demurely brushed, rather short hair, and thinyoolips that were at times curved into something between a sneer and a smile.yooHe looked about forty. His face would have been pleasant, if it had notyoobeen for his eyes, which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were setyooremarkably close together, with only the thin, long nose as a dividingyooline between them. In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike aboutyoohis face. He was in evening dress and white tie.yooyooI remember the President’s first questions to Mitya, about his name, hisyoocalling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice was soyoounexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look at theyooprisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who were to takeyoopart in the proceedings—that is, of the witnesses and experts. It was ayoolong list. Four of the witnesses were not present—Miüsov, who had givenyooevidence at the preliminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakovyooand Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through hisyoosudden death, of which an official statement from the police wasyoopresented. The news of Smerdyakov’s death produced a sudden stir andyoowhisper in the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not heard ofyoothe sudden suicide. What struck people most was Mitya’s sudden outburst Asyoosoon as the statement of Smerdyakov’s death was made, he cried out aloudyoofrom his place:yooyoo“He was a dog and died like a dog!”yooyooI remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President addressedyoohim, threatening to take stern measures, if such an irregularity wereyoorepeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice repeated several timesyooabruptly to his counsel, with no show of regret:yooyoo“I won’t again, I won’t. It escaped me. I won’t do it again.”yooyooAnd, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury or theyoopublic. His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself. It was underyoothe influence of this incident that the opening statement was read. It wasyoorather short, but circumstantial. It only stated the chief reasons why heyoohad been arrested, why he must be tried, and so on. Yet it made a greatyooimpression on me. The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The wholeyootragedy was suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, inyooa fatal and pitiless light. I remember how, immediately after it had beenyooread, the President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice:yooyoo“Prisoner, do you plead guilty?”yooyooMitya suddenly rose from his seat.yooyoo“I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,” he exclaimed, again in ayoostartling, almost frenzied, voice, “to idleness and debauchery. I meant toyoobecome an honest man for good, just at the moment when I was struck downyooby fate. But I am not guilty of the death of that old man, my enemy and myyoofather. No, no, I am not guilty of robbing him! I could not be. DmitriyooKaramazov is a scoundrel, but not a thief.”yooyooHe sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President againyoobriefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what was asked,yooand not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he ordered the caseyooto proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take the oath. Then I sawyoothem all together. The brothers of the prisoner were, however, allowed toyoogive evidence without taking the oath. After an exhortation from theyoopriest and the President, the witnesses were led away and were made to sityooas far as possible apart from one another. Then they began calling them upyooone by one.yooyooyooyooChapter II. Dangerous WitnessesyooyooyooI do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for theyooprosecution were separated into groups by the President, and whether ityoowas arranged to call them in a certain order. But no doubt it was so. Iyooonly know that the witnesses for the prosecution were called first. Iyoorepeat I don’t intend to describe all the questions step by step. Besides,yoomy account would be to some extent superfluous, because in the speechesyoofor the prosecution and for the defense the whole course of the evidenceyoowas brought together and set in a strong and significant light, and I tookyoodown parts of those two remarkable speeches in full, and will quote themyooin due course, together with one extraordinary and quite unexpectedyooepisode, which occurred before the final speeches, and undoubtedlyyooinfluenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial.yooyooI will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one peculiaryoocharacteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by all, that is,yoothe overwhelming strength of the prosecution as compared with theyooarguments the defense had to rely upon. Every one realized it from theyoofirst moment that the facts began to group themselves round a singleyoopoint, and the whole horrible and bloody crime was gradually revealed.yooEvery one, perhaps, felt from the first that the case was beyond dispute,yoothat there was no doubt about it, that there could be really noyoodiscussion, and that the defense was only a matter of form, and that theyooprisoner was guilty, obviously and conclusively guilty. I imagine thatyooeven the ladies, who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of theyoointeresting prisoner, were at the same time, without exception, convincedyooof his guilt. What’s more, I believe they would have been mortified if hisyooguilt had not been so firmly established, as that would have lessened theyooeffect of the closing scene of the criminal’s acquittal. That he would beyooacquitted, all the ladies, strange to say, were firmly persuaded up to theyoovery last moment. “He is guilty, but he will be acquitted, from motives ofyoohumanity, in accordance with the new ideas, the new sentiments that hadyoocome into fashion,” and so on, and so on. And that was why they hadyoocrowded into the court so impatiently. The men were more interested in theyoocontest between the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch. All wereyoowondering and asking themselves what could even a talent likeyooFetyukovitch’s make of such a desperate case; and so they followed hisyooachievements, step by step, with concentrated attention.yooyooBut Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end, up to hisyoospeech. Persons of experience suspected that he had some design, that heyoowas working towards some object, but it was almost impossible to guessyoowhat it was. His confidence and self-reliance were unmistakable, however.yooEvery one noticed with pleasure, moreover, that he, after so short a stay,yoonot more than three days, perhaps, among us, had so wonderfully succeededyooin mastering the case and “had studied it to a nicety.” People describedyoowith relish, afterwards, how cleverly he had “taken down” all theyoowitnesses for the prosecution, and as far as possible perplexed them and,yoowhat’s more, had aspersed their reputation and so depreciated the value ofyootheir evidence. But it was supposed that he did this rather by way ofyoosport, so to speak, for professional glory, to show nothing had beenyooomitted of the accepted methods, for all were convinced that he could doyoono real good by such disparagement of the witnesses, and probably was moreyooaware of this than any one, having some idea of his own in the background,yoosome concealed weapon of defense, which he would suddenly reveal when theyootime came. But meanwhile, conscious of his strength, he seemed to beyoodiverting himself.yooyooSo, for instance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s old servant, who hadyoogiven the most damning piece of evidence about the open door, wasyooexamined, the counsel for the defense positively fastened upon him whenyoohis turn came to question him. It must be noted that Grigory entered theyoohall with a composed and almost stately air, not the least disconcerted byyoothe majesty of the court or the vast audience listening to him. He gaveyooevidence with as much confidence as though he had been talking with hisyooMarfa, only perhaps more respectfully. It was impossible to make himyoocontradict himself. The prosecutor questioned him first in detail aboutyoothe family life of the Karamazovs. The family picture stood out in luridyoocolors. It was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless andyooimpartial. In spite of his profound reverence for the memory of hisyoodeceased master, he yet bore witness that he had been unjust to Mitya andyoo“hadn’t brought up his children as he should. He’d have been devoured byyoolice when he was little, if it hadn’t been for me,” he added, describingyooMitya’s early childhood. “It wasn’t fair either of the father to wrong hisyooson over his mother’s property, which was by right his.”yooyooIn reply to the prosecutor’s question what grounds he had for assertingyoothat Fyodor Pavlovitch had wronged his son in their money relations,yooGrigory, to the surprise of every one, had no proof at all to bringyooforward, but he still persisted that the arrangement with the son wasyoo“unfair,” and that he ought “to have paid him several thousand roublesyoomore.” I must note, by the way, that the prosecutor asked this questionyoowhether Fyodor Pavlovitch had really kept back part of Mitya’s inheritanceyoowith marked persistence of all the witnesses who could be asked it, notyooexcepting Alyosha and Ivan, but he obtained no exact information from anyyooone; all alleged that it was so, but were unable to bring forward anyyoodistinct proof. Grigory’s description of the scene at the dinner-table,yoowhen Dmitri had burst in and beaten his father, threatening to come backyooto kill him, made a sinister impression on the court, especially as theyooold servant’s composure in telling it, his parsimony of words and peculiaryoophraseology, were as effective as eloquence. He observed that he was notyooangry with Mitya for having knocked him down and struck him on the face;yoohe had forgiven him long ago, he said. Of the deceased Smerdyakov heyooobserved, crossing himself, that he was a lad of ability, but stupid andyooafflicted, and, worse still, an infidel, and that it was Fyodor Pavlovitchyooand his elder son who had taught him to be so. But he defendedyooSmerdyakov’s honesty almost with warmth, and related how Smerdyakov hadyooonce found the master’s money in the yard, and, instead of concealing it,yoohad taken it to his master, who had rewarded him with a “gold piece” foryooit, and trusted him implicitly from that time forward. He maintainedyooobstinately that the door into the garden had been open. But he was askedyooso many questions that I can’t recall them all.yooyooAt last the counsel for the defense began to cross-examine him, and theyoofirst question he asked was about the envelope in which Fyodor Pavlovitchyoowas supposed to have put three thousand roubles for “a certain person.”yoo“Have you ever seen it, you, who were for so many years in closeyooattendance on your master?” Grigory answered that he had not seen it andyoohad never heard of the money from any one “till everybody was talkingyooabout it.” This question about the envelope Fetyukovitch put to every oneyoowho could conceivably have known of it, as persistently as the prosecutoryooasked his question about Dmitri’s inheritance, and got the same answeryoofrom all, that no one had seen the envelope, though many had heard of it.yooFrom the beginning every one noticed Fetyukovitch’s persistence on thisyoosubject.yooyoo“Now, with your permission I’ll ask you a question,” Fetyukovitch said,yoosuddenly and unexpectedly. “Of what was that balsam, or, rather,yoodecoction, made, which, as we learn from the preliminary inquiry, you usedyooon that evening to rub your lumbago, in the hope of curing it?”yooyooGrigory looked blankly at the questioner, and after a brief silenceyoomuttered, “There was saffron in it.”yooyoo“Nothing but saffron? Don’t you remember any other ingredient?”yooyoo“There was milfoil in it, too.”yooyoo“And pepper perhaps?” Fetyukovitch queried.yooyoo“Yes, there was pepper, too.”yooyoo“Etcetera. And all dissolved in vodka?”yooyoo“In spirit.”yooyooThere was a faint sound of laughter in the court.yooyoo“You see, in spirit. After rubbing your back, I believe, you drank whatyoowas left in the bottle with a certain pious prayer, only known to youryoowife?”yooyoo“I did.”yooyoo“Did you drink much? Roughly speaking, a wine-glass or two?”yooyoo“It might have been a tumbler-full.”yooyoo“A tumbler-full, even. Perhaps a tumbler and a half?”yooyooGrigory did not answer. He seemed to see what was meant.yooyoo“A glass and a half of neat spirit—is not at all bad, don’t you think? Youyoomight see the gates of heaven open, not only the door into the garden?”yooyooGrigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court. TheyooPresident made a movement.yooyoo“Do you know for a fact,” Fetyukovitch persisted, “whether you were awakeyooor not when you saw the open door?”yooyoo“I was on my legs.”yooyoo“That’s not a proof that you were awake.” (There was again laughter in theyoocourt.) “Could you have answered at that moment, if any one had asked youyooa question—for instance, what year it is?”yooyoo“I don’t know.”yooyoo“And what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?”yooyooGrigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his tormentor.yooStrange to say, it appeared he really did not know what year it was.yooyoo“But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands?”yooyoo“I am a servant,” Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct voice. “Ifyoomy betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty to suffer it.”yooyooFetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President intervened,yooreminding him that he must ask more relevant questions. Fetyukovitch bowedyoowith dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the witness.yooThe public and the jury, of course, were left with a grain of doubt inyootheir minds as to the evidence of a man who might, while undergoing ayoocertain cure, have seen “the gates of heaven,” and who did not even knowyoowhat year he was living in. But before Grigory left the box anotheryooepisode occurred. The President, turning to the prisoner, asked himyoowhether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness.yooyoo“Except about the door, all he has said is true,” cried Mitya, in a loudyoovoice. “For combing the lice off me, I thank him; for forgiving my blows,yooI thank him. The old man has been honest all his life and as faithful toyoomy father as seven hundred poodles.”yooyoo“Prisoner, be careful in your language,” the President admonished him.yooyoo“I am not a poodle,” Grigory muttered.yooyoo“All right, it’s I am a poodle myself,” cried Mitya. “If it’s an insult, Iyootake it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and cruel to him. Iyoowas cruel to Æsop too.”yooyoo“What Æsop?” the President asked sternly again.yooyoo“Oh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.”yooyooThe President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very sternlyyooto be more careful in his language.yooyoo“You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.”yooyooThe counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with theyooevidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leadingyoowitnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance. Ityooappeared that he knew everything; his knowledge was amazing, he had beenyooeverywhere, seen everything, talked to everybody, knew every detail of theyoobiography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, ityoois true, he had only heard from Mitya himself. But he described minutelyyooMitya’s exploits in the “Metropolis,” all his compromising doings andyoosayings, and told the story of Captain Snegiryov’s “wisp of tow.” But evenyooRakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya’s inheritance, and confinedyoohimself to contemptuous generalities.yooyoo“Who could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in debt to theyooother, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no oneyoocould make head or tail of it?” He attributed the tragic crime to theyoohabits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressedyoocondition of Russia, due to the lack of appropriate institutions. He was,yooin fact, allowed some latitude of speech. This was the first occasion onyoowhich Rakitin showed what he could do, and attracted notice. Theyooprosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a magazine article on theyoocase, and afterwards in his speech, as we shall see later, quoted someyooideas from the article, showing that he had seen it already. The pictureyoodrawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one, and greatlyyoostrengthened the case for the prosecution. Altogether, Rakitin’s discourseyoofascinated the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobilityyooof its ideas. There were even two or three outbreaks of applause when heyoospoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia.yooyooBut Rakitin, in his youthful ardor, made a slight blunder, of which theyoocounsel for the defense at once adroitly took advantage. Answering certainyooquestions about Grushenka, and carried away by the loftiness of his ownyoosentiments and his success, of which he was, of course, conscious, he wentyooso far as to speak somewhat contemptuously of Agrafena Alexandrovna asyoo“the kept mistress of Samsonov.” He would have given a good deal to takeyooback his words afterwards, for Fetyukovitch caught him out over it atyooonce. And it was all because Rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer havingyoobeen able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so shortyooa time.yooyoo“Allow me to ask,” began the counsel for the defense, with the mostyooaffable and even respectful smile, “you are, of course, the same Mr.yooRakitin whose pamphlet, _The Life of the Deceased Elder, Father Zossima_,yoopublished by the diocesan authorities, full of profound and religiousyooreflections and preceded by an excellent and devout dedication to theyoobishop, I have just read with such pleasure?”yooyoo“I did not write it for publication ... it was published afterwards,”yoomuttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully disconcerted and almostyooashamed.yooyoo“Oh, that’s excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought to, takeyoothe widest view of every social question. Your most instructive pamphletyoohas been widely circulated through the patronage of the bishop, and hasyoobeen of appreciable service.... But this is the chief thing I should likeyooto learn from you. You stated just now that you were very intimatelyyooacquainted with Madame Svyetlov.” (It must be noted that Grushenka’syoosurname was Svyetlov. I heard it for the first time that day, during theyoocase.)yooyoo“I cannot answer for all my acquaintances.... I am a young man ... and whoyoocan be responsible for every one he meets?” cried Rakitin, flushing allyooover.yooyoo“I understand, I quite understand,” cried Fetyukovitch, as though he, too,yoowere embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself. “You, like any other,yoomight well be interested in an acquaintance with a young and beautifulyoowoman who would readily entertain the _élite_ of the youth of theyooneighborhood, but ... I only wanted to know ... It has come to myyooknowledge that Madame Svyetlov was particularly anxious a couple of monthsyooago to make the acquaintance of the younger Karamazov, AlexeyyooFyodorovitch, and promised you twenty-five roubles, if you would bring himyooto her in his monastic dress. And that actually took place on the eveningyooof the day on which the terrible crime, which is the subject of theyoopresent investigation, was committed. You brought Alexey Karamazov toyooMadame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty-five roubles from MadameyooSvyetlov as a reward, that’s what I wanted to hear from you?”yooyoo“It was a joke.... I don’t see of what interest that can be to you.... Iyootook it for a joke ... meaning to give it back later....”yooyoo“Then you did take— But you have not given it back yet ... or have you?”yooyoo“That’s of no consequence,” muttered Rakitin, “I refuse to answer suchyooquestions.... Of course I shall give it back.”yooyooThe President intervened, but Fetyukovitch declared he had no moreyooquestions to ask of the witness. Mr. Rakitin left the witness-box notyooabsolutely without a stain upon his character. The effect left by theyoolofty idealism of his speech was somewhat marred, and Fetyukovitch’syooexpression, as he watched him walk away, seemed to suggest to the publicyoo“this is a specimen of the lofty-minded persons who accuse him.” Iyooremember that this incident, too, did not pass off without an outbreakyoofrom Mitya. Enraged by the tone in which Rakitin had referred toyooGrushenka, he suddenly shouted “Bernard!” When, after Rakitin’syoocross-examination, the President asked the prisoner if he had anything toyoosay, Mitya cried loudly:yooyoo“Since I’ve been arrested, he has borrowed money from me! He is ayoocontemptible Bernard and opportunist, and he doesn’t believe in God; heyootook the bishop in!”yooyooMitya, of course, was pulled up again for the intemperance of hisyoolanguage, but Rakitin was done for. Captain Snegiryov’s evidence was ayoofailure, too, but from quite a different reason. He appeared in ragged andyoodirty clothes, muddy boots, and in spite of the vigilance and expertyooobservation of the police officers, he turned out to be hopelessly drunk.yooOn being asked about Mitya’s attack upon him, he refused to answer.yooyoo“God bless him. Ilusha told me not to. God will make it up to me yonder.”yooyoo“Who told you not to tell? Of whom are you talking?”yooyoo“Ilusha, my little son. ‘Father, father, how he insulted you!’ He saidyoothat at the stone. Now he is dying....”yooyooThe captain suddenly began sobbing, and plumped down on his knees beforeyoothe President. He was hurriedly led away amidst the laughter of theyoopublic. The effect prepared by the prosecutor did not come off at all.yooyooFetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity, and amazedyoopeople more and more by his minute knowledge of the case. Thus, foryooexample, Trifon Borissovitch made a great impression, of course, veryyooprejudicial to Mitya. He calculated almost on his fingers that on hisyoofirst visit to Mokroe, Mitya must have spent three thousand roubles, “oryoovery little less. Just think what he squandered on those gypsy girlsyooalone! And as for our lousy peasants, it wasn’t a case of flinging half ayoorouble in the street, he made them presents of twenty-five roubles each,yooat least, he didn’t give them less. And what a lot of money was simplyyoostolen from him! And if any one did steal, he did not leave a receipt. Howyoocould one catch the thief when he was flinging his money away all theyootime? Our peasants are robbers, you know; they have no care for theiryoosouls. And the way he went on with the girls, our village girls! They’reyoocompletely set up since then, I tell you, they used to be poor.” Heyoorecalled, in fact, every item of expense and added it all up. So theyootheory that only fifteen hundred had been spent and the rest had been putyooaside in a little bag seemed inconceivable.yooyoo“I saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his hands, I saw it with myyooown eyes; I should think I ought to know how to reckon money,” criedyooTrifon Borissovitch, doing his best to satisfy “his betters.”yooyooWhen Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him, he scarcely tried to refuteyoohis evidence, but began asking him about an incident at the first carousalyooat Mokroe, a month before the arrest, when Timofey and another peasantyoocalled Akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred roublesyoodropped by Mitya when he was drunk, and had given them to TrifonyooBorissovitch and received a rouble each from him for doing so. “Well,”yooasked the lawyer, “did you give that hundred roubles back to Mr.yooKaramazov?” Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain.... He was obliged, afteryoothe peasants had been examined, to admit the finding of the hundredyooroubles, only adding that he had religiously returned it all to DmitriyooFyodorovitch “in perfect honesty, and it’s only because his honor was inyooliquor at the time, he wouldn’t remember it.” But, as he had denied theyooincident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called to proveyooit, his evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was naturally regardedyoowith great suspicion. So one of the most dangerous witnesses broughtyooforward by the prosecution was again discredited.yooyooThe same thing happened with the Poles. They took up an attitude of prideyooand independence; they vociferated loudly that they had both been in theyooservice of the Crown, and that “Pan Mitya” had offered them three thousandyoo“to buy their honor,” and that they had seen a large sum of money in hisyoohands. Pan Mussyalovitch introduced a terrible number of Polish words intoyoohis sentences, and seeing that this only increased his consequence in theyooeyes of the President and the prosecutor, grew more and more pompous, andyooended by talking in Polish altogether. But Fetyukovitch caught them, too,yooin his snares. Trifon Borissovitch, recalled, was forced, in spite of hisyooevasions, to admit that Pan Vrublevsky had substituted another pack ofyoocards for the one he had provided, and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheatedyooduring the game. Kalganov confirmed this, and both the Poles left theyoowitness-box with damaged reputations, amidst laughter from the public.yooyooThen exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most dangerousyoowitnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on all of them, andyoodismissing them with a certain derision. The lawyers and experts were lostyooin admiration, and were only at a loss to understand what good purposeyoocould be served by it, for all, I repeat, felt that the case for theyooprosecution could not be refuted, but was growing more and more tragicallyyoooverwhelming. But from the confidence of the “great magician” they sawyoothat he was serene, and they waited, feeling that “such a man” had notyoocome from Petersburg for nothing, and that he was not a man to returnyoounsuccessful.yooyooyooyooChapter III. The Medical Experts And A Pound Of NutsyooyooyooThe evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to theyooprisoner. And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not reckoned muchyooupon it. The medical line of defense had only been taken up through theyooinsistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent for a celebrated doctor fromyooMoscow on purpose. The case for the defense could, of course, lose nothingyooby it and might, with luck, gain something from it. There was, however, anyooelement of comedy about it, through the difference of opinion of theyoodoctors. The medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, ouryoodoctor, Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. The two latteryooappeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.yooyooThe first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor Herzenstube.yooHe was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle height and sturdyyoobuild. He was much esteemed and respected by every one in the town. He wasyooa conscientious doctor and an excellent and pious man, a Hernguter oryooMoravian brother, I am not quite sure which. He had been living amongst usyoofor many years and behaved with wonderful dignity. He was a kind-heartedyooand humane man. He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing, visitedyoothem in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine, but he was asyooobstinate as a mule. If once he had taken an idea into his head, there wasyoono shaking it. Almost every one in the town was aware, by the way, thatyoothe famous doctor had, within the first two or three days of his presenceyooamong us, uttered some extremely offensive allusions to DoctoryooHerzenstube’s qualifications. Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty-fiveyooroubles for a visit, several people in the town were glad to takeyooadvantage of his arrival, and rushed to consult him regardless of expense.yooAll these had, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube,yooand the celebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extremeyooharshness. Finally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw them,yoo“Well, who has been cramming you with nostrums? Herzenstube? He, he!”yooDoctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this, and now all the threeyoodoctors made their appearance, one after another, to be examined.yooyooDoctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the prisoner’syoomental faculties was self-evident. Then giving his grounds for thisyooopinion, which I omit here, he added that the abnormality was not onlyyooevident in many of the prisoner’s actions in the past, but was apparentyooeven now at this very moment. When he was asked to explain how it wasyooapparent now at this moment, the old doctor, with simple-heartedyoodirectness, pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had “anyooextraordinary air, remarkable in the circumstances”; that he had “marchedyooin like a soldier, looking straight before him, though it would have beenyoomore natural for him to look to the left where, among the public, theyooladies were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sexyooand must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him now,” theyooold man concluded in his peculiar language.yooyooI must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was formed inyooGerman style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it had always beenyooa weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian perfectly, betteryooindeed than Russians. And he was very fond of using Russian proverbs,yooalways declaring that the Russian proverbs were the best and mostyooexpressive sayings in the whole world. I may remark, too, that inyooconversation, through absent-mindedness he often forgot the most ordinaryyoowords, which sometimes went out of his head, though he knew themyooperfectly. The same thing happened, though, when he spoke German, and atyoosuch times he always waved his hand before his face as though trying toyoocatch the lost word, and no one could induce him to go on speaking till heyoohad found the missing word. His remark that the prisoner ought to haveyoolooked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement in theyooaudience. All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor; they knew, too,yoothat having been all his life a bachelor and a religious man of exemplaryyooconduct, he looked upon women as lofty creatures. And so his unexpectedyooobservation struck every one as very queer.yooyooThe Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely andyooemphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner’s mental conditionyooabnormal in the highest degree. He talked at length and with erudition ofyoo“aberration” and “mania,” and argued that, from all the facts collected,yoothe prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of aberration for severalyoodays before his arrest, and, if the crime had been committed by him, ityoomust, even if he were conscious of it, have been almost involuntary, as heyoohad not the power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him.yooyooBut apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania, whichyoopremised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the future. (Ityoomust be noted that I report this in my own words, the doctor made use ofyoovery learned and professional language.) “All his actions are inyoocontravention of common sense and logic,” he continued. “Not to refer toyoowhat I have not seen, that is, the crime itself and the whole catastrophe,yoothe day before yesterday, while he was talking to me, he had anyoounaccountably fixed look in his eye. He laughed unexpectedly when thereyoowas nothing to laugh at. He showed continual and inexplicableyooirritability, using strange words, ‘Bernard!’ ‘Ethics!’ and others equallyyooinappropriate.” But the doctor detected mania, above all, in the fact thatyoothe prisoner could not even speak of the three thousand roubles, of whichyoohe considered himself to have been cheated, without extraordinaryyooirritation, though he could speak comparatively lightly of otheryoomisfortunes and grievances. According to all accounts, he had even in theyoopast, whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was touched on,yooflown into a perfect frenzy, and yet he was reported to be a disinterestedyooand not grasping man.yooyoo“As to the opinion of my learned colleague,” the Moscow doctor addedyooironically in conclusion, “that the prisoner would, on entering the court,yoohave naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him, I willyooonly say that, apart from the playfulness of this theory, it is radicallyyoounsound. For though I fully agree that the prisoner, on entering the courtyoowhere his fate will be decided, would not naturally look straight beforeyoohim in that fixed way, and that that may really be a sign of his abnormalyoomental condition, at the same time I maintain that he would naturally notyoolook to the left at the ladies, but, on the contrary, to the right to findyoohis legal adviser, on whose help all his hopes rest and on whose defenseyooall his future depends.” The doctor expressed his opinion positively andyooemphatically.yooyooBut the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the last touchyooof comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts. In his opinionyoothe prisoner was now, and had been all along, in a perfectly normalyoocondition, and, although he certainly must have been in a nervous andyooexceedingly excited state before his arrest, this might have been due toyooseveral perfectly obvious causes, jealousy, anger, continual drunkenness,yooand so on. But this nervous condition would not involve the mentalyooaberration of which mention had just been made. As to the question whetheryoothe prisoner should have looked to the left or to the right on enteringyoothe court, “in his modest opinion,” the prisoner would naturally lookyoostraight before him on entering the court, as he had in fact done, as thatyoowas where the judges, on whom his fate depended, were sitting. So that ityoowas just by looking straight before him that he showed his perfectlyyoonormal state of mind at the present. The young doctor concluded hisyoo“modest” testimony with some heat.yooyoo“Bravo, doctor!” cried Mitya, from his seat, “just so!”yooyooMitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctor’s opinion had ayoodecisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as appearedyooafterwards, every one agreed with him. But Doctor Herzenstube, when calledyooas a witness, was quite unexpectedly of use to Mitya. As an old residentyooin the town who had known the Karamazov family for years, he furnishedyoosome facts of great value for the prosecution, and suddenly, as thoughyoorecalling something, he added:yooyoo“But the poor young man might have had a very different life, for he had ayoogood heart both in childhood and after childhood, that I know. But theyooRussian proverb says, ‘If a man has one head, it’s good, but if anotheryooclever man comes to visit him, it would be better still, for then thereyoowill be two heads and not only one.’ ”yooyoo“One head is good, but two are better,” the prosecutor put in impatiently.yooHe knew the old man’s habit of talking slowly and deliberately, regardlessyooof the impression he was making and of the delay he was causing, andyoohighly prizing his flat, dull and always gleefully complacent German wit.yooThe old man was fond of making jokes.yooyoo“Oh, yes, that’s what I say,” he went on stubbornly. “One head is good,yoobut two are much better, but he did not meet another head with wits, andyoohis wits went. Where did they go? I’ve forgotten the word.” He went on,yoopassing his hand before his eyes, “Oh, yes, _spazieren_.”yooyoo“Wandering?”yooyoo“Oh, yes, wandering, that’s what I say. Well, his wits went wandering andyoofell in such a deep hole that he lost himself. And yet he was a gratefulyooand sensitive boy. Oh, I remember him very well, a little chap so high,yooleft neglected by his father in the back yard, when he ran about withoutyooboots on his feet, and his little breeches hanging by one button.”yooyooA note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest old man’syoovoice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though scenting something, andyoocaught at it instantly.yooyoo“Oh, yes, I was a young man then.... I was ... well, I was forty-fiveyoothen, and had only just come here. And I was so sorry for the boy then; Iyooasked myself why shouldn’t I buy him a pound of ... a pound of what? I’veyooforgotten what it’s called. A pound of what children are very fond of,yoowhat is it, what is it?” The doctor began waving his hands again. “Ityoogrows on a tree and is gathered and given to every one....”yooyoo“Apples?”yooyoo“Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound.... No, there are ayoolot of them, and all little. You put them in the mouth and crack.”yooyoo“Nuts?”yooyoo“Quite so, nuts, I say so.” The doctor repeated in the calmest way asyoothough he had been at no loss for a word. “And I bought him a pound ofyoonuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound of nuts before. And Iyoolifted my finger and said to him, ‘Boy, _Gott der Vater_.’ He laughed andyoosaid, ‘_Gott der Vater_.’... ‘_Gott der Sohn_.’ He laughed again andyoolisped, ‘_Gott der Sohn_.’ ‘_Gott der heilige Geist_.’ Then he laughed andyoosaid as best he could, ‘_Gott der heilige Geist_.’ I went away, and twoyoodays after I happened to be passing, and he shouted to me of himself,yoo‘Uncle, _Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_,’ and he had only forgotten ‘_Gottyooder heilige Geist_.’ But I reminded him of it and I felt very sorry foryoohim again. But he was taken away, and I did not see him again.yooTwenty-three years passed. I am sitting one morning in my study, ayoowhite-haired old man, when there walks into the room a blooming young man,yoowhom I should never have recognized, but he held up his finger and said,yoolaughing, ‘_Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_, and _Gott der heilige Geist_.yooI have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts, foryoono one else ever bought me a pound of nuts; you are the only one that everyoodid.’ And then I remembered my happy youth and the poor child in the yard,yoowithout boots on his feet, and my heart was touched and I said, ‘You are ayoograteful young man, for you have remembered all your life the pound ofyoonuts I bought you in your childhood.’ And I embraced him and blessed him.yooAnd I shed tears. He laughed, but he shed tears, too ... for the Russianyoooften laughs when he ought to be weeping. But he did weep; I saw it. Andyoonow, alas!...”yooyoo“And I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you saintly man,”yooMitya cried suddenly.yooyooIn any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on theyoopublic. But the chief sensation in Mitya’s favor was created by theyooevidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe directly. Indeed,yoowhen the witnesses _à décharge_, that is, called by the defense, beganyoogiving evidence, fortune seemed all at once markedly more favorable toyooMitya, and what was particularly striking, this was a surprise even to theyoocounsel for the defense. But before Katerina Ivanovna was called, Alyoshayoowas examined, and he recalled a fact which seemed to furnish positiveyooevidence against one important point made by the prosecution.yooyooyooyooChapter IV. Fortune Smiles On MityayooyooyooIt came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was not requiredyooto take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed him very gentlyyooand sympathetically. It was evident that his reputation for goodness hadyoopreceded him. Alyosha gave his evidence modestly and with restraint, butyoohis warm sympathy for his unhappy brother was unmistakable. In answer toyooone question, he sketched his brother’s character as that of a man,yooviolent-tempered perhaps and carried away by his passions, but at the sameyootime honorable, proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, ifyoonecessary. He admitted, however, that, through his passion for Grushenkayooand his rivalry with his father, his brother had been of late in anyoointolerable position. But he repelled with indignation the suggestion thatyoohis brother might have committed a murder for the sake of gain, though heyoorecognized that the three thousand roubles had become almost an obsessionyoowith Mitya; that he looked upon them as part of the inheritance he hadyoobeen cheated of by his father, and that, indifferent as he was to money asyooa rule, he could not even speak of that three thousand without fury. Asyoofor the rivalry of the two “ladies,” as the prosecutor expressed it—thatyoois, of Grushenka and Katya—he answered evasively and was even unwilling toyooanswer one or two questions altogether.yooyoo“Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill your father?”yooasked the prosecutor. “You can refuse to answer if you think necessary,”yoohe added.yooyoo“He did not tell me so directly,” answered Alyosha.yooyoo“How so? Did he indirectly?”yooyoo“He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear that at anyooextreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might perhaps murder him.”yooyoo“And you believed him?”yooyoo“I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some higheryoofeeling would always save him at the fatal moment, as it has indeed savedyoohim, for it was not he killed my father,” Alyosha said firmly, in a loudyoovoice that was heard throughout the court.yooyooThe prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet.yooyoo“Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity of youryooconviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your affection foryooyour unhappy brother. Your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode isyooknown to us already from the preliminary investigation. I won’t attempt toyooconceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all theyooother evidence collected by the prosecution. And so I think it essentialyooto press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of youryoobrother’s innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom youyoogave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?”yooyoo“I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,”yooreplied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. “I made no accusation againstyooSmerdyakov of myself.”yooyoo“Yet you gave evidence against him?”yooyoo“I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri’s words. I was told what tookyooplace at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov before I wasyooexamined. I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if heyoodidn’t commit the murder, then—”yooyoo“Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely persuadedyooof your brother’s innocence?”yooyoo“I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn’t lie to me. I sawyoofrom his face he wasn’t lying.”yooyoo“Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?”yooyoo“I have no other proof.”yooyoo“And of Smerdyakov’s guilt you have no proof whatever but your brother’syooword and the expression of his face?”yooyoo“No, I have no other proof.”yooyooThe prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression leftyooby Alyosha’s evidence on the public was most disappointing. There had beenyootalk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard something, someyooone had pointed out something else, it was said that Alyosha had gatheredyootogether some extraordinary proofs of his brother’s innocence andyooSmerdyakov’s guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence exceptyoocertain moral convictions so natural in a brother.yooyooBut Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination. On his asking Alyosha whenyooit was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred for his father andyoothat he might kill him, and whether he had heard it, for instance, atyootheir last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha started as he answered,yooas though only just recollecting and understanding something.yooyoo“I remember one circumstance now which I’d quite forgotten myself. Ityoowasn’t clear to me at the time, but now—”yooyooAnd, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he recountedyooeagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that evening under the tree,yooon the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck himself on the breast, “theyooupper part of the breast,” and had repeated several times that he had ayoomeans of regaining his honor, that that means was here, here on hisyoobreast. “I thought, when he struck himself on the breast, he meant that ityoowas in his heart,” Alyosha continued, “that he might find in his heartyoostrength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting himyooand which he did not dare confess even to me. I must confess I did thinkyooat the time that he was speaking of our father, and that the disgrace heyoowas shuddering at was the thought of going to our father and doing someyooviolence to him. Yet it was just then that he pointed to something on hisyoobreast, so that I remember the idea struck me at the time that the heartyoois not on that part of the breast, but below, and that he struck himselfyoomuch too high, just below the neck, and kept pointing to that place. Myyooidea seemed silly to me at the time, but he was perhaps pointing then toyoothat little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles!”yooyoo“Just so,” Mitya cried from his place. “That’s right, Alyosha, it was theyoolittle bag I struck with my fist.”yooyooFetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep quiet, and atyoothe same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried away himself by hisyoorecollection, warmly expressed his theory that this disgrace was probablyyoojust that fifteen hundred roubles on him, which he might have returned toyooKaterina Ivanovna as half of what he owed her, but which he had yetyoodetermined not to repay her and to use for another purpose—namely, toyooenable him to elope with Grushenka, if she consented.yooyoo“It is so, it must be so,” exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement. “Myyoobrother cried several times that half of the disgrace, half of it (he saidyoo_half_ several times) he could free himself from at once, but that he wasyooso unhappy in his weakness of will that he wouldn’t do it ... that he knewyoobeforehand he was incapable of doing it!”yooyoo“And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself just on thisyoopart of the breast?” Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.yooyoo“Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, ‘Why does he strikeyoohimself up there when the heart is lower down?’ and the thought seemedyoostupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming stupid ... it flashedyoothrough my mind. That’s what brought it back to me just now. How could Iyoohave forgotten it till now? It was that little bag he meant when he saidyoohe had the means but wouldn’t give back that fifteen hundred. And when heyoowas arrested at Mokroe he cried out—I know, I was told it—that heyooconsidered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he had theyoomeans of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he owed her,yoohe yet could not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remainyooa thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And what torture, whatyootorture that debt has been to him!” Alyosha exclaimed in conclusion.yooyooThe prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to describe onceyoomore how it had all happened, and several times insisted on the question,yoo“Had the prisoner seemed to point to anything? Perhaps he had simplyyoostruck himself with his fist on the breast?”yooyoo“But it was not with his fist,” cried Alyosha; “he pointed with hisyoofingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have so completelyyooforgotten it till this moment?”yooyooThe President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last witness’syooevidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been pointing to theyoofifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast, just below the neck, andyoothat that was, of course, the disgrace, “A disgrace I cannot deny, theyoomost shameful act of my whole life,” cried Mitya. “I might have repaid ityooand didn’t repay it. I preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather thanyoogive it back. And the most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehandyooI shouldn’t give it back! You are right, Alyosha! Thanks, Alyosha!”yooyooSo Alyosha’s cross-examination ended. What was important and strikingyooabout it was that one fact at least had been found, and even though thisyoowere only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence, it did goyoosome little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had containedyoofifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been lying at theyoopreliminary inquiry when he alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundredyooroubles were “his own.” Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he movedyooaway to the seat assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself: “How wasyooit I forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come back toyoome now?”yooyooKaterina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she entered somethingyooextraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched their lorgnettesyooand opera-glasses. There was a stir among the men: some stood up to get ayoobetter view. Everybody alleged afterwards that Mitya had turned “white asyooa sheet” on her entrance. All in black, she advanced modestly, almostyootimidly. It was impossible to tell from her face that she was agitated;yoobut there was a resolute gleam in her dark and gloomy eyes. I may remarkyoothat many people mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at thatyoomoment. She spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over theyoocourt. She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appearyoocomposed. The President began his examination discreetly and veryyoorespectfully, as though afraid to touch on “certain chords,” and showingyooconsideration for her great unhappiness. But in answer to one of the firstyooquestions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerlyyoobetrothed to the prisoner, “until he left me of his own accord...” sheyooadded quietly. When they asked her about the three thousand she hadyooentrusted to Mitya to post to her relations, she said firmly, “I didn’tyoogive him the money simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he wasyooin great need of money.... I gave him the three thousand on theyoounderstanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to.yooThere was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.”yooyooI will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers inyoodetail. I will only give the substance of her evidence.yooyoo“I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he gotyoomoney from his father,” she went on. “I have never doubted hisyoodisinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in moneyyoomatters. He felt quite certain that he would receive the money from hisyoofather, and spoke to me several times about it. I knew he had a feud withyoohis father and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated byyoohis father. I don’t remember any threat uttered by him against his father.yooHe certainly never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come to meyooat that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety about thatyoounlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up coming to see me ...yooand I myself was put in such a position ... that I could not inviteyoohim.... And I had no right, indeed, to be exacting as to that money,” sheyooadded suddenly, and there was a ring of resolution in her voice. “I wasyooonce indebted to him for assistance in money for more than three thousand,yooand I took it, although I could not at that time foresee that I shouldyooever be in a position to repay my debt.”yooyooThere was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then Fetyukovitch beganyoohis cross-examination.yooyoo“Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your acquaintance?”yooFetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way, instantly scentingyoosomething favorable. I must mention in parenthesis that, thoughyooFetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg partly at the instance ofyooKaterina Ivanovna herself, he knew nothing about the episode of the fouryoothousand roubles given her by Mitya, and of her “bowing to the ground toyoohim.” She concealed this from him and said nothing about it, and that wasyoostrange. It may be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did not knowyootill the very last minute whether she would speak of that episode in theyoocourt, and waited for the inspiration of the moment.yooyooNo, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her story. Sheyootold everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told Alyosha, and heryoobowing to the ground, and her reason. She told about her father and heryoogoing to Mitya, and did not in one word, in a single hint, suggest thatyooMitya had himself, through her sister, proposed they should “send himyooKaterina Ivanovna” to fetch the money. She generously concealed that andyoowas not ashamed to make it appear as though she had of her own impulse runyooto the young officer, relying on something ... to beg him for the money.yooIt was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I listened. Theyoocourt was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was something unexampled.yooEven from such a self-willed and contemptuously proud girl as she was,yoosuch an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice, such self-immolation,yooseemed incredible. And for what, for whom? To save the man who hadyoodeceived and insulted her and to help, in however small a degree, inyoosaving him, by creating a strong impression in his favor. And, indeed, theyoofigure of the young officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocentyoogirl, handed her his last four thousand roubles—all he had in theyooworld—was thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but ... Iyoohad a painful misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might come of ityoolater (and it did, in fact, it did). It was repeated all over the townyooafterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was perhaps not quiteyoocomplete—that is, in the statement that the officer had let the young ladyyoodepart “with nothing but a respectful bow.” It was hinted that somethingyoowas here omitted.yooyoo“And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole story,” theyoomost highly respected of our ladies maintained, “even then it’s veryyoodoubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl to behave in that way,yooeven for the sake of saving her father.”yooyooAnd can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbidyoosensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like that?yooShe must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to tell everything.yooOf course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the truth of her storyyooonly arose afterwards and at the first moment all were deeply impressed byyooit. As for the judges and the lawyers, they listened in reverent, almostyooshame-faced silence to Katerina Ivanovna. The prosecutor did not ventureyooupon even one question on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her.yooOh, he was almost triumphant! Much ground had been gained. For a man toyoogive his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the sameyooman to murder his father for the sake of robbing him of three thousand—theyooidea seemed too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt that now the charge ofyootheft, at least, was as good as disproved. “The case” was thrown intoyooquite a different light. There was a wave of sympathy for Mitya. As foryoohim.... I was told that once or twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was givingyooher evidence, he jumped up from his seat, sank back again, and hid hisyooface in his hands. But when she had finished, he suddenly cried in ayoosobbing voice:yooyoo“Katya, why have you ruined me?” and his sobs were audible all over theyoocourt. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried again:yooyoo“Now I am condemned!”yooyooThen he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his armsyooacross his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and sat down inyooher place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast down. Those who wereyoositting near her declared that for a long time she shivered all over asyoothough in a fever. Grushenka was called.yooyooI am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the final causeyooof Mitya’s ruin. For I am convinced, so is every one—all the lawyers saidyoothe same afterwards—that if the episode had not occurred, the prisoneryoowould at least have been recommended to mercy. But of that later. A fewyoowords first about Grushenka.yooyooShe, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent black shawlyooon her shoulders. She walked to the witness-box with her smooth, noiselessyootread, with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full figure. Sheyoolooked steadily at the President, turning her eyes neither to the rightyoonor to the left. To my thinking she looked very handsome at that moment,yooand not at all pale, as the ladies alleged afterwards. They declared, too,yoothat she had a concentrated and spiteful expression. I believe that sheyoowas simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous andyooinquisitive eyes of our scandal-loving public. She was proud and could notyoostand contempt. She was one of those people who flare up, angry and eageryooto retaliate, at the mere suggestion of contempt. There was an element ofyootimidity, too, of course, and inward shame at her own timidity, so it wasyoonot strange that her tone kept changing. At one moment it was angry,yoocontemptuous and rough, and at another there was a sincere note ofyooself-condemnation. Sometimes she spoke as though she were taking ayoodesperate plunge; as though she felt, “I don’t care what happens, I’ll sayyooit....” Apropos of her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she remarkedyoocurtly, “That’s all nonsense, and was it my fault that he would pesteryoome?” But a minute later she added, “It was all my fault. I was laughing atyoothem both—at the old man and at him, too—and I brought both of them toyoothis. It was all on account of me it happened.”yooyooSamsonov’s name came up somehow. “That’s nobody’s business,” she snappedyooat once, with a sort of insolent defiance. “He was my benefactor; he tookyoome when I hadn’t a shoe to my foot, when my family had turned me out.” TheyooPresident reminded her, though very politely, that she must answer theyooquestions directly, without going off into irrelevant details. Grushenkayoocrimsoned and her eyes flashed.yooyooThe envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only heardyoofrom “that wicked wretch” that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an envelope withyoonotes for three thousand in it. “But that was all foolishness. I was onlyyoolaughing. I wouldn’t have gone to him for anything.”yooyoo“To whom are you referring as ‘that wicked wretch’?” inquired theyooprosecutor.yooyoo“The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged himself lastyoonight.”yooyooShe was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such a definiteyooaccusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds for it.yooyoo“Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him. The womanyoowho came between us has ruined him; she is the cause of it all, let meyootell you,” Grushenka added. She seemed to be quivering with hatred, andyoothere was a vindictive note in her voice.yooyooShe was again asked to whom she was referring.yooyoo“The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me, offered meyoochocolate, tried to fascinate me. There’s not much true shame about her, Iyoocan tell you that....”yooyooAt this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to moderateyooher language. But the jealous woman’s heart was burning, and she did notyoocare what she did.yooyoo“When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,” the prosecutor asked, “everyyooone saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry out: ‘It’s all myyoofault. We’ll go to Siberia together!’ So you already believed him to haveyoomurdered his father?”yooyoo“I don’t remember what I felt at the time,” answered Grushenka. “Every oneyoowas crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt that it was myyoofault, that it was on my account he had murdered him. But when he said heyoowasn’t guilty, I believed him at once, and I believe him now and alwaysyooshall believe him. He is not the man to tell a lie.”yooyooFetyukovitch began his cross-examination. I remember that among otheryoothings he asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five roubles “you paid himyoofor bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.”yooyoo“There was nothing strange about his taking the money,” sneered Grushenka,yoowith angry contempt. “He was always coming to me for money: he used to getyoothirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he hadyooenough to keep him without my help.”yooyoo“What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?” Fetyukovitch asked, inyoospite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.yooyoo“Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother’s sister. But he’s alwaysyoobesought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully ashamed ofyoome.”yooyooThis fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor inyoothe monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told that Rakitin turnedyoopurple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard before sheyoocame into the court that he had given evidence against Mitya, and so sheyoowas angry. The whole effect on the public, of Rakitin’s speech, of hisyoonoble sentiments, of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorderyooof Russia, was this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: ityoowas another godsend. Grushenka’s cross-examination did not last long and,yooof course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence. Sheyooleft a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds ofyoocontemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her evidenceyooand sat down again in the court, at a good distance from KaterinayooIvanovna. Mitya was silent throughout her evidence. He sat as thoughyooturned to stone, with his eyes fixed on the ground.yooyooIvan was called to give evidence.yooyooyooyooChapter V. A Sudden CatastropheyooyooyooI may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the usher of theyoocourt announced to the President that, owing to an attack of illness oryoosome sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the moment, but wasyooready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered. But no one seemed toyoohave heard it and it only came out later.yooyooHis entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The principalyoowitnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been questioned.yooCuriosity was satisfied for the time; the public was feeling almostyoofatigued. Several more witnesses were still to be heard, who probably hadyoolittle information to give after all that had been given. Time wasyoopassing. Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness, looking at no one,yooand with his head bowed, as though plunged in gloomy thought. He wasyooirreproachably dressed, but his face made a painful impression, on me atyooleast: there was an earthy look in it, a look like a dying man’s. His eyesyoowere lusterless; he raised them and looked slowly round the court. Alyoshayoojumped up from his seat and moaned “Ah!” I remember that, but it wasyoohardly noticed.yooyooThe President began by informing him that he was a witness not on oath,yoothat he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of course, he mustyoobear witness according to his conscience, and so on, and so on. Ivanyoolistened and looked at him blankly, but his face gradually relaxed into ayoosmile, and as soon as the President, looking at him in astonishment,yoofinished, he laughed outright.yooyoo“Well, and what else?” he asked in a loud voice.yooyooThere was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something strange.yooThe President showed signs of uneasiness.yooyoo“You ... are perhaps still unwell?” he began, looking everywhere for theyoousher.yooyoo“Don’t trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and can tellyooyou something interesting,” Ivan answered with sudden calmness andyoorespectfulness.yooyoo“You have some special communication to make?” the President went on,yoostill mistrustfully.yooyooIvan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head, answered,yooalmost stammering:yooyoo“No ... I haven’t. I have nothing particular.”yooyooThey began asking him questions. He answered, as it were, reluctantly,yoowith extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew more and moreyoomarked, though he answered rationally. To many questions he answered thatyoohe did not know. He knew nothing of his father’s money relations withyooDmitri. “I wasn’t interested in the subject,” he added. Threats to murderyoohis father he had heard from the prisoner. Of the money in the envelope heyoohad heard from Smerdyakov.yooyoo“The same thing over and over again,” he interrupted suddenly, with a lookyooof weariness. “I have nothing particular to tell the court.”yooyoo“I see you are unwell and understand your feelings,” the President began.yooyooHe turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to invite themyooto examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly asked in anyooexhausted voice:yooyoo“Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill.”yooyooAnd with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned to walkyooout of the court. But after taking four steps he stood still, as though heyoohad reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back.yooyoo“I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know. How does it go?yoo‘I’ll stand up if I like, and I won’t if I don’t.’ They were trying to putyooon her sarafan to take her to church to be married, and she said, ‘I’llyoostand up if I like, and I won’t if I don’t.’... It’s in some book aboutyoothe peasantry.”yooyoo“What do you mean by that?” the President asked severely.yooyoo“Why, this,” Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. “Here’s the moneyyoo... the notes that lay in that envelope” (he nodded towards the table onyoowhich lay the material evidence), “for the sake of which our father wasyoomurdered. Where shall I put them? Mr. Superintendent, take them.”yooyooThe usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the President.yooyoo“How could this money have come into your possession if it is the sameyoomoney?” the President asked wonderingly.yooyoo“I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday.... I was withyoohim just before he hanged himself. It was he, not my brother, killed ouryoofather. He murdered him and I incited him to do it ... Who doesn’t desireyoohis father’s death?”yooyoo“Are you in your right mind?” broke involuntarily from the President.yooyoo“I should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty mind as all ofyooyou ... as all these ... ugly faces.” He turned suddenly to the audience.yoo“My father has been murdered and they pretend they are horrified,” heyoosnarled, with furious contempt. “They keep up the sham with one another.yooLiars! They all desire the death of their fathers. One reptile devoursyooanother.... If there hadn’t been a murder, they’d have been angry and goneyoohome ill-humored. It’s a spectacle they want! _Panem et circenses_. ThoughyooI am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink for Christ’s sake!”yooHe suddenly clutched his head.yooyooThe usher at once approached him. Alyosha jumped up and cried, “He is ill.yooDon’t believe him: he has brain fever.” Katerina Ivanovna rose impulsivelyyoofrom her seat and, rigid with horror, gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up andyoogreedily looked at his brother and listened to him with a wild, strangeyoosmile.yooyoo“Don’t disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,” Ivan beganyooagain. “You can’t expect eloquence from a murderer,” he added suddenly foryoosome reason and laughed a queer laugh.yooyooThe prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay. The two otheryoojudges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch pricked up his earsyooas he listened: the hall was hushed in expectation. The President seemedyoosuddenly to recollect himself.yooyoo“Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here. Calmyooyourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really have somethingyooto tell. How can you confirm your statement ... if indeed you are notyoodelirious?”yooyoo“That’s just it. I have no proof. That cur Smerdyakov won’t send youyooproofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You think of nothing butyooenvelopes—one is enough. I’ve no witnesses ... except one, perhaps,” heyoosmiled thoughtfully.yooyoo“Who is your witness?”yooyoo“He has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular! _Le diableyoon’existe point!_ Don’t pay attention: he is a paltry, pitiful devil,” heyooadded suddenly. He ceased laughing and spoke as it were, confidentially.yoo“He is here somewhere, no doubt—under that table with the materialyooevidence on it, perhaps. Where should he sit if not there? You see, listenyooto me. I told him I don’t want to keep quiet, and he talked about theyoogeological cataclysm ... idiocy! Come, release the monster ... he’s beenyoosinging a hymn. That’s because his heart is light! It’s like a drunken manyooin the street bawling how ‘Vanka went to Petersburg,’ and I would give ayooquadrillion quadrillions for two seconds of joy. You don’t know me! Oh,yoohow stupid all this business is! Come, take me instead of him! I didn’tyoocome for nothing.... Why, why is everything so stupid?...”yooyooAnd he began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round him again.yooBut the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha rushed towards him, butyoothe court usher had already seized Ivan by the arm.yooyoo“What are you about?” he cried, staring into the man’s face, and suddenlyyooseizing him by the shoulders, he flung him violently to the floor. But theyoopolice were on the spot and he was seized. He screamed furiously. And allyoothe time he was being removed, he yelled and screamed somethingyooincoherent.yooyooThe whole court was thrown into confusion. I don’t remember everything asyooit happened. I was excited myself and could not follow. I only know thatyooafterwards, when everything was quiet again and every one understood whatyoohad happened, the court usher came in for a reprimand, though he veryyooreasonably explained that the witness had been quite well, that the doctoryoohad seen him an hour ago, when he had a slight attack of giddiness, butyoothat, until he had come into the court, he had talked quite consecutively,yooso that nothing could have been foreseen—that he had, in fact, insisted onyoogiving evidence. But before every one had completely regained theiryoocomposure and recovered from this scene, it was followed by another.yooKaterina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics. She sobbed, shriekingyooloudly, but refused to leave the court, struggled, and besought them notyooto remove her. Suddenly she cried to the President:yooyoo“There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here is ayoodocument, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly! It’s a letteryoofrom that monster ... that man there, there!” she pointed to Mitya. “Ityoowas he killed his father, you will see that directly. He wrote to me howyoohe would kill his father! But the other one is ill, he is ill, he isyoodelirious!” she kept crying out, beside herself.yooyooThe court usher took the document she held out to the President, and she,yoodropping into her chair, hiding her face in her hands, began convulsivelyyooand noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and stifling every sound foryoofear she should be ejected from the court. The document she had handed upyoowas that letter Mitya had written at the “Metropolis” tavern, which Ivanyoohad spoken of as a “mathematical proof.” Alas! its mathematicalyooconclusiveness was recognized, and had it not been for that letter, Mityayoomight have escaped his doom or, at least, that doom would have been lessyooterrible. It was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail. Whatyoofollowed is still confused to my mind. The President must, I suppose, haveyooat once passed on the document to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers onyooboth sides. I only remember how they began examining the witness. On beingyoogently asked by the President whether she had recovered sufficiently,yooKaterina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously:yooyoo“I am ready, I am ready! I am quite equal to answering you,” she added,yooevidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented from givingyooevidence. She was asked to explain in detail what this letter was andyoounder what circumstances she received it.yooyoo“I received it the day before the crime was committed, but he wrote it theyooday before that, at the tavern—that is, two days before he committed theyoocrime. Look, it is written on some sort of bill!” she cried breathlessly.yoo“He hated me at that time, because he had behaved contemptibly and wasyoorunning after that creature ... and because he owed me that threeyoothousand.... Oh! he was humiliated by that three thousand on account ofyoohis own meanness! This is how it happened about that three thousand. I begyooyou, I beseech you, to hear me. Three weeks before he murdered his father,yoohe came to me one morning. I knew he was in want of money, and what heyoowanted it for. Yes, yes—to win that creature and carry her off. I knewyoothen that he had been false to me and meant to abandon me, and it was I,yooI, who gave him that money, who offered it to him on the pretext of hisyoosending it to my sister in Moscow. And as I gave it him, I looked him inyoothe face and said that he could send it when he liked, ‘in a month’s timeyoowould do.’ How, how could he have failed to understand that I wasyoopractically telling him to his face, ‘You want money to be false to meyoowith your creature, so here’s the money for you. I give it to you myself.yooTake it, if you have so little honor as to take it!’ I wanted to proveyoowhat he was, and what happened? He took it, he took it, and squandered ityoowith that creature in one night.... But he knew, he knew that I knew allyooabout it. I assure you he understood, too, that I gave him that money toyootest him, to see whether he was so lost to all sense of honor as to takeyooit from me. I looked into his eyes and he looked into mine, and heyoounderstood it all and he took it—he carried off my money!”yooyoo“That’s true, Katya,” Mitya roared suddenly, “I looked into your eyes andyooI knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your money. Despise meyooas a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I’ve deserved it!”yooyoo“Prisoner,” cried the President, “another word and I will order you to beyooremoved.”yooyoo“That money was a torment to him,” Katya went on with impulsive haste. “Heyoowanted to repay it me. He wanted to, that’s true; but he needed money foryoothat creature, too. So he murdered his father, but he didn’t repay me, andyoowent off with her to that village where he was arrested. There, again, heyoosquandered the money he had stolen after the murder of his father. And ayooday before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was drunk when he wroteyooit. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from spite, and feelingyoocertain, positively certain, that I should never show it to any one, evenyooif he did kill him, or else he wouldn’t have written it. For he knew Iyooshouldn’t want to revenge myself and ruin him! But read it, read ityooattentively—more attentively, please—and you will see that he hadyoodescribed it all in his letter, all beforehand, how he would kill hisyoofather and where his money was kept. Look, please, don’t overlook that,yoothere’s one phrase there, ‘I shall kill him as soon as Ivan has goneyooaway.’ So he thought it all out beforehand how he would kill him,”yooKaterina Ivanovna pointed out to the court with venomous and malignantyootriumph. Oh! it was clear she had studied every line of that letter andyoodetected every meaning underlining it. “If he hadn’t been drunk, heyoowouldn’t have written to me; but, look, everything is written thereyoobeforehand, just as he committed the murder after. A complete program ofyooit!” she exclaimed frantically.yooyooShe was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no doubt, sheyoohad foreseen them even a month ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking withyooanger, she had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not. Now sheyoohad taken the fatal plunge. I remember that the letter was read aloud byyoothe clerk, directly afterwards, I believe. It made an overwhelmingyooimpression. They asked Mitya whether he admitted having written theyooletter.yooyoo“It’s mine, mine!” cried Mitya. “I shouldn’t have written it, if I hadn’tyoobeen drunk!... We’ve hated each other for many things, Katya, but I swear,yooI swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you didn’t love me!”yooyooHe sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair. The prosecutoryooand counsel for the defense began cross-examining her, chiefly toyooascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document and to give heryooevidence in quite a different tone and spirit just before.yooyoo“Yes, yes. I was telling lies just now. I was lying against my honor andyoomy conscience, but I wanted to save him, for he has hated and despised meyooso!” Katya cried madly. “Oh, he has despised me horribly, he has alwaysyoodespised me, and do you know, he has despised me from the very moment thatyooI bowed down to him for that money. I saw that.... I felt it at once atyoothe time, but for a long time I wouldn’t believe it. How often I have readyooit in his eyes, ‘You came of yourself, though.’ Oh, he didn’t understand,yoohe had no idea why I ran to him, he can suspect nothing but baseness, heyoojudged me by himself, he thought every one was like himself!” Katya hissedyoofuriously, in a perfect frenzy. “And he only wanted to marry me, becauseyooI’d inherited a fortune, because of that, because of that! I alwaysyoosuspected it was because of that! Oh, he is a brute! He was alwaysyooconvinced that I should be trembling with shame all my life before him,yoobecause I went to him then, and that he had a right to despise me for everyoofor it, and so to be superior to me—that’s why he wanted to marry me!yooThat’s so, that’s all so! I tried to conquer him by my love—a love thatyooknew no bounds. I even tried to forgive his faithlessness; but heyoounderstood nothing, nothing! How could he understand indeed? He is ayoomonster! I only received that letter the next evening: it was brought meyoofrom the tavern—and only that morning, only that morning I wanted toyooforgive him everything, everything—even his treachery!”yooyooThe President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her. I can’tyoohelp thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her hysteriayooand of listening to such avowals. I remember hearing them say to her, “Weyoounderstand how hard it is for you; be sure we are able to feel for you,”yooand so on, and so on. And yet they dragged the evidence out of the raving,yoohysterical woman. She described at last with extraordinary clearness,yoowhich is so often seen, though only for a moment, in such over-wroughtyoostates, how Ivan had been nearly driven out of his mind during the lastyootwo months trying to save “the monster and murderer,” his brother.yooyoo“He tortured himself,” she exclaimed, “he was always trying to minimizeyoohis brother’s guilt and confessing to me that he, too, had never loved hisyoofather, and perhaps desired his death himself. Oh, he has a tender,yooover-tender conscience! He tormented himself with his conscience! He toldyoome everything, everything! He came every day and talked to me as his onlyyoofriend. I have the honor to be his only friend!” she cried suddenly with ayoosort of defiance, and her eyes flashed. “He had been twice to seeyooSmerdyakov. One day he came to me and said, ‘If it was not my brother, butyooSmerdyakov committed the murder’ (for the legend was circulatingyooeverywhere that Smerdyakov had done it), ‘perhaps I too am guilty, foryooSmerdyakov knew I didn’t like my father and perhaps believed that Iyoodesired my father’s death.’ Then I brought out that letter and showed ityoohim. He was entirely convinced that his brother had done it, and he wasyoooverwhelmed by it. He couldn’t endure the thought that his own brother wasyooa parricide! Only a week ago I saw that it was making him ill. During theyoolast few days he has talked incoherently in my presence. I saw his mindyoowas giving way. He walked about, raving; he was seen muttering in theyoostreets. The doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him the dayyoobefore yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain fever—and allyooon his account, on account of this monster! And last night he learnt thatyooSmerdyakov was dead! It was such a shock that it drove him out of his mindyoo... and all through this monster, all for the sake of saving the monster!”yooyooOh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible once inyooa lifetime—at the hour of death, for instance, on the way to the scaffold!yooBut it was in Katya’s character, and it was such a moment in her life. Ityoowas the same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of ayooyoung profligate to save her father; the same Katya who had just before,yooin her pride and chastity, sacrificed herself and her maidenly modestyyoobefore all these people, telling of Mitya’s generous conduct, in the hopeyooof softening his fate a little. And now, again, she sacrificed herself;yoobut this time it was for another, and perhaps only now—perhaps only atyoothis moment—she felt and knew how dear that other was to her! She hadyoosacrificed herself in terror for him, conceiving all of a sudden that heyoohad ruined himself by his confession that it was he who had committed theyoomurder, not his brother, she had sacrificed herself to save him, to saveyoohis good name, his reputation!yooyooAnd yet one terrible doubt occurred to one—was she lying in heryoodescription of her former relations with Mitya?—that was the question. No,yooshe had not intentionally slandered him when she cried that Mitya despisedyooher for her bowing down to him! She believed it herself. She had beenyoofirmly convinced, perhaps ever since that bow, that the simple-heartedyooMitya, who even then adored her, was laughing at her and despising her.yooShe had loved him with an hysterical, “lacerated” love only from pride,yoofrom wounded pride, and that love was not like love, but more likeyoorevenge. Oh! perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love,yooperhaps Katya longed for nothing more than that, but Mitya’s faithlessnessyoohad wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and her heart could notyooforgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon her suddenly, and allyoothat had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the offendedyoowoman’s breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly. She betrayed Mitya,yoobut she betrayed herself, too. And no sooner had she given full expressionyooto her feelings than the tension of course was over and she wasyoooverwhelmed with shame. Hysterics began again: she fell on the floor,yoosobbing and screaming. She was carried out. At that moment Grushenka, withyooa wail, rushed towards Mitya before they had time to prevent her.yooyoo“Mitya,” she wailed, “your serpent has destroyed you! There, she has shownyooyou what she is!” she shouted to the judges, shaking with anger. At ayoosignal from the President they seized her and tried to remove her from theyoocourt. She wouldn’t allow it. She fought and struggled to get back toyooMitya. Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her. He wasyoooverpowered.yooyooYes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have beenyoosatisfied—the show had been a varied one. Then I remember the Moscowyoodoctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President had previously sentyoothe court usher to arrange for medical aid for Ivan. The doctor announcedyooto the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack ofyoobrain fever, and that he must be at once removed. In answer to questionsyoofrom the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense he said that theyoopatient had come to him of his own accord the day before yesterday andyoothat he had warned him that he had such an attack coming on, but he hadyoonot consented to be looked after. “He was certainly not in a normal stateyooof mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake, that heyoomet several persons in the street, who were dead, and that Satan visitedyoohim every evening,” said the doctor, in conclusion. Having given hisyooevidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew. The letter produced by KaterinayooIvanovna was added to the material proofs. After some deliberation, theyoojudges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpectedyoopieces of evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol.yooyooBut I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who onlyyoorepeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with theiryoocharacteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in theyooprosecutor’s speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one wasyooexcited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all wereyooawaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intenseyooimpatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna’syooevidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence hadyoobeen taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it wasyoojust eight o’clock when the President returned to his seat and ouryooprosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech.yooyooyooyooChapter VI. The Prosecutor’s Speech. Sketches Of CharacteryooyooyooIppolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, withyoocold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns. Heyoodescribed this himself afterwards. He regarded this speech as hisyoo_chef-d’œuvre_, the _chef-d’œuvre_ of his whole life, as his swan-song. Heyoodied, it is true, nine months later of rapid consumption, so that he hadyoothe right, as it turned out, to compare himself to a swan singing his lastyoosong. He had put his whole heart and all the brain he had into thatyoospeech. And poor Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at leastyoosome feeling for the public welfare and “the eternal question” layyooconcealed in him. Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity.yooHe genuinely believed in the prisoner’s guilt; he was accusing him not asyooan official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he quivered with ayoogenuine passion “for the security of society.” Even the ladies in theyooaudience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch, admittedyoothat he made an extraordinary impression on them. He began in a breakingyoovoice, but it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of hisyoospeech. But as soon as he had finished, he almost fainted.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury,” began the prosecutor, “this case has made a stiryoothroughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at, what is there soyoopeculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed to such crimes!yooThat’s what’s so horrible, that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us.yooWhat ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it, and not thisyooor that isolated crime. What are the causes of our indifference, ouryoolukewarm attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of anyoounenviable future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion ofyoointellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, inyoospite of its youth? Is it that our moral principles are shattered to theiryoofoundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles amongyoous? I cannot answer such questions; nevertheless they are disturbing, andyooevery citizen not only must, but ought to be harassed by them. Our newbornyooand still timid press has done good service to the public already, foryoowithout it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violenceyooand moral degradation which are continually made known by the press, notyoomerely to those who attend the new jury courts established in the presentyooreign, but to every one. And what do we read almost daily? Of thingsyoobeside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost commonplace.yooBut what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes ofyooviolence bear witness to a widespread evil, now so general among us thatyooit is difficult to contend against it.yooyoo“One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the veryyoooutset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a pang ofyooconscience, murdering an official who had once been his benefactor, andyoothe servant girl, to steal his own I.O.U. and what ready money he couldyoofind on him; ‘it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionableyooworld and for my career in the future.’ After murdering them, he putsyoopillows under the head of each of his victims; he goes away. Next, a youngyoohero ‘decorated for bravery’ kills the mother of his chief and benefactor,yoolike a highwayman, and to urge his companions to join him he asserts thatyoo‘she loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions and takeyoono precautions.’ Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare not say in theseyoodays that he is unique. Another man will not commit the murder, but willyoofeel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in soul. In silence, aloneyoowith his conscience, he asks himself perhaps, ‘What is honor, and isn’tyoothe condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?’yooyoo“Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical, thatyooit is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let them say so—andyooheavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were so! Oh, don’t believeyoome, think of me as morbid, but remember my words; if only a tenth, if onlyyooa twentieth part of what I say is true—even so it’s awful! Look how ouryooyoung people commit suicide, without asking themselves Hamlet’s questionyoowhat there is beyond, without a sign of such a question, as though allyoothat relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had longyoobeen erased in their minds and buried under the sands. Look at our vice,yooat our profligates. Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless victim in the presentyoocase, was almost an innocent babe compared with many of them. And yet weyooall knew him, ‘he lived among us!’...yooyoo“Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of Europe willyoostudy the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject is worth it. Butyoothis study will come later, at leisure, when all the tragic topsy-turvydomyooof to-day is farther behind us, so that it’s possible to examine it withyoomore insight and more impartiality than I can do. Now we are eitheryoohorrified or pretend to be horrified, though we really gloat over theyoospectacle, and love strong and eccentric sensations which tickle ouryoocynical, pampered idleness. Or, like little children, we brush theyoodreadful ghosts away and hide our heads in the pillow so as to return toyooour sports and merriment as soon as they have vanished. But we must oneyooday begin life in sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a society;yooit’s time we tried to grasp something of our social position, or at leastyooto make a beginning in that direction.yooyoo“A great writer(9) of the last epoch, comparing Russia to a swift troikayoogalloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, ‘Oh, troika, birdlike troika, whoyooinvented thee!’ and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the peoples of theyooworld stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly gallopingyootroika to pass. That may be, they may stand aside, respectfully or no, butyooin my poor opinion the great writer ended his book in this way either inyooan access of childish and naïve optimism, or simply in fear of theyoocensorship of the day. For if the troika were drawn by his heroes,yooSobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov, it could reach no rational goal,yoowhoever might be driving it. And those were the heroes of an olderyoogeneration, ours are worse specimens still....”yooyooAt this point Ippolit Kirillovitch’s speech was interrupted by applause.yooThe liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. The applause was,yooit’s true, of brief duration, so that the President did not think ityoonecessary to caution the public, and only looked severely in the directionyooof the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged; he had neveryoobeen applauded before! He had been all his life unable to get a hearing,yooand now he suddenly had an opportunity of securing the ear of all Russia.yooyoo“What, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such anyoounenviable notoriety throughout Russia?” he continued. “Perhaps I amyooexaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental features of theyooeducated class of to-day are reflected in this family picture—only, ofyoocourse, in miniature, ‘like the sun in a drop of water.’ Think of thatyoounhappy, vicious, unbridled old man, who has met with such a melancholyyooend, the head of a family! Beginning life of noble birth, but in a pooryoodependent position, through an unexpected marriage he came into a smallyoofortune. A petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, thoughyooundeveloped, intelligence, he was, above all, a moneylender, who grewyoobolder with growing prosperity. His abject and servile characteristicsyoodisappeared, his malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that remained.yooOn the spiritual side he was undeveloped, while his vitality wasyooexcessive. He saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure, and he brought hisyoochildren up to be the same. He had no feelings for his duties as a father.yooHe ridiculed those duties. He left his little children to the servants,yooand was glad to be rid of them, forgot about them completely. The oldyooman’s maxim was _Après moi le déluge_. He was an example of everythingyoothat is opposed to civic duty, of the most complete and malignantyooindividualism. ‘The world may burn for aught I care, so long as I am allyooright,’ and he was all right; he was content, he was eager to go on livingyooin the same way for another twenty or thirty years. He swindled his ownyooson and spent his money, his maternal inheritance, on trying to get hisyoomistress from him. No, I don’t intend to leave the prisoner’s defenseyooaltogether to my talented colleague from Petersburg. I will speak theyootruth myself, I can well understand what resentment he had heaped up inyoohis son’s heart against him.yooyoo“But enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he has paid the penalty. Letyoous remember, however, that he was a father, and one of the typical fathersyooof to-day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that he is typical of manyyoomodern fathers? Alas! many of them only differ in not openly professingyoosuch cynicism, for they are better educated, more cultured, but theiryoophilosophy is essentially the same as his. Perhaps I am a pessimist, butyooyou have agreed to forgive me. Let us agree beforehand, you need notyoobelieve me, but let me speak. Let me say what I have to say, and rememberyoosomething of my words.yooyoo“Now for the children of this father, this head of a family. One of themyoois the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal with him.yooOf the other two I will speak only cursorily.yooyoo“The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education andyoovigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He has deniedyooand rejected much already, like his father. We have all heard him, he wasyooa welcome guest in local society. He never concealed his opinions, quiteyoothe contrary in fact, which justifies me in speaking rather openly of himyoonow, of course, not as an individual, but as a member of the Karamazovyoofamily. Another personage closely connected with the case died here by hisyooown hand last night. I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, andyoopossibly the illegitimate son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At theyoopreliminary inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young IvanyooKaramazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity. ‘Everything in theyooworld is lawful according to him, and nothing must be forbidden in theyoofuture—that is what he always taught me.’ I believe that idiot was drivenyooout of his mind by this theory, though, of course, the epileptic attacksyoofrom which he suffered, and this terrible catastrophe, have helped toyoounhinge his faculties. But he dropped one very interesting observation,yoowhich would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is,yooindeed, why I’ve mentioned it: ‘If there is one of the sons that is likeyooFyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.’yooyoo“With that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling ityooindelicate to continue further. Oh, I don’t want to draw any furtheryooconclusions and croak like a raven over the young man’s future. We’ve seenyooto-day in this court that there are still good impulses in his youngyooheart, that family feeling has not been destroyed in him by lack of faithyooand cynicism, which have come to him rather by inheritance than by theyooexercise of independent thought.yooyoo“Then the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth, who does notyooshare his elder brother’s gloomy and destructive theory of life. He hasyoosought to cling to the ‘ideas of the people,’ or to what goes by that nameyooin some circles of our intellectual classes. He clung to the monastery,yooand was within an ace of becoming a monk. He seems to me to have betrayedyoounconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which leads so many in ouryoounhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences, andyoomistakenly attribute all the mischief to European enlightenment, to returnyooto their ‘native soil,’ as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of theiryoomother earth, like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on theyoowithered bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, onlyyooto escape the horrors that terrify them.yooyoo“For my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every success; Iyootrust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of theyoopeople may never degenerate, as often happens, on the moral side intoyoogloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind chauvinism—two elementsyoowhich are even a greater menace to Russia than the premature decay, due toyoomisunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which hisyooelder brother is suffering.”yooyooTwo or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism andyoomysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by his ownyooeloquence. All this had little to do with the case in hand, to say nothingyooof the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and consumptiveyooman was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his life. Peopleyoosaid afterwards that he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticismyooof Ivan, because the latter had on one or two occasions got the better ofyoohim in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now toyootake his revenge. But I don’t know whether it was true. All this was onlyyoointroductory, however, and the speech passed to more direct considerationyooof the case.yooyoo“But to return to the eldest son,” Ippolit Kirillovitch went on. “He isyoothe prisoner before us. We have his life and his actions, too, before us;yoothe fatal day has come and all has been brought to the surface. While hisyoobrothers seem to stand for ‘Europeanism’ and ‘the principles of theyoopeople,’ he seems to represent Russia as she is. Oh, not all Russia, notyooall! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here we have her, our motheryooRussia, the very scent and sound of her. Oh, he is spontaneous, he is ayoomarvelous mingling of good and evil, he is a lover of culture andyooSchiller, yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of his boonyoocompanions. Oh, he, too, can be good and noble, but only when all goesyoowell with him. What is more, he can be carried off his feet, positivelyyoocarried off his feet by noble ideals, but only if they come of themselves,yooif they fall from heaven for him, if they need not be paid for. Heyoodislikes paying for anything, but is very fond of receiving, and that’s soyoowith him in everything. Oh, give him every possible good in life (heyoocouldn’t be content with less), and put no obstacle in his way, and heyoowill show that he, too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no, but he mustyoohave money, a great deal of money, and you will see how generously, withyoowhat scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all away in the recklessyoodissipation of one night. But if he has not money, he will show what he isyooready to do to get it when he is in great need of it. But all this later,yoolet us take events in their chronological order.yooyoo“First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about theyooback-yard ‘without boots on his feet,’ as our worthy and esteemed fellowyoocitizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now. I repeat ityooagain, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am here to accuseyoohim, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human; I, too, can weigh theyooinfluence of home and childhood on the character. But the boy grows up andyoobecomes an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled toyooone of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as anyooofficer. And, of course, he needed money, money before all things, and soyooafter prolonged disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and theyoolast six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which heyoopractically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict withyoohis father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand.yooyoo“Then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and brilliantyooeducation. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you have only justyooheard them. Honor, self-sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent.yooThe figure of the young officer, frivolous and profligate, doing homage toyootrue nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown in a very sympathetic lightyoobefore us. But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to usyooimmediately after in this very court. Again I will not venture toyooconjecture why it happened so, but there were causes. The same lady,yoobathed in tears of long-concealed indignation, alleged that he, he of allyoomen, had despised her for her action, which, though incautious, recklessyooperhaps, was still dictated by lofty and generous motives. He, he, theyoogirl’s betrothed, looked at her with that smile of mockery, which was moreyooinsufferable from him than from any one. And knowing that he had alreadyyoodeceived her (he had deceived her, believing that she was bound to endureyooeverything from him, even treachery), she intentionally offered him threeyoothousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly, let him understand that sheyoowas offering him money to deceive her. ‘Well, will you take it or not, areyooyou so lost to shame?’ was the dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes. Heyoolooked at her, saw clearly what was in her mind (he’s admitted here beforeyooyou that he understood it all), appropriated that three thousandyoounconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new object of hisyooaffections.yooyoo“What are we to believe then? The first legend of the young officeryoosacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity and doingyooreverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture? As a rule, betweenyootwo extremes one has to find the mean, but in the present case this is notyootrue. The probability is that in the first case he was genuinely noble,yooand in the second as genuinely base. And why? Because he was of the broadyooKaramazov character—that’s just what I am leading up to—capable ofyoocombining the most incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatestyooheights and of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant remark made byyooa young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close quarters—Mr.yooRakitin: ‘The sense of their own degradation is as essential to thoseyooreckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their lofty generosity.’ Andyoothat’s true, they need continually this unnatural mixture. Two extremes atyoothe same moment, or they are miserable and dissatisfied and theiryooexistence is incomplete. They are wide, wide as mother Russia; theyyooinclude everything and put up with everything.yooyoo“By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we’ve just touched upon that threeyoothousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things a little. Canyooyou conceive that a man like that, on receiving that sum and in such ayooway, at the price of such shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation,yoocould have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum, thatyoovery day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had theyoofirmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole monthyooafterwards, in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of it!yooNeither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he was flying into theyoocountry, trying to get from God knows whom, the money so essential to himyooto remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his father,yoodid he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only to avoidyooabandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so jealous, he wouldyoohave been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayed at home toyookeep watch over her, and to await the moment when she would say to him atyoolast ‘I am yours,’ and to fly with her far from their fatal surroundings.yooyoo“But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason he givesyoofor it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when she wouldyoosay, ‘I am yours, take me where you will,’ he might have the wherewithalyooto take her. But that first reason, in the prisoner’s own words, was ofyoolittle weight beside the second. While I have that money on me, he said, Iyooam a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can always go to my insulted betrothed,yooand, laying down half the sum I have fraudulently appropriated, I canyooalways say to her, ‘You see, I’ve squandered half your money, and shown Iyooam a weak and immoral man, and, if you like, a scoundrel’ (I use theyooprisoner’s own expressions), ‘but though I am a scoundrel, I am not ayoothief, for if I had been a thief, I shouldn’t have brought you back thisyoohalf of the money, but should have taken it as I did the other half!’ Ayoomarvelous explanation! This frantic, but weak man, who could not resistyoothe temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at the price ofyoosuch disgrace, this very man suddenly develops the most stoical firmness,yooand carries about a thousand roubles without daring to touch it. Does thatyoofit in at all with the character we have analyzed? No, and I venture toyootell you how the real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in suchyoocircumstances, if he really had brought himself to put away the money.yooyoo“At the first temptation—for instance, to entertain the woman with whom heyoohad already squandered half the money—he would have unpicked his littleyoobag and have taken out some hundred roubles, for why should he have takenyooback precisely half the money, that is, fifteen hundred roubles? why notyoofourteen hundred? He could just as well have said then that he was not ayoothief, because he brought back fourteen hundred roubles. Then another timeyoohe would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred, and then ayoothird, and then a fourth, and before the end of the month he would haveyootaken the last note but one, feeling that if he took back only a hundredyooit would answer the purpose, for a thief would have stolen it all. Andyoothen he would have looked at this last note, and have said to himself,yoo‘It’s really not worth while to give back one hundred; let’s spend that,yootoo!’ That’s how the real Dmitri Karamazov, as we know him, would haveyoobehaved. One cannot imagine anything more incongruous with the actual factyoothan this legend of the little bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable.yooBut we shall return to that later.”yooyooAfter touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning theyoofinancial relations of father and son, and arguing again and again that ityoowas utterly impossible, from the facts known, to determine which was inyoothe wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the medicalyooexperts in reference to Mitya’s fixed idea about the three thousand owingyoohim.yooyooyooyooChapter VII. An Historical Surveyyooyooyoo“The medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner is outyooof his mind and, in fact, a maniac. I maintain that he is in his rightyoomind, and that if he had not been, he would have behaved more cleverly. Asyoofor his being a maniac, that I would agree with, but only in one point,yoothat is, his fixed idea about the three thousand. Yet I think one mightyoofind a much simpler cause than his tendency to insanity. For my part Iyooagree thoroughly with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner’syoomental faculties have always been normal, and that he has only beenyooirritable and exasperated. The object of the prisoner’s continual andyooviolent anger was not the sum itself; there was a special motive at theyoobottom of it. That motive is jealousy!”yooyooHere Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner’s fatal passionyoofor Grushenka. He began from the moment when the prisoner went to theyoo“young person’s” lodgings “to beat her”—“I use his own expression,” theyooprosecutor explained—“but instead of beating her, he remained there, atyooher feet. That was the beginning of the passion. At the same time theyooprisoner’s father was captivated by the same young person—a strange andyoofatal coincidence, for they both lost their hearts to her simultaneously,yoothough both had known her before. And she inspired in both of them theyoomost violent, characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her ownyooconfession: ‘I was laughing at both of them.’ Yes, the sudden desire toyoomake a jest of them came over her, and she conquered both of them at once.yooThe old man, who worshiped money, at once set aside three thousand roublesyooas a reward for one visit from her, but soon after that, he would haveyoobeen happy to lay his property and his name at her feet, if only she wouldyoobecome his lawful wife. We have good evidence of this. As for theyooprisoner, the tragedy of his fate is evident; it is before us. But suchyoowas the young person’s ‘game.’ The enchantress gave the unhappy young manyoono hope until the last moment, when he knelt before her, stretching outyoohands that were already stained with the blood of his father and rival. Ityoowas in that position that he was arrested. ‘Send me to Siberia with him, Iyoohave brought him to this, I am most to blame,’ the woman herself cried, inyoogenuine remorse at the moment of his arrest.yooyoo“The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr. Rakitin,yoocharacterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms: ‘She wasyoodisillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed, whoyooseduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty, cursed by heryoorespectable family, and taken under the protection of a wealthy old man,yoowhom she still, however, considers as her benefactor. There was perhapsyoomuch that was good in her young heart, but it was embittered too early.yooShe became prudent and saved money. She grew sarcastic and resentfulyooagainst society.’ After this sketch of her character it may well beyoounderstood that she might laugh at both of them simply from mischief, fromyoomalice.yooyoo“After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during which heyoobetrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to his honor, theyooprisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to madness by continualyoojealousy—and of whom? His father! And the worst of it was that the crazyyooold man was alluring and enticing the object of his affection by means ofyoothat very three thousand roubles, which the son looked upon as his ownyooproperty, part of his inheritance from his mother, of which his father wasyoocheating him. Yes, I admit it was hard to bear! It might well drive a manyooto madness. It was not the money, but the fact that this money was usedyoowith such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness!”yooyooThen the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering hisyoofather had entered the prisoner’s head, and illustrated his theory withyoofacts.yooyoo“At first he only talked about it in taverns—he was talking about it allyoothat month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with company, and heyoolikes to tell his companions everything, even his most diabolical andyoodangerous ideas; he likes to share every thought with others, and expects,yoofor some reason, that those he confides in will meet him with perfectyoosympathy, enter into all his troubles and anxieties, take his part and notyoooppose him in anything. If not, he flies into a rage and smashes upyooeverything in the tavern. [Then followed the anecdote about CaptainyooSnegiryov.] Those who heard the prisoner began to think at last that heyoomight mean more than threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threatsyoointo actions.”yooyooHere the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the monastery,yoothe conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene of violence whenyoothe prisoner had rushed into his father’s house just after dinner.yooyoo“I cannot positively assert,” the prosecutor continued, “that the prisoneryoofully intended to murder his father before that incident. Yet the idea hadyooseveral times presented itself to him, and he had deliberated on it—foryoothat we have facts, witnesses, and his own words. I confess, gentlemen ofyoothe jury,” he added, “that till to-day I have been uncertain whether toyooattribute to the prisoner conscious premeditation. I was firmly convincedyoothat he had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only picturedyooit, contemplating it as a possibility. He had not definitely consideredyoowhen and how he might commit the crime.yooyoo“But I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document wasyoopresented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that young lady’syooexclamation, ‘It is the plan, the program of the murder!’ That is how sheyoodefined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner. And, inyoofact, from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder wasyoopremeditated. It was written two days before, and so we know now for ayoofact that, forty-eight hours before the perpetration of his terribleyoodesign, the prisoner swore that, if he could not get money next day, heyoowould murder his father in order to take the envelope with the notes fromyoounder his pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. ‘As soon as Ivan had goneyooaway’—you hear that; so he had thought everything out, weighing everyyoocircumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had written it. Theyooproof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been committedyoofor the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that is written andyoosigned. The prisoner does not deny his signature.yooyoo“I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does not diminishyoothe value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote when drunk what heyoohad planned when sober. Had he not planned it when sober, he would notyoohave written it when drunk. I shall be asked: Then why did he talk aboutyooit in taverns? A man who premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps ityooto himself. Yes, but he talked about it before he had formed a plan, whenyoohe had only the desire, only the impulse to it. Afterwards he talked lessyooabout it. On the evening he wrote that letter at the ‘Metropolis’ tavern,yoocontrary to his custom he was silent, though he had been drinking. He didyoonot play billiards, he sat in a corner, talked to no one. He did indeedyooturn a shopman out of his seat, but that was done almost unconsciously,yoobecause he could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance. It isyootrue that after he had taken the final decision, he must have feltyooapprehensive that he had talked too much about his design beforehand, andyoothat this might lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards. But thereyoowas nothing for it; he could not take his words back, but his luck hadyooserved him before, it would serve him again. He believed in his star, youyooknow! I must confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatalyoocatastrophe. ‘To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,’yooas he writes in his peculiar language, ‘and if they won’t give it to me,yoothere will be bloodshed.’ ”yooyooHere Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all Mitya’syooefforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to Samsonov, hisyoojourney to Lyagavy. “Harassed, jeered at, hungry, after selling his watchyooto pay for the journey (though he tells us he had fifteen hundred roublesyooon him—a likely story), tortured by jealousy at having left the object ofyoohis affections in the town, suspecting that she would go to FyodoryooPavlovitch in his absence, he returned at last to the town, to find, toyoohis joy, that she had not been near his father. He accompanied her himselfyooto her protector. (Strange to say, he doesn’t seem to have been jealous ofyooSamsonov, which is psychologically interesting.) Then he hastens back toyoohis ambush in the back gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in ayoofit, that the other servant is ill—the coast is clear and he knows theyoo‘signals’—what a temptation! Still he resists it; he goes off to a ladyyoowho has for some time been residing in the town, and who is highlyyooesteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who had long watched hisyoocareer with compassion, gave him the most judicious advice, to give up hisyoodissipated life, his unseemly love-affair, the waste of his youth andyoovigor in pot-house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to theyoogold-mines: ‘that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies, youryooromantic character, your thirst for adventure.’ ”yooyooAfter describing the result of this conversation and the moment when theyooprisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov’s, the suddenyoofrenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion,yooat the thought that she had deceived him and was now with his father,yooIppolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence ofyoochance. “Had the maid told him that her mistress was at Mokroe with heryooformer lover, nothing would have happened. But she lost her head, sheyoocould only swear and protest her ignorance, and if the prisoner did notyookill her on the spot, it was only because he flew in pursuit of his falseyoomistress.yooyoo“But note, frantic as he was, he took with him a brass pestle. Why that?yooWhy not some other weapon? But since he had been contemplating his planyooand preparing himself for it for a whole month, he would snatch upyooanything like a weapon that caught his eye. He had realized for a monthyoopast that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon, so he instantly,yoowithout hesitation, recognized that it would serve his purpose. So it wasyooby no means unconsciously, by no means involuntarily, that he snatched upyoothat fatal pestle. And then we find him in his father’s garden—the coastyoois clear, there are no witnesses, darkness and jealousy. The suspicionyoothat she was there, with him, with his rival, in his arms, and perhapsyoolaughing at him at that moment—took his breath away. And it was not mereyoosuspicion, the deception was open, obvious. She must be there, in thatyoolighted room, she must be behind the screen; and the unhappy man wouldyoohave us believe that he stole up to the window, peeped respectfully in,yooand discreetly withdrew, for fear something terrible and immoral shouldyoohappen. And he tries to persuade us of that, us, who understand hisyoocharacter, who know his state of mind at the moment, and that he knew theyoosignals by which he could at once enter the house.” At this point IppolityooKirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection ofyooSmerdyakov with the murder. He did this very circumstantially, and everyyooone realized that, although he professed to despise that suspicion, heyoothought the subject of great importance.yooyooyooyooChapter VIII. A Treatise On Smerdyakovyooyooyoo“To begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?” (IppolityooKirillovitch began.) “The first person who cried out that Smerdyakov hadyoocommitted the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his arrest,yooyet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single fact toyooconfirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact. The charge isyooconfirmed by three persons only—the two brothers of the prisoner andyooMadame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions onlyyooto-day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we knowyoothat for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction ofyoohis brother’s guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of thatyoolater. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the slightest factyooto support his notion of Smerdyakov’s guilt, and has only been led to thatyooconclusion from the prisoner’s own words and the expression of his face.yooYes, that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twiceyooto-day by him. Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. ‘What theyooprisoner tells you, you must believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.’ Thatyoois all the evidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons,yoowho are all deeply concerned in the prisoner’s fate. And yet the theory ofyooSmerdyakov’s guilt has been noised about, has been and is stillyoomaintained. Is it credible? Is it conceivable?”yooyooHere Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the personalityyooof Smerdyakov, “who had cut short his life in a fit of insanity.” Heyoodepicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a smattering of education,yoowho had been thrown off his balance by philosophical ideas above his levelyooand certain modern theories of duty, which he learnt in practice from theyooreckless life of his master, who was also perhaps his father—FyodoryooPavlovitch; and, theoretically, from various strange philosophicalyooconversations with his master’s elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readilyyooindulged in this diversion, probably feeling dull or wishing to amuseyoohimself at the valet’s expense. “He spoke to me himself of his spiritualyoocondition during the last few days at his father’s house,” IppolityooKirillovitch explained; “but others too have borne witness to it—theyooprisoner himself, his brother, and the servant Grigory—that is, all whoyooknew him well.yooyoo“Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks of epilepsy,yoohad not the courage of a chicken. ‘He fell at my feet and kissed them,’yoothe prisoner himself has told us, before he realized how damaging such ayoostatement was to himself. ‘He is an epileptic chicken,’ he declared aboutyoohim in his characteristic language. And the prisoner chose him for hisyooconfidant (we have his own word for it) and he frightened him intoyooconsenting at last to act as a spy for him. In that capacity he deceivedyoohis master, revealing to the prisoner the existence of the envelope withyoothe notes in it and the signals by means of which he could get into theyoohouse. How could he help telling him, indeed? ‘He would have killed me, Iyoocould see that he would have killed me,’ he said at the inquiry, tremblingyooand shaking even before us, though his tormentor was by that time arrestedyooand could do him no harm. ‘He suspected me at every instant. In fear andyootrembling I hastened to tell him every secret to pacify him, that he mightyoosee that I had not deceived him and let me off alive.’ Those are his ownyoowords. I wrote them down and I remember them. ‘When he began shouting atyoome, I would fall on my knees.’yooyoo“He was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence of hisyoomaster, ever since he had restored him some money he had lost. So it mayyoobe supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs of remorse at havingyoodeceived his master, whom he loved as his benefactor. Persons severelyyooafflicted with epilepsy are, so the most skillful doctors tell us, alwaysyooprone to continual and morbid self-reproach. They worry over theiryoo‘wickedness,’ they are tormented by pangs of conscience, often entirelyyoowithout cause; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults andyoocrimes. And here we have a man of that type who had really been driven toyoowrong-doing by terror and intimidation.yooyoo“He had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible would beyoothe outcome of the situation that was developing before his eyes. WhenyooIvan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just before the catastrophe,yooSmerdyakov besought him to remain, though he was too timid to tell himyooplainly what he feared. He confined himself to hints, but his hints wereyoonot understood.yooyoo“It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a protector,yoowhose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come toyoopass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov’s drunken letter, ‘I shallyookill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.’ So Ivan Fyodorovitch’s presenceyooseemed to every one a guarantee of peace and order in the house.yooyoo“But he went away, and within an hour of his young master’s departureyooSmerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But that’s perfectlyyoointelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed by terror andyoodespair of a sort, had felt during those last few days that one of theyoofits from which he had suffered before at moments of strain, might beyoocoming upon him again. The day and hour of such an attack cannot, ofyoocourse, be foreseen, but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he isyoolikely to have one. So the doctors tell us. And so, as soon as IvanyooFyodorovitch had driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by hisyoolonely and unprotected position, went to the cellar. He went down theyoostairs wondering if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were toyoocome upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very wonder,yoobrought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks, andyoohe fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this perfectly naturalyoooccurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he was shammingyooan attack _on purpose_. But, if it were on purpose, the question arises atyooonce, what was his motive? What was he reckoning on? What was he aimingyooat? I say nothing about medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: theyoodoctors were not able to discriminate between the counterfeit and theyooreal. That may be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he foryoosuch a counterfeit? Could he, had he been plotting the murder, haveyoodesired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit justyoobefore?yooyoo“You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder, there wereyoofive persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch’s—Fyodor Pavlovitch himself (but he didyoonot kill himself, that’s evident); then his servant, Grigory, but he wasyooalmost killed himself; the third person was Grigory’s wife, MarfayooIgnatyevna, but it would be simply shameful to imagine her murdering heryoomaster. Two persons are left—the prisoner and Smerdyakov. But, if we areyooto believe the prisoner’s statement that he is not the murderer, thenyooSmerdyakov must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one elseyoocan be found. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding accusationyooagainst the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday. Had a shadow ofyoosuspicion rested on any one else, had there been any sixth person, I amyoopersuaded that even the prisoner would have been ashamed to accuseyooSmerdyakov, and would have accused that sixth person, for to chargeyooSmerdyakov with that murder is perfectly absurd.yooyoo“Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine, let usyooeven lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what the factsyootell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how did he do it? Alone or with theyooassistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the first alternative—that heyoodid it alone. If he had killed him it must have been with some object, foryoosome advantage to himself. But not having a shadow of the motive that theyooprisoner had for the murder—hatred, jealousy, and so on—Smerdyakov couldyooonly have murdered him for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate theyoothree thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope. And yetyoohe tells another person—and a person most closely interested, that is, theyooprisoner—everything about the money and the signals, where the envelopeyoolay, what was written on it, what it was tied up with, and, above all,yootold him of those signals by which he could enter the house. Did he doyoothis simply to betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one whoyoowould be anxious to get that envelope for himself? ‘Yes,’ I shall be told,yoo‘but he betrayed it from fear.’ But how do you explain this? A man whoyoocould conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tellsyoofacts which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he heldyoohis tongue, no one would ever have guessed!yooyoo“No, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a crime, nothingyoowould have induced him to tell any one about the envelope and the signals,yoofor that was as good as betraying himself beforehand. He would haveyooinvented something, he would have told some lie if he had been forced toyoogive information, but he would have been silent about that. For, on theyooother hand, if he had said nothing about the money, but had committed theyoomurder and stolen the money, no one in the world could have charged himyoowith murder for the sake of robbery, since no one but he had seen theyoomoney, no one but he knew of its existence in the house. Even if he hadyoobeen accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he hadyoocommitted it from some other motive. But since no one had observed anyyoosuch motive in him beforehand, and every one saw, on the contrary, thatyoohis master was fond of him and honored him with his confidence, he would,yooof course, have been the last to be suspected. People would have suspectedyoofirst the man who had a motive, a man who had himself declared he had suchyoomotives, who had made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspectedyoothe son of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov killedyooand robbed him, and the son been accused of it, that would, of course,yoohave suited Smerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that, though plotting theyoomurder, he told that son, Dmitri, about the money, the envelope, and theyoosignals? Is that logical? Is that clear?yooyoo“When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we have himyoofalling downstairs in a _feigned_ fit—with what object? In the first placeyoothat Grigory, who had been intending to take his medicine, might put ityoooff and remain on guard, seeing there was no one to look after the house,yooand, in the second place, I suppose, that his master seeing that there wasyoono one to guard him, and in terror of a visit from his son, might redoubleyoohis vigilance and precaution. And, most of all, I suppose that he,yooSmerdyakov, disabled by the fit, might be carried from the kitchen, whereyoohe always slept, apart from all the rest, and where he could go in and outyooas he liked, to Grigory’s room at the other end of the lodge, where he wasyooalways put, shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed. This wasyoothe immemorial custom established by his master and the kind-hearted MarfayooIgnatyevna, whenever he had a fit. There, lying behind the screen, heyoowould most likely, to keep up the sham, have begun groaning, and soyookeeping them awake all night (as Grigory and his wife testified). And allyoothis, we are to believe, that he might more conveniently get up and murderyoohis master!yooyoo“But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he might notyoobe suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money and the signals toyootempt him to commit the murder, and when he had murdered him and had goneyooaway with the money, making a noise, most likely, and waking people,yooSmerdyakov got up, am I to believe, and went in—what for? To murder hisyoomaster a second time and carry off the money that had already been stolen?yooGentlemen, are you laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions,yoobut, incredible as it seems, that’s just what the prisoner alleges. Whenyoohe had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised an alarm, heyootells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his master and stole theyoomoney! I won’t press the point that Smerdyakov could hardly have reckonedyooon this beforehand, and have foreseen that the furious and exasperated sonyoowould simply come to peep in respectfully, though he knew the signals, andyoobeat a retreat, leaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I putyoothis question to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov couldyoohave committed his crime? Name that moment, or you can’t accuse him.yooyoo“But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered,yooheard a shout, and went out. Well—what then? He looked about him and said,yoo‘Why not go and kill the master?’ And how did he know what had happened,yoosince he had been lying unconscious till that moment? But there’s a limityooto these flights of fancy.yooyoo“ ‘Quite so,’ some astute people will tell me, ‘but what if they were inyooagreement? What if they murdered him together and shared the money—whatyoothen?’ A weighty question, truly! And the facts to confirm it areyooastounding. One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while hisyooaccomplice lies on one side shamming a fit, apparently to arouse suspicionyooin every one, alarm in his master and alarm in Grigory. It would beyoointeresting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices toyooform such an insane plan.yooyoo“But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov’s part,yoobut only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated andyooagreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing that he would be blamedyoofor letting his master be murdered, without screaming for help oryooresisting, he may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to getyooout of the way by shamming a fit—‘you may murder him as you like; it’syoonothing to me.’ But as this attack of Smerdyakov’s was bound to throw theyoohousehold into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to suchyooa plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he did agree, ityoowould still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer and theyooinstigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and not even anyooaccomplice, but merely acquiesced against his will through terror.yooyoo“But what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantlyyoothrows all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of being hisyooaccomplice, but of being himself the murderer. ‘He did it alone,’ he says.yoo‘He murdered and robbed him. It was the work of his hands.’ Strange sortyooof accomplices who begin to accuse one another at once! And think of theyoorisk for Karamazov. After committing the murder while his accomplice layyooin bed, he throws the blame on the invalid, who might well have resentedyooit and in self-preservation might well have confessed the truth. For heyoomight well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he wasyooresponsible, and so he might well have reckoned that if he were punished,yooit would be far less severely than the real murderer. But in that case heyoowould have been certain to make a confession, yet he has not done so.yooSmerdyakov never hinted at their complicity, though the actual murdereryoopersisted in accusing him and declaring that he had committed the crimeyooalone.yooyoo“What’s more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement that ityoowas _he_ who had told the prisoner of the envelope of notes and of theyoosignals, and that, but for him, he would have known nothing about them. Ifyoohe had really been a guilty accomplice, would he so readily have made thisyoostatement at the inquiry? On the contrary, he would have tried to concealyooit, to distort the facts or minimize them. But he was far from distortingyooor minimizing them. No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of beingyoocharged with complicity, could have acted as he did. And in a fit ofyoomelancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he hanged himselfyooyesterday. He left a note written in his peculiar language, ‘I destroyyoomyself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no blame on any one.’yooWhat would it have cost him to add: ‘I am the murderer, not Karamazov’?yooBut that he did not add. Did his conscience lead him to suicide and not toyooavowing his guilt?yooyoo“And what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were brought into theyoocourt just now, and we were told that they were the same that lay in theyooenvelope now on the table before us, and that the witness had receivedyoothem from Smerdyakov the day before. But I need not recall the painfulyooscene, though I will make one or two comments, selecting such trivial onesyooas might not be obvious at first sight to every one, and so may beyoooverlooked. In the first place, Smerdyakov must have given back the moneyyooand hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he confessedyoohis guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us. If it were not so,yooindeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept silence till now? And so,yooif he has confessed, then why, I ask again, did he not avow the wholeyootruth in the last letter he left behind, knowing that the innocentyooprisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next day?yooyoo“The money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the fact cameyooto the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court that IvanyooFyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons of five thousandyooeach—that is, ten thousand in all—to the chief town of the province to beyoochanged. I only mention this to point out that any one may have money, andyoothat it can’t be proved that these notes are the same as were in FyodoryooPavlovitch’s envelope.yooyoo“Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of suchyooimportance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why didn’t he report ityooat once? Why did he put it all off till morning? I think I have a right toyooconjecture why. His health had been giving way for a week past: he hadyooadmitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that he wasyoosuffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead: he was onyoothe eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been stricken downyooto-day. In this condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov’s death, and atyooonce reflected, ‘The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save myyoobrother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that Smerdyakovyoogave them me before his death.’ You will say that was dishonorable: it’syoodishonorable to slander even the dead, and even to save a brother. True,yoobut what if he slandered him unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged byyoothe sudden news of the valet’s death, he imagined it really was so? Youyoosaw the recent scene: you have seen the witness’s condition. He wasyoostanding up and was speaking, but where was his mind?yooyoo“Then followed the document, the prisoner’s letter written two days beforeyoothe crime, and containing a complete program of the murder. Why, then, areyoowe looking for any other program? The crime was committed preciselyyooaccording to this program, and by no other than the writer of it. Yes,yoogentlemen of the jury, it went off without a hitch! He did not runyoorespectfully and timidly away from his father’s window, though he wasyoofirmly convinced that the object of his affections was with him. No, thatyoois absurd and unlikely! He went in and murdered him. Most likely he killedyoohim in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he looked on his hatedyoorival. But having killed him, probably with one blow of the brass pestle,yooand having convinced himself, after careful search, that she was notyoothere, he did not, however, forget to put his hand under the pillow andyootake out the envelope, the torn cover of which lies now on the tableyoobefore us.yooyoo“I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, veryyoocharacteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer and hadyoohe committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would he have left theyootorn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside the corpse? Had it beenyooSmerdyakov, for instance, murdering his master to rob him, he would haveyoosimply carried away the envelope with him, without troubling himself toyooopen it over his victim’s corpse, for he would have known for certain thatyoothe notes were in the envelope—they had been put in and sealed up in hisyoopresence—and had he taken the envelope with him, no one would ever haveyooknown of the robbery. I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov have behavedyooin that way? Would he have left the envelope on the floor?yooyoo“No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who was not ayoothief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched the notes fromyoounder the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but as though seizingyoohis own property from the thief who had stolen it. For that was the ideayoowhich had become almost an insane obsession in Dmitri Karamazov in regardyooto that money. And pouncing upon the envelope, which he had never seenyoobefore, he tore it open to make sure whether the money was in it, and ranyooaway with the money in his pocket, even forgetting to consider that he hadyooleft an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelopeyooon the floor. All because it was Karamazov, not Smerdyakov, he didn’tyoothink, he didn’t reflect, and how should he? He ran away; he heard behindyoohim the servant cry out; the old man caught him, stopped him and wasyoofelled to the ground by the brass pestle.yooyoo“The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would you believeyooit, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of compassion, to seeyoowhether he could do anything for him. Was that a moment to showyoocompassion? No; he jumped down simply to make certain whether the onlyyoowitness of his crime were dead or alive. Any other feeling, any otheryoomotive would be unnatural. Note that he took trouble over Grigory, wipedyoohis head with his handkerchief and, convincing himself he was dead, he ranyooto the house of his mistress, dazed and covered with blood. How was it heyoonever thought that he was covered with blood and would be at onceyoodetected? But the prisoner himself assures us that he did not even noticeyoothat he was covered with blood. That may be believed, that is veryyoopossible, that always happens at such moments with criminals. On one pointyoothey will show diabolical cunning, while another will escape themyooaltogether. But he was thinking at that moment of one thing only—where wasyoo_she_? He wanted to find out at once where she was, so he ran to heryoolodging and learnt an unexpected and astounding piece of news—she had goneyoooff to Mokroe to meet her first lover.”yooyooyooyooChapter IX. The Galloping Troika. The End Of The Prosecutor’s Speech.yooyooyooIppolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of exposition,yoobeloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation a check onyootheir own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his speech he went off into ayoodissertation on Grushenka’s “first lover,” and brought forward severalyoointeresting thoughts on this theme.yooyoo“Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed, soyooto speak, and effaced himself at once before this first lover. What makesyooit all the more strange is that he seems to have hardly thought of thisyooformidable rival. But he had looked upon him as a remote danger, andyooKaramazov always lives in the present. Possibly he regarded him as ayoofiction. But his wounded heart grasped instantly that the woman had beenyooconcealing this new rival and deceiving him, because he was anything but ayoofiction to her, because he was the one hope of her life. Grasping thisyooinstantly, he resigned himself.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected trait inyoothe prisoner’s character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible desire foryoojustice, a respect for woman and a recognition of her right to love. Andyooall this at the very moment when he had stained his hands with hisyoofather’s blood for her sake! It is true that the blood he had shed wasyooalready crying out for vengeance, for, after having ruined his soul andyoohis life in this world, he was forced to ask himself at that same instantyoowhat he was and what he could be now to her, to that being, dearer to himyoothan his own soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returnedyoopenitent, with new love, to the woman he had once betrayed, with honorableyoooffers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life. And he, lucklessyooman, what could he give her now, what could he offer her?yooyoo“Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him by hisyoocrime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a man with lifeyoobefore him! This thought crushed him. And so he instantly flew to oneyoofrantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov’s character, must have appearedyoothe one inevitable way out of his terrible position. That way out wasyoosuicide. He ran for the pistols he had left in pledge with his friendyooPerhotin and on the way, as he ran, he pulled out of his pocket the money,yoofor the sake of which he had stained his hands with his father’s gore. Oh,yoonow he needed money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov wouldyooshoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he was a poet andyoohad burnt the candle at both ends all his life. ‘To her, to her! andyoothere, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such as never wasyoobefore, that will be remembered and talked of long after! In the midst ofyooshouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy songs and dances I shall raiseyoothe glass and drink to the woman I adore and her new-found happiness! Andyoothen, on the spot, at her feet, I shall dash out my brains before her andyoopunish myself! She will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will seeyoohow Mitya loved her, she will feel for Mitya!’yooyoo“Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair andyoosentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes, butyoothere is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries outyooin the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart untoyoodeath—that _something_ is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its judgment,yooits terrible torments! The pistol will settle everything, the pistol isyoothe only way out! But _beyond_—I don’t know whether Karamazov wondered atyoothat moment ‘What lies beyond,’ and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet,yoowonder ‘What lies beyond.’ No, gentlemen of the jury, they have theiryooHamlets, but we still have our Karamazovs!”yooyooHere Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya’s preparations,yoothe scene at Perhotin’s, at the shop, with the drivers. He quoted numerousyoowords and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and the picture made a terribleyooimpression on the audience. The guilt of this harassed and desperate manyoostood out clear and convincing, when the facts were brought together.yooyoo“What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost confessed,yoohinted at it, all but spoke out.” (Then followed the evidence given byyoowitnesses.) “He even cried out to the peasant who drove him, ‘Do you know,yooyou are driving a murderer!’ But it was impossible for him to speak out,yoohe had to get to Mokroe and there to finish his romance. But what wasyooawaiting the luckless man? Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he sawyoothat his invincible rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that theyootoast to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not beyooacceptable. But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from theyoopreliminary inquiry. Karamazov’s triumph over his rival was complete andyoohis soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most terrible phaseyoothrough which his soul has passed or will pass.yooyoo“One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,” the prosecutoryoocontinued, “that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring their ownyoovengeance more completely than any earthly justice. What’s more, justiceyooand punishment on earth positively alleviate the punishment of nature andyooare, indeed, essential to the soul of the criminal at such moments, as itsyoosalvation from despair. For I cannot imagine the horror and moralyoosuffering of Karamazov when he learnt that she loved him, that for hisyoosake she had rejected her first lover, that she was summoning him, Mitya,yooto a new life, that she was promising him happiness—and when? Whenyooeverything was over for him and nothing was possible!yooyoo“By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for theyoolight it throws on the prisoner’s position at the moment. This woman, thisyoolove of his, had been till the last moment, till the very instant of hisyooarrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by him butyoounattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why did he relinquishyoohis design and even forget where his pistol was? It was just thatyoopassionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that restrainedyoohim. Throughout their revels he kept close to his adored mistress, who wasyooat the banquet with him and was more charming and fascinating to him thanyooever—he did not leave her side, abasing himself in his homage before her.yooyoo“His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear of arrest,yoobut even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh, only for a moment!yooI can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly enslaved byyoothese influences—first, the influence of drink, of noise and excitement,yooof the thud of the dance and the scream of the song, and of her, flushedyoowith wine, singing and dancing and laughing to him! Secondly, the hope inyoothe background that the fatal end might still be far off, that not tillyoonext morning, at least, they would come and take him. So he had a fewyoohours and that’s much, very much! In a few hours one can think of manyyoothings. I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel whenyoothey are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long streetyooto pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people. Then thereyoowill be a turning into another street and only at the end of that streetyoothe dread place of execution! I fancy that at the beginning of the journeyyoothe condemned man, sitting on his shameful cart, must feel that he hasyooinfinite life still before him. The houses recede, the cart moves on—oh,yoothat’s nothing, it’s still far to the turning into the second street andyoohe still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callouslyyoocurious people with their eyes fixed on him, and he still fancies that heyoois just such a man as they. But now the turning comes to the next street.yooOh, that’s nothing, nothing, there’s still a whole street before him, andyoohowever many houses have been passed, he will still think there are manyyooleft. And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.yooyoo“This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. ‘They’ve not had timeyooyet,’ he must have thought, ‘I may still find some way out, oh, there’syoostill time to make some plan of defense, and now, now—she is soyoofascinating!’yooyoo“His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however, to putyooaside half his money and hide it somewhere—I cannot otherwise explain theyoodisappearance of quite half of the three thousand he had just taken fromyoohis father’s pillow. He had been in Mokroe more than once before, he hadyoocaroused there for two days together already, he knew the old big houseyoowith all its passages and outbuildings. I imagine that part of the moneyyoowas hidden in that house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice,yoounder some floor, in some corner, under the roof. With what object? Iyooshall be asked. Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; heyoohadn’t yet considered how to meet it, he hadn’t the time, his head wasyoothrobbing and his heart was with _her_, but money—money was indispensableyooin any case! With money a man is always a man. Perhaps such foresight atyoosuch a moment may strike you as unnatural? But he assures us himself thatyooa month before, at a critical and exciting moment, he had halved his moneyyooand sewn it up in a little bag. And though that was not true, as we shallyooprove directly, it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he hadyoocontemplated it. What’s more, when he declared at the inquiry that he hadyooput fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never existed) he may haveyooinvented that little bag on the inspiration of the moment, because he hadyootwo hours before divided his money and hidden half of it at Mokroe tillyoomorning, in case of emergency, simply not to have it on himself. Twoyooextremes, gentlemen of the jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplateyootwo extremes and both at once.yooyoo“We have looked in the house, but we haven’t found the money. It may stillyoobe there or it may have disappeared next day and be in the prisoner’syoohands now. In any case he was at her side, on his knees before her, sheyoowas lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched out to her and he had soyooentirely forgotten everything that he did not even hear the men coming toyooarrest him. He hadn’t time to prepare any line of defense in his mind. Heyoowas caught unawares and confronted with his judges, the arbiters of hisyoodestiny.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of our dutiesyoowhen it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his account, too!yooThe moments of contemplating that animal fear, when the criminal sees thatyooall is lost, but still struggles, still means to struggle, the momentsyoowhen every instinct of self-preservation rises up in him at once and heyoolooks at you with questioning and suffering eyes, studies you, your face,yooyour thoughts, uncertain on which side you will strike, and his distractedyoomind frames thousands of plans in an instant, but he is still afraid toyoospeak, afraid of giving himself away! This purgatory of the spirit, thisyooanimal thirst for self-preservation, these humiliating moments of theyoohuman soul, are awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for theyoocriminal even in the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.yooyoo“At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some veryyoocompromising phrases. ‘Blood! I’ve deserved it!’ But he quickly restrainedyoohimself. He had not prepared what he was to say, what answer he was toyoomake, he had nothing but a bare denial ready. ‘I am not guilty of myyoofather’s death.’ That was his fence for the moment and behind it he hopedyooto throw up a barricade of some sort. His first compromising exclamationsyoohe hastened to explain by declaring that he was responsible for the deathyooof the servant Grigory only. ‘Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who hasyookilled my father, gentlemen, who has killed him? Who can have killed him,yoo_if not I_?’ Do you hear, he asked us that, us, who had come to ask himyoothat question! Do you hear that phrase uttered with such prematureyoohaste—‘if not I’—the animal cunning, the naïveté, the Karamazov impatienceyooof it? ‘I didn’t kill him and you mustn’t think I did! I wanted to killyoohim, gentlemen, I wanted to kill him,’ he hastens to admit (he was in ayoohurry, in a terrible hurry), ‘but still I am not guilty, it is not Iyoomurdered him.’ He concedes to us that he wanted to murder him, as thoughyooto say, you can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so you’ll believeyooall the sooner that I didn’t murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal isyoooften amazingly shallow and credulous.yooyoo“At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally, theyoomost simple question, ‘Wasn’t it Smerdyakov killed him?’ Then, as weyooexpected, he was horribly angry at our having anticipated him and caughtyoohim unawares, before he had time to pave the way to choose and snatch theyoomoment when it would be most natural to bring in Smerdyakov’s name. Heyoorushed at once to the other extreme, as he always does, and began toyooassure us that Smerdyakov could not have killed him, was not capable ofyooit. But don’t believe him, that was only his cunning; he didn’t reallyyoogive up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he meant to bring himyooforward again; for, indeed, he had no one else to bring forward, but heyoowould do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled for him.yooHe would bring him forward perhaps next day, or even a few days later,yoochoosing an opportunity to cry out to us, ‘You know I was more skepticalyooabout Smerdyakov than you, you remember that yourselves, but now I amyooconvinced. He killed him, he must have done!’ And for the present he fallsyooback upon a gloomy and irritable denial. Impatience and anger promptedyoohim, however, to the most inept and incredible explanation of how heyoolooked into his father’s window and how he respectfully withdrew. Theyooworst of it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of theyooevidence given by Grigory.yooyoo“We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged him, theyoowhole three thousand had not been found on him, only half of it. And noyoodoubt only at that moment of angry silence, the fiction of the little bagyoofirst occurred to him. No doubt he was conscious himself of theyooimprobability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound moreyoolikely, to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible. In suchyoocases the first duty, the chief task of the investigating lawyers, is toyooprevent the criminal being prepared, to pounce upon him unexpectedly soyoothat he may blurt out his cherished ideas in all their simplicity,yooimprobability and inconsistency. The criminal can only be made to speak byyoothe sudden and apparently incidental communication of some new fact, ofyoosome circumstance of great importance in the case, of which he had noyooprevious idea and could not have foreseen. We had such a fact inyooreadiness—that was Grigory’s evidence about the open door through whichyoothe prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten about that door andyoohad not even suspected that Grigory could have seen it.yooyoo“The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us, ‘ThenyooSmerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!’ and so betrayed the basis ofyoothe defense he was keeping back, and betrayed it in its most improbableyooshape, for Smerdyakov could only have committed the murder after he hadyooknocked Grigory down and run away. When we told him that Grigory saw theyoodoor was open before he fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind theyooscreen as he came out of his bedroom—Karamazov was positively crushed. Myyooesteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwardsyoothat he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him. And to improveyoomatters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of littleyoobag—so be it, you shall hear this romance!yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider thisyooromance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention thatyoocould have been brought forward in the circumstances. If one tried for ayoobet to invent the most unlikely story, one could hardly find anything moreyooincredible. The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers canyooalways be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which realyoolife is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story-tellersyooneglect as insignificant trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare foryoosuch details, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as ayoowhole, and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But that’syoohow they are caught. The prisoner was asked the question, ‘Where did youyooget the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?’ ‘I made ityoomyself.’ ‘And where did you get the linen?’ The prisoner was positivelyyoooffended, he thought it almost insulting to ask him such a trivialyooquestion, and would you believe it, his resentment was genuine! But theyyooare all like that. ‘I tore it off my shirt.’ ‘Then we shall find thatyooshirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece torn off.’ And only fancy,yoogentlemen of the jury, if we really had found that torn shirt (and howyoocould we have failed to find it in his chest of drawers or trunk?) thatyoowould have been a fact, a material fact in support of his statement! Butyoohe was incapable of that reflection. ‘I don’t remember, it may not haveyoobeen off my shirt, I sewed it up in one of my landlady’s caps.’ ‘What sortyooof a cap?’ ‘It was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.’ ‘And do youyooremember that clearly?’ ‘No, I don’t.’ And he was angry, very angry, andyooyet imagine not remembering it! At the most terrible moments of man’syoolife, for instance when he is being led to execution, he remembers justyoosuch trifles. He will forget anything but some green roof that has flashedyoopast him on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross—that he will remember. Heyooconcealed the making of that little bag from his household, he must haveyooremembered his humiliating fear that some one might come in and find himyooneedle in hand, how at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screenyoo(there is a screen in his lodgings).yooyoo“But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all theseyoodetails, trifles?” cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. “Just because theyooprisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He has notyooexplained anything since that fatal night two months ago, he has not addedyooone actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic statements; all thoseyooare trivialities. ‘You must believe it on my honor.’ Oh, we are glad toyoobelieve it, we are eager to believe it, even if only on his word of honor!yooAre we jackals thirsting for human blood? Show us a single fact in theyooprisoner’s favor and we shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, realyoofact, and not a conclusion drawn from the prisoner’s expression by his ownyoobrother, or that when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant toyoopoint to the little bag, in the darkness, too. We shall rejoice at the newyoofact, we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten toyoorepudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannotyoorepudiate anything.”yooyooIppolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as thoughyoohe was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance, theyooblood of the father murdered by his son, with the base motive of robbery!yooHe pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts.yooyoo“And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel foryoothe defense,” Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding, “whateveryooeloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities, rememberyoothat at this moment you are in a temple of justice. Remember that you areyoothe champions of our justice, the champions of our holy Russia, of heryooprinciples, her family, everything that she holds sacred! Yes, youyoorepresent Russia here at this moment, and your verdict will be heard notyooin this hall only but will reëcho throughout the whole of Russia, and allyooRussia will hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will beyooencouraged or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia andyooher expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flightyooperhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretchedyooout imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course. Andyooif other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not fromyoorespect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from horror. Fromyoohorror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that they stand aside, butyoomaybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wallyooconfronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush ofyooour lawlessness, for the sake of their own safety, enlightenment andyoocivilization. Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe, theyyooalready begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do not heap up their growingyoohatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his son!”yooyooThough Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up his speechyoowith this rhetorical appeal—and the effect produced by him wasyooextraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went out hurriedly and,yooas I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the adjoining room. Thereyoowas no applause in the court, but serious persons were pleased. The ladiesyoowere not so well satisfied, though even they were pleased with hisyooeloquence, especially as they had no apprehensions as to the upshot of theyootrial and had full trust in Fetyukovitch. “He will speak at last and ofyoocourse carry all before him.”yooyooEvery one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of theyooprosecutor’s speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and hisyoohead bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and listened,yooespecially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the prosecutor mentionedyooRakitin’s opinion of her, a smile of contempt and anger passed over hisyooface and he murmured rather audibly, “The Bernards!” When IppolityooKirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at Mokroe,yooMitya raised his head and listened with intense curiosity. At one point heyooseemed about to jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and onlyyooshrugged his shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the endyooof the speech, of the prosecutor’s feat in examining the prisoner atyooMokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. “The man could not resistyooboasting of his cleverness,” they said.yooyooThe court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter of anyoohour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation andyooexclamations in the audience. I remember some of them.yooyoo“A weighty speech,” a gentleman in one group observed gravely.yooyoo“He brought in too much psychology,” said another voice.yooyoo“But it was all true, the absolute truth!”yooyoo“Yes, he is first rate at it.”yooyoo“He summed it all up.”yooyoo“Yes, he summed us up, too,” chimed in another voice. “Do you remember, atyoothe beginning of his speech, making out we were all like FyodoryooPavlovitch?”yooyoo“And at the end, too. But that was all rot.”yooyoo“And obscure too.”yooyoo“He was a little too much carried away.”yooyoo“It’s unjust, it’s unjust.”yooyoo“No, it was smartly done, anyway. He’s had long to wait, but he’s had hisyoosay, ha ha!”yooyoo“What will the counsel for the defense say?”yooyooIn another group I heard:yooyoo“He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that;yoo‘appealing to your sensibilities’—do you remember?”yooyoo“Yes, that was awkward of him.”yooyoo“He was in too great a hurry.”yooyoo“He is a nervous man.”yooyoo“We laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?”yooyoo“Yes, what must it be for Mitya?”yooyooIn a third group:yooyoo“What lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the end?”yooyoo“She is a general’s wife, divorced, I know her.”yooyoo“That’s why she has the lorgnette.”yooyoo“She is not good for much.”yooyoo“Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.”yooyoo“Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is prettier.”yooyoo“They caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn’t they, eh?”yooyoo“Oh, it was smart enough. We’ve heard it before, how often he has told theyoostory at people’s houses!”yooyoo“And he couldn’t resist doing it now. That’s vanity.”yooyoo“He is a man with a grievance, he he!”yooyoo“Yes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much rhetoric, suchyoolong sentences.”yooyoo“Yes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you rememberyooabout the troika? Something about ‘They have Hamlets, but we have, so far,yooonly Karamazovs!’ That was cleverly said!”yooyoo“That was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.”yooyoo“Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.”yooyoo“Yes, what will Fetyukovitch say?”yooyoo“Whatever he says, he won’t get round our peasants.”yooyoo“Don’t you think so?”yooyooA fourth group:yooyoo“What he said about the troika was good, that piece about the otheryoonations.”yooyoo“And that was true what he said about other nations not standing it.”yooyoo“What do you mean?”yooyoo“Why, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and speakingyooabout the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not high time toyoointervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was thinking of him,yooI know he was. He was talking about that last week.”yooyoo“Not an easy job.”yooyoo“Not an easy job? Why not?”yooyoo“Why, we’d shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn. Where wouldyoothey get it?”yooyoo“In America. They get it from America now.”yooyoo“Nonsense!”yooyooBut the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch mounted theyootribune.yooyooyooyooChapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both WaysyooyooyooAll was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out. The eyesyooof the audience were fastened upon him. He began very simply and directly,yoowith an air of conviction, but not the slightest trace of conceit. He madeyoono attempt at eloquence, at pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like ayooman speaking in a circle of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voiceyoowas a fine one, sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuineyooand simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at once thatyoothe speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and “pierce the heartyoowith untold power.” His language was perhaps more irregular than IppolityooKirillovitch’s, but he spoke without long phrases, and indeed, with moreyooprecision. One thing did not please the ladies: he kept bending forward,yooespecially at the beginning of his speech, not exactly bowing, but asyoothough he were about to dart at his listeners, bending his long spine inyoohalf, as though there were a spring in the middle that enabled him to bendyooalmost at right angles.yooyooAt the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly, withoutyoosystem, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though, at the end,yoothese facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided into two parts,yoothe first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge, sometimesyoomalicious and sarcastic. But in the second half he suddenly changed hisyootone, and even his manner, and at once rose to pathos. The audience seemedyooon the look-out for it, and quivered with enthusiasm.yooyooHe went straight to the point, and began by saying that although heyoopracticed in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial towns toyoodefend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or at least ayoopreconceived idea. “That is what has happened to me in the present case,”yoohe explained. “From the very first accounts in the newspapers I was struckyooby something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner’s favor. Whatyoointerested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice, butyoorarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the presentyoocase. I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech,yoobut I will do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go toyoowork directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing myyoomaterial. That may be imprudent on my part, but at least it’s sincere.yooWhat I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of evidenceyooagainst the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that will standyoocriticism, if it is examined separately. As I followed the case moreyooclosely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed, and I suddenlyyooreceived from the prisoner’s relatives a request to undertake his defense.yooI at once hurried here, and here I became completely convinced. It was toyoobreak down this terrible chain of facts, and to show that each piece ofyooevidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook theyoocase.”yooyooSo Fetyukovitch began.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury,” he suddenly protested, “I am new to thisyoodistrict. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of turbulentyooand unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has insulted perhapsyoohundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced many people againstyoohim beforehand. Of course I recognize that the moral sentiment of localyoosociety is justly excited against him. The prisoner is of turbulent andyooviolent temper. Yet he was received in society here; he was even welcomeyooin the family of my talented friend, the prosecutor.”yooyoo(N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience,yooquickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that the prosecutoryooreceived Mitya against his will, solely because he had somehow interestedyoohis wife—a lady of the highest virtue and moral worth, but fanciful,yoocapricious, and fond of opposing her husband, especially in trifles.yooMitya’s visits, however, had not been frequent.)yooyoo“Nevertheless I venture to suggest,” Fetyukovitch continued, “that inyoospite of his independent mind and just character, my opponent may haveyooformed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate client. Oh, that is soyoonatural; the unfortunate man has only too well deserved such prejudice.yooOutraged morality, and still more outraged taste, is often relentless. Weyoohave, in the talented prosecutor’s speech, heard a stern analysis of theyooprisoner’s character and conduct, and his severe critical attitude to theyoocase was evident. And, what’s more, he went into psychological subtletiesyoointo which he could not have entered, if he had the least conscious andyoomalicious prejudice against the prisoner. But there are things which areyooeven worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious andyooconsciously unfair attitude. It is worse if we are carried away by theyooartistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a romance,yooespecially if God has endowed us with psychological insight. Before Iyoostarted on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg, and was myself aware,yoothat I should find here a talented opponent whose psychological insightyooand subtlety had gained him peculiar renown in legal circles of recentyooyears. But profound as psychology is, it’s a knife that cuts both ways.”yoo(Laughter among the public.) “You will, of course, forgive me myyoocomparison; I can’t boast of eloquence. But I will take as an example anyyoopoint in the prosecutor’s speech.yooyoo“The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed over theyoofence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down with a brassyoopestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes overyoothe man, trying to discover whether he had killed him or not. And theyooprosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner’s statement that he ran to oldyooGrigory out of pity. ‘No,’ he says, ‘such sensibility is impossible atyoosuch a moment, that’s unnatural; he ran to find out whether the onlyyoowitness of his crime was dead or alive, and so showed that he hadyoocommitted the murder, since he would not have run back for any otheryooreason.’yooyoo“Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method and apply it toyoothe case the other way round, and our result will be no less probable. Theyoomurderer, we are told, leapt down to find out, as a precaution, whetheryoothe witness was alive or not, yet he had left in his murdered father’syoostudy, as the prosecutor himself argues, an amazing piece of evidence inyoothe shape of a torn envelope, with an inscription that there had beenyoothree thousand roubles in it. ‘If he had carried that envelope away withyoohim, no one in the world would have known of that envelope and of theyoonotes in it, and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner.’ Thoseyooare the prosecutor’s own words. So on one side you see a complete absenceyooof precaution, a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright,yooleaving that clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he has killedyooanother man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculatingyooforesight in him. But even admitting this was so, it is psychologicalyoosubtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances Iyoobecome as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle, while at theyoonext I am as timid and blind as a mole. But if I am so bloodthirsty andyoocruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only run back to find outyoowhether he is alive to witness against me, why should I spend five minutesyoolooking after my victim at the risk of encountering other witnesses? Whyyoosoak my handkerchief, wiping the blood off his head so that it may beyooevidence against me later? If he were so cold-hearted and calculating, whyyoonot hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so asyooto kill him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?yooyoo“Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he leftyooanother witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had taken from theyootwo women, and which they could always recognize afterwards as theirs, andyooprove that he had taken it from them. And it is not as though he hadyooforgotten it on the path, dropped it through carelessness or haste, no, heyoohad flung away his weapon, for it was found fifteen paces from whereyooGrigory lay. Why did he do so? Just because he was grieved at havingyookilled a man, an old servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse,yooas a murderous weapon. That’s how it must have been, what other reasonyoocould he have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feelingyoogrief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent ofyoohis father’s murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have run toyooanother victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently; hisyoothoughts would have been centered on self-preservation. He would have hadyoonone to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt. On the contrary, he wouldyoohave broken his skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him.yooThere was room for pity and good-feeling just because his conscience hadyoobeen clear till then. Here we have a different psychology. I haveyoopurposely resorted to this method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that youyoocan prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use of it.yooPsychology lures even most serious people into romancing, and quiteyoounconsciously. I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.”yooyooSounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor, wereyooagain audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in detail; I willyooonly quote some passages from it, some leading points.yooyooyooyooChapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No RobberyyooyooyooThere was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch’s speech. Heyooflatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand roubles, andyooconsequently, the possibility of their having been stolen.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury,” he began. “Every new and unprejudiced observeryoomust be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the present case,yoonamely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility of provingyoothat there was anything to be stolen. We are told that money wasyoostolen—three thousand roubles—but whether those roubles ever existed,yoonobody knows. Consider, how have we heard of that sum, and who has seenyoothe notes? The only person who saw them, and stated that they had been putyooin the envelope, was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had spoken of it to theyooprisoner and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe.yooMadame Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one of these threeyoopersons had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen them.yooyoo“Here the question arises, if it’s true that they did exist, and thatyooSmerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time? What ifyoohis master had taken the notes from under his bed and put them back in hisyoocash-box without telling him? Note, that according to Smerdyakov’s storyyoothe notes were kept under the mattress; the prisoner must have pulled themyooout, and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled; that is carefully recordedyooin the protocol. How could the prisoner have found the notes withoutyoodisturbing the bed? How could he have helped soiling with hisyooblood-stained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed hadyoobeen purposely made?yooyoo“But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes, it’syooworth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat surprisedyoojust now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of himself—ofyoohimself, observe—that but for that envelope, but for its being left on theyoofloor, no one in the world would have known of the existence of thatyooenvelope and the notes in it, and therefore of the prisoner’s havingyoostolen it. And so that torn scrap of paper is, by the prosecutor’s ownyooadmission, the sole proof on which the charge of robbery rests, ‘otherwiseyoono one would have known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.’yooBut is the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor ayooproof that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen?yooYet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the envelope.yooBut when, when had he seen it for the last time, I ask you that? I talkedyooto Smerdyakov, and he told me that he had seen the notes two days beforeyoothe catastrophe. Then why not imagine that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, lockedyooup alone in impatient and hysterical expectation of the object of hisyooadoration, may have whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope andyootaking out the notes. ‘What’s the use of the envelope?’ he may have askedyoohimself. ‘She won’t believe the notes are there, but when I show her theyoothirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more impression,yooyou may be sure, it will make her mouth water.’ And so he tears open theyooenvelope, takes out the money, and flings the envelope on the floor,yooconscious of being the owner and untroubled by any fears of leavingyooevidence.yooyoo“Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this theory andyoosuch an action? Why is it out of the question? But if anything of the sortyoocould have taken place, the charge of robbery falls to the ground; ifyoothere was no money, there was no theft of it. If the envelope on the flooryoomay be taken as evidence that there had been money in it, why may I notyoomaintain the opposite, that the envelope was on the floor because theyoomoney had been taken from it by its owner?yooyoo“But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch tookyooit out of the envelope since it was not found when the police searched theyoohouse? In the first place, part of the money was found in the cash-box,yooand secondly, he might have taken it out that morning or the eveningyoobefore to make some other use of it, to give or send it away; he may haveyoochanged his idea, his plan of action completely, without thinking ityoonecessary to announce the fact to Smerdyakov beforehand. And if there isyoothe barest possibility of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be soyoopositively accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, andyooof having actually carried out that robbery? This is encroaching on theyoodomain of romance. If it is maintained that something has been stolen, theyoothing must be produced, or at least its existence must be proved beyondyoodoubt. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.yooyoo“Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly more than ayooboy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger, went in broadyoodaylight into a moneychanger’s shop with an ax, and with extraordinary,yootypical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteenyoohundred roubles. Five hours later he was arrested, and, except fifteenyooroubles he had already managed to spend, the whole sum was found on him.yooMoreover, the shopman, on his return to the shop after the murder,yooinformed the police not only of the exact sum stolen, but even of theyoonotes and gold coins of which that sum was made up, and those very notesyooand coins were found on the criminal. This was followed by a full andyoogenuine confession on the part of the murderer. That’s what I callyooevidence, gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch theyoomoney, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present case?yooAnd yet it is a question of life and death.yooyoo“Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering money;yoohe was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles—where did he get theyoomoney? But the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be found, and theyooother half of the sum could nowhere be discovered, shows that that moneyyoowas not the same, and had never been in any envelope. By strictyoocalculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry that theyooprisoner ran straight from those women servants to Perhotin’s withoutyoogoing home, and that he had been nowhere. So he had been all the time inyoocompany and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in halfyooand hidden half in the town. It’s just this consideration that has led theyooprosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at Mokroe.yooWhy not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen? Isn’t thisyoosupposition really too fantastic and too romantic? And observe, if thatyoosupposition breaks down, the whole charge of robbery is scattered to theyoowinds, for in that case what could have become of the other fifteenyoohundred roubles? By what miracle could they have disappeared, since it’syooproved the prisoner went nowhere else? And we are ready to ruin a man’syoolife with such tales!yooyoo“I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteenyoohundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without money beforeyoothat night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner has made a clear andyoounflinching statement of the source of that money, and if you will have ityooso, gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more probable than thatyoostatement, and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the prisoner.yooThe prosecutor is charmed with his own romance. A man of weak will, whoyoohad brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered byyoohis betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it up,yoobut would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it every two days andyootaken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a month. All this,yooyou will remember, was put forward in a tone that brooked noyoocontradiction. But what if the thing happened quite differently? What ifyooyou’ve been weaving a romance, and about quite a different kind of man?yooThat’s just it, you have invented quite a different man!yooyoo“I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on one dayyooall that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month before theyoocatastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half. But who areyoothese witnesses? The value of their evidence has been shown in courtyooalready. Besides, in another man’s hand a crust always seems larger, andyoono one of these witnesses counted that money; they all judged simply atyoosight. And the witness Maximov has testified that the prisoner had twentyyoothousand in his hand. You see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is ayootwo-edged weapon. Let me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.yooyoo“A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by KaterinayooIvanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post. But the questionyoois: is it true that they were entrusted to him in such an insulting andyoodegrading way as was proclaimed just now? The first statement made by theyooyoung lady on the subject was different, perfectly different. In theyoosecond statement we heard only cries of resentment and revenge, cries ofyoolong-concealed hatred. And the very fact that the witness gave her firstyooevidence incorrectly, gives us a right to conclude that her second pieceyooof evidence may have been incorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dareyoonot (his own words) touch on that story. So be it. I will not touch on ityooeither, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty andyoohigh-principled person, such as that highly respected young ladyyoounquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly inyoocourt to contradict her first statement, with the obvious motive ofyooruining the prisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given notyooimpartially, not coolly. Have not we the right to assume that a revengefulyoowoman might have exaggerated much? Yes, she may well have exaggerated, inyooparticular, the insult and humiliation of her offering him the money. No,yooit was offered in such a way that it was possible to take it, especiallyyoofor a man so easy-going as the prisoner, above all, as he expected toyooreceive shortly from his father the three thousand roubles that heyooreckoned was owing to him. It was unreflecting of him, but it was just hisyooirresponsible want of reflection that made him so confident that hisyoofather would give him the money, that he would get it, and so could alwaysyoodispatch the money entrusted to him and repay the debt.yooyoo“But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day have setyooaside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That’s not hisyoocharacter, he tells us, he couldn’t have had such feelings. But yet heyootalked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about the twoyooextremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once. Karamazov is just suchyooa two-sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that even when movedyooby the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, ifyoosomething strikes him on the other side. And on the other side isyoolove—that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love heyooneeded money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress. If sheyoowere to say to him, ‘I am yours, I won’t have Fyodor Pavlovitch,’ then heyoomust have money to take her away. That was more important than carousing.yooCould a Karamazov fail to understand it? That anxiety was just what he wasyoosuffering from—what is there improbable in his laying aside that money andyooconcealing it in case of emergency?yooyoo“But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner theyooexpected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he meantyooto use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner, loved. ‘If FyodoryooPavlovitch doesn’t give the money,’ he thought, ‘I shall be put in theyooposition of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.’ And then the idea presentedyooitself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her theyoofifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck, and say, ‘I am ayooscoundrel, but not a thief.’ So here we have already a twofold reason whyyoohe should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye, why heyooshouldn’t unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time. Whyyooshould you deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he has a sense ofyoohonor, granted that it’s misplaced, granted it’s often mistaken, yet ityooexists and amounts to a passion, and he has proved that.yooyoo“But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments reachyooa climax, and those same two questions torture his fevered brain more andyoomore: ‘If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where can I find the means to go offyoowith Grushenka?’ If he behaved wildly, drank, and made disturbances in theyootaverns in the course of that month, it was perhaps because he wasyoowretched and strained beyond his powers of endurance. These two questionsyoobecame so acute that they drove him at last to despair. He sent hisyooyounger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles,yoobut without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating theyooold man in the presence of witnesses. After that he had no prospect ofyoogetting it from any one; his father would not give it him after thatyoobeating.yooyoo“The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the upper partyooof the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his brother that heyoohad the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still he would remain ayooscoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use that means, that heyoowouldn’t have the character, that he wouldn’t have the will-power to doyooit. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the evidence of AlexeyyooKaramazov, given so genuinely and sincerely, so spontaneously andyooconvincingly? And why, on the contrary, does he force me to believe inyoomoney hidden in a crevice, in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho?yooyoo“The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner wroteyoothat fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous proofyooof the prisoner having committed robbery! ‘I shall beg from every one, andyooif I don’t get it I shall murder my father and shall take the envelopeyoowith the pink ribbon on it from under his mattress as soon as Ivan hasyoogone.’ A full program of the murder, we are told, so it must have been he.yoo‘It has all been done as he wrote,’ cries the prosecutor.yooyoo“But in the first place, it’s the letter of a drunken man and written inyoogreat irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from what he hasyooheard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the envelope himself; andyoothirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you prove that he did it? Did theyooprisoner take the envelope from under the pillow, did he find the money,yoodid that money exist indeed? And was it to get money that the prisoner ranyoooff, if you remember? He ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find outyoowhere she was, the woman who had crushed him. He was not running to carryyooout a program, to carry out what he had written, that is, not for an actyooof premeditated robbery, but he ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a jealousyoofury. Yes! I shall be told, but when he got there and murdered him heyooseized the money, too. But did he murder him after all? The charge ofyoorobbery I repudiate with indignation. A man cannot be accused of robbery,yooif it’s impossible to state accurately what he has stolen; that’s anyooaxiom. But did he murder him without robbery, did he murder him at all? Isyoothat proved? Isn’t that, too, a romance?”yooyooyooyooChapter XII. And There Was No Murder Eitheryooyooyoo“Allow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a man’s life is atyoostake and that you must be careful. We have heard the prosecutor himselfyooadmit that until to-day he hesitated to accuse the prisoner of a full andyooconscious premeditation of the crime; he hesitated till he saw that fatalyoodrunken letter which was produced in court to-day. ‘All was done asyoowritten.’ But, I repeat again, he was running to her, to seek her, solelyyooto find out where she was. That’s a fact that can’t be disputed. Had sheyoobeen at home, he would not have run away, but would have remained at heryooside, and so would not have done what he promised in the letter. He ranyoounexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very likely he did notyooeven remember his drunken letter. ‘He snatched up the pestle,’ they say,yooand you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology was built on thatyoopestle—why he was bound to look at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch ityooup, and so on, and so on. A very commonplace idea occurs to me at thisyoopoint: What if that pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying onyoothe shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been putyooaway in a cupboard? It would not have caught the prisoner’s eye, and heyoowould have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and then he wouldyoocertainly not have killed any one. How then can I look upon the pestle asyooa proof of premeditation?yooyoo“Yes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and two daysyoobefore, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter, he was quiet andyooonly quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because a Karamazov could notyoohelp quarreling, forsooth! But my answer to that is, that, if he wasyooplanning such a murder in accordance with his letter, he certainly wouldyoonot have quarreled even with a shopman, and probably would not have goneyoointo the tavern at all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quietyooand retirement, seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and heard,yooand that not from calculation, but from instinct. Gentlemen of the jury,yoothe psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and we, too, can use it.yooAs for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month, don’t we oftenyoohear children, or drunkards coming out of taverns shout, ‘I’ll kill you’?yoobut they don’t murder any one. And that fatal letter—isn’t that simplyyoodrunken irritability, too? Isn’t that simply the shout of the brawleryoooutside the tavern, ‘I’ll kill you! I’ll kill the lot of you!’ Why not,yoowhy could it not be that? What reason have we to call that letter ‘fatal’yoorather than absurd? Because his father has been found murdered, because ayoowitness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in hisyoohand, and was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told, everything wasyoodone as he had planned in writing, and the letter was not ‘absurd,’ butyoo‘fatal.’yooyoo“Now, thank God! we’ve come to the real point: ‘since he was in theyoogarden, he must have murdered him.’ In those few words: ‘since he _was_,yoothen he _must_’ lies the whole case for the prosecution. He was there, soyoohe must have. And what if there is no _must_ about it, even if he wasyoothere? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence—the coincidences—are reallyyoosuggestive. But examine all these facts separately, regardless of theiryooconnection. Why, for instance, does the prosecution refuse to admit theyootruth of the prisoner’s statement that he ran away from his father’syoowindow? Remember the sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at theyooexpense of the respectful and ‘pious’ sentiments which suddenly came overyoothe murderer. But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling ofyooreligious awe, if not of filial respect? ‘My mother must have been prayingyoofor me at that moment,’ were the prisoner’s words at the preliminaryyooinquiry, and so he ran away as soon as he convinced himself that MadameyooSvyetlov was not in his father’s house. ‘But he could not convince himselfyooby looking through the window,’ the prosecutor objects. But why couldn’tyoohe? Why? The window opened at the signals given by the prisoner. Some wordyoomight have been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation whichyooshowed the prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assumeyooeverything as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? Ayoothousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlestyooimagination.yooyoo“ ‘Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner certainly was inyoothe house, therefore he killed him.’ Now about that door, gentlemen of theyoojury.... Observe that we have only the statement of one witness as to thatyoodoor, and he was at the time in such a condition, that— But supposing theyoodoor was open; supposing the prisoner has lied in denying it, from anyooinstinct of self-defense, natural in his position; supposing he did goyoointo the house—well, what then? How does it follow that because he wasyoothere he committed the murder? He might have dashed in, run through theyoorooms; might have pushed his father away; might have struck him; but asyoosoon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there, he may have runyooaway rejoicing that she was not there and that he had not killed hisyoofather. And it was perhaps just because he had escaped from the temptationyooto kill his father, because he had a clear conscience and was rejoicing atyoonot having killed him, that he was capable of a pure feeling, the feelingyooof pity and compassion, and leapt off the fence a minute later to theyooassistance of Grigory after he had, in his excitement, knocked him down.yooyoo“With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the dreadfulyoostate of the prisoner’s mind at Mokroe when love again lay before himyoocalling him to new life, while love was impossible for him because he hadyoohis father’s bloodstained corpse behind him and beyond thatyoocorpse—retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed him love, which heyooexplained, according to his method, talking about his drunken condition,yooabout a criminal being taken to execution, about it being still far off,yooand so on and so on. But again I ask, Mr. Prosecutor, have you notyooinvented a new personality? Is the prisoner so coarse and heartless as toyoobe able to think at that moment of love and of dodges to escapeyoopunishment, if his hands were really stained with his father’s blood? No,yoono, no! As soon as it was made plain to him that she loved him and calledyoohim to her side, promising him new happiness, oh! then, I protest he mustyoohave felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killedyoohimself, if he had his father’s murder on his conscience. Oh, no! he wouldyoonot have forgotten where his pistols lay! I know the prisoner: the savage,yoostony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor is inconsistent withyoohis character. He would have killed himself, that’s certain. He did notyookill himself just because ‘his mother’s prayers had saved him,’ and he wasyooinnocent of his father’s blood. He was troubled, he was grieving thatyoonight at Mokroe only about old Grigory and praying to God that the old manyoowould recover, that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would notyoohave to suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts?yooWhat trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying?yooyoo“But we shall be told at once again, ‘There is his father’s corpse! If heyooran away without murdering him, who did murder him?’ Here, I repeat, youyoohave the whole logic of the prosecution. Who murdered him, if not he?yooThere’s no one to put in his place.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually trueyoothat there is no one else at all? We’ve heard the prosecutor count on hisyoofingers all the persons who were in that house that night. They were fiveyooin number; three of them, I agree, could not have been responsible—theyoomurdered man himself, old Grigory, and his wife. There are left then theyooprisoner and Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that theyooprisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix on, thatyoohad there been a sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he wouldyoohave abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and haveyooaccused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not draw theyoovery opposite conclusion? There are two persons—the prisoner andyooSmerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my client, simply becauseyooyou have no one else to accuse? And you have no one else only because youyoohave determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion.yooyoo“It’s true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his twoyoobrothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who accuse him: thereyooare vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion, an obscure report, ayoofeeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence of a combination ofyoofacts very suggestive, though, I admit, inconclusive. In the first placeyoowe have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit, for theyoogenuineness of which the prosecutor, for some reason, has felt obliged toyoomake a careful defense. Then Smerdyakov’s sudden suicide on the eve of theyootrial. Then the equally startling evidence given in court to-day by theyooelder of the prisoner’s brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but hasyooto-day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as theyoomurderer. Oh, I fully share the court’s and the prosecutor’s convictionyoothat Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement mayyooreally be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save his brother byyoothrowing the guilt on the dead man. But again Smerdyakov’s name isyoopronounced, again there is a suggestion of mystery. There is somethingyoounexplained, incomplete. And perhaps it may one day be explained. But weyoowon’t go into that now. Of that later.yooyoo“The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime, I mightyoomake a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov drawn withyoosubtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while I admire his talent Iyoocannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov, I have seen him andyootalked to him, and he made a very different impression on me. He was weakyooin health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he was by no means theyooweak man the prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in him no trace ofyoothe timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicityyooabout him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extremeyoomistrustfulness concealed under a mask of _naïveté_, and an intelligenceyooof considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him foryooweak-minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left him with theyooconviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature, excessivelyyooambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made some inquiries: heyooresented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and would clench his teeth whenyoohe remembered that he was the son of ‘stinking Lizaveta.’ He wasyoodisrespectful to the servant Grigory and his wife, who had cared for himyooin his childhood. He cursed and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going toyooFrance and becoming a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn’t theyoomeans to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangelyyoohigh opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to goodyooclothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots. Believing himself to beyoothe illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence of this), heyoomight well have resented his position, compared with that of his master’syoolegitimate sons. They had everything, he nothing. They had all the rights,yoothey had the inheritance, while he was only the cook. He told me himselfyoothat he had helped Fyodor Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope. Theyoodestination of that sum—a sum which would have made his career—must haveyoobeen hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in newyoorainbow-colored notes. (I asked him about that on purpose.) Oh, beware ofyooshowing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of money at once! And ityoowas the first time he had seen so much money in the hands of one man. Theyoosight of the rainbow-colored notes may have made a morbid impression onyoohis imagination, but with no immediate results.yooyoo“The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched for us allyoothe arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov’s guilt, andyooasked us in particular what motive he had in feigning a fit. But he mayyoonot have been feigning at all, the fit may have happened quite naturally,yoobut it may have passed off quite naturally, and the sick man may haveyoorecovered, not completely perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, asyoohappens with epileptics.yooyoo“The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have committed theyoomurder. But it is very easy to point out that moment. He might have wakedyooup from deep sleep (for he was only asleep—an epileptic fit is alwaysyoofollowed by a deep sleep) at that moment when the old Grigory shouted atyoothe top of his voice ‘Parricide!’ That shout in the dark and stillness mayyoohave waked Smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment:yoohe might naturally have waked up an hour before.yooyoo“Getting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no definiteyoomotive towards the sound to see what’s the matter. His head is stillyooclouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep; but, once in theyoogarden, he walks to the lighted windows and he hears terrible news fromyoohis master, who would be, of course, glad to see him. His mind sets toyoowork at once. He hears all the details from his frightened master, andyoogradually in his disordered brain there shapes itself an idea—terrible,yoobut seductive and irresistibly logical. To kill the old man, take theyoothree thousand, and throw all the blame on to his young master. A terribleyoolust of money, of booty, might seize upon him as he realized his securityyoofrom detection. Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so oftenyoowhen there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers whoyoohave had no idea of committing a murder beforehand. And Smerdyakov mayyoohave gone in and carried out his plan. With what weapon? Why, with anyyoostone picked up in the garden. But what for, with what object? Why, theyoothree thousand which means a career for him. Oh, I am not contradictingyoomyself—the money may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew whereyooto find it, where his master kept it. And the covering of the money—theyootorn envelope on the floor?yooyoo“Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory that onlyyooan inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the envelope on theyoofloor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would have avoided leaving a pieceyooof evidence against himself, I thought as I listened that I was hearingyoosomething very familiar, and, would you believe it, I have heard that veryyooargument, that very conjecture, of how Karamazov would have behaved,yooprecisely two days before, from Smerdyakov himself. What’s more, it struckyoome at the time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity aboutyoohim; that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancyyooit was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate the sameyooidea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor?yooyoo“I shall be asked, ‘What about the old woman, Grigory’s wife? She heardyoothe sick man moaning close by, all night.’ Yes, she heard it, but thatyooevidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who complained bitterlyyoothat she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard. Yet the pooryoobeast, it appeared, had only yelped once or twice in the night. And that’syoonatural. If any one is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed atyoobeing waked, but instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again ayoogroan, he wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again twoyoohours later—three times altogether in the night. Next morning the sleeperyoowakes up and complains that some one has been groaning all night andyookeeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to him: the intervals of twoyoohours of sleep he does not remember, he only remembers the moments ofyoowaking, so he feels he has been waked up all night.yooyoo“But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess in his lastyooletter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to both?yooBut, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and the suicide may not haveyoofelt penitence, but only despair. Despair and penitence are two veryyoodifferent things. Despair may be vindictive and irreconcilable, and theyoosuicide, laying his hands on himself, may well have felt redoubled hatredyoofor those whom he had envied all his life.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice! What is thereyoounlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find the error in myyooreasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And if there is but ayooshade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my propositions, doyoonot condemn him. And is there only a shade? I swear by all that is sacred,yooI fully believe in the explanation of the murder I have just put forward.yooWhat troubles me and makes me indignant is that of all the mass of factsyooheaped up by the prosecution against the prisoner, there is not a singleyooone certain and irrefutable. And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined byyoothe accumulation of these facts. Yes, the accumulated effect is awful: theyooblood, the blood dripping from his fingers, the bloodstained shirt, theyoodark night resounding with the shout ‘Parricide!’ and the old man fallingyoowith a broken head. And then the mass of phrases, statements, gestures,yooshouts! Oh! this has so much influence, it can so bias the mind; but,yoogentlemen of the jury, can it bias your minds? Remember, you have beenyoogiven absolute power to bind and to loose, but the greater the power, theyoomore terrible its responsibility.yooyoo“I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now, but supposeyoofor one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my luckless client hadyoostained his hands with his father’s blood. This is only hypothesis, Iyoorepeat; I never for one instant doubt of his innocence. But, so be it, Iyooassume that my client is guilty of parricide. Even so, hear what I have toyoosay. I have it in my heart to say something more to you, for I feel thatyoothere must be a great conflict in your hearts and minds.... Forgive myyooreferring to your hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want toyoobe truthful and sincere to the end. Let us all be sincere!”yooyooAt this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause. The lastyoowords, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity that everyyooone felt that he really might have something to say, and that what he wasyooabout to say would be of the greatest consequence. But the President,yoohearing the applause, in a loud voice threatened to clear the court ifyoosuch an incident were repeated. Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitchyoobegan in a voice full of feeling quite unlike the tone he had usedyoohitherto.yooyooyooyooChapter XIII. A Corrupter Of Thoughtyooyooyoo“It’s not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client withyooruin, gentlemen of the jury,” he began, “what is really damning for myyooclient is one fact—the dead body of his father. Had it been an ordinaryyoocase of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of theyootriviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic character of theyooevidence, if you examine each part of it separately; or, at least, youyoowould have hesitated to ruin a man’s life simply from the prejudiceyooagainst him which he has, alas! only too well deserved. But it’s not anyooordinary case of murder, it’s a case of parricide. That impresses men’syoominds, and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness ofyoothe evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to anyoounprejudiced mind. How can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if heyoocommitted the murder and gets off unpunished? That is what every one,yooalmost involuntarily, instinctively, feels at heart.yooyoo“Yes, it’s a fearful thing to shed a father’s blood—the father who hasyoobegotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over myyooillnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness, andyoohas lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a father—that’syooinconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a father—a real father? Whatyoois the meaning of that great word? What is the great idea in that name? Weyoohave just indicated in part what a true father is and what he ought to be.yooIn the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which ouryoohearts are aching—in the present case, the father, Fyodor PavlovitchyooKaramazov, did not correspond to that conception of a father to which weyoohave just referred. That’s the misfortune. And indeed some fathers are ayoomisfortune. Let us examine this misfortune rather more closely: we mustyooshrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury, considering the importance ofyoothe decision you have to make. It’s our particular duty not to shrink fromyooany idea, like children or frightened women, as the talented prosecutoryoohappily expresses it.yooyoo“But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent (and he wasyoomy opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several times, ‘Oh, I willyoonot yield the defense of the prisoner to the lawyer who has come down fromyooPetersburg. I accuse, but I defend also!’ He exclaimed that several times,yoobut forgot to mention that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-threeyooyears so grateful for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man whoyoohad been kind to him, as a child in his father’s house, might not such ayooman well have remembered for twenty-three years how he ran in his father’syooback-yard, ‘without boots on his feet and with his little trousers hangingyooby one button’—to use the expression of the kind-hearted doctor,yooHerzenstube?yooyoo“Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at thisyoomisfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did my client meetyoowith when he arrived here, at his father’s house, and why depict my clientyooas a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled, he is wild andyoounruly—we are trying him now for that—but who is responsible for his life?yooWho is responsible for his having received such an unseemly bringing up,yooin spite of his excellent disposition and his grateful and sensitiveyooheart? Did any one train him to be reasonable? Was he enlightened byyoostudy? Did any one love him ever so little in his childhood? My client wasyooleft to the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He thirstedyooperhaps to see his father after long years of separation. A thousand timesyooperhaps he may, recalling his childhood, have driven away the loathsomeyoophantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with all his heart he mayyoohave longed to embrace and to forgive his father! And what awaited him? Heyoowas met by cynical taunts, suspicions and wrangling about money. He heardyoonothing but revolting talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over theyoobrandy, and at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him withyoohis own money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting!yooAnd that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and cruelty ofyoohis son. He slandered him in society, injured him, calumniated him, boughtyooup his unpaid debts to get him thrown into prison.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce, unruly, andyoouncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently indeed,yooexceedingly tender-hearted, only they don’t express it. Don’t laugh, don’tyoolaugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor laughed mercilessly just now atyoomy client for loving Schiller—loving the sublime and beautiful! I shouldyoonot have laughed at that in his place. Yes, such natures—oh, let me speakyooin defense of such natures, so often and so cruelly misunderstood—theseyoonatures often thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice, as it were, inyoocontrast to themselves, their unruliness, their ferocity—they thirst foryooit unconsciously. Passionate and fierce on the surface, they are painfullyyoocapable of loving woman, for instance, and with a spiritual and elevatedyoolove. Again do not laugh at me, this is very often the case in suchyoonatures. But they cannot hide their passions—sometimes very coarse—andyoothat is conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is unseen. Theiryoopassions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a noble and loftyyoocreature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new life, seeks toyoocorrect himself, to be better, to become noble and honorable, ‘sublime andyoobeautiful,’ however much the expression has been ridiculed.yooyoo“I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client’syooengagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard just now was notyooevidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and revengeful woman, and ityoowas not for her—oh, not for her!—to reproach him with treachery, for sheyoohas betrayed him! If she had had but a little time for reflection sheyoowould not have given such evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my clientyoois not a monster, as she called him!yooyoo“The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: ‘I am the GoodyooShepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, so that notyooone of them might be lost.’ Let not a man’s soul be lost through us!yooyoo“I asked just now what does ‘father’ mean, and exclaimed that it was ayoogreat word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly, gentlemen,yooand I venture to call things by their right names: such a father as oldyooKaramazov cannot be called a father and does not deserve to be. Filialyoolove for an unworthy father is an absurdity, an impossibility. Love cannotyoobe created from nothing: only God can create something from nothing.yooyoo“ ‘Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,’ the apostle writes, fromyooa heart glowing with love. It’s not for the sake of my client that I quoteyoothese sacred words, I mention them for all fathers. Who has authorized meyooto preach to fathers? No one. But as a man and a citizen I make myyooappeal—_vivos voco!_ We are not long on earth, we do many evil deeds andyoosay many evil words. So let us all catch a favorable moment when we areyooall together to say a good word to each other. That’s what I am doing:yoowhile I am in this place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not foryoonothing is this tribune given us by the highest authority—all Russia hearsyoous! I am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud toyooall fathers: ‘Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.’ Yes, let usyoofirst fulfill Christ’s injunction ourselves and only then venture toyooexpect it of our children. Otherwise we are not fathers, but enemies ofyooour children, and they are not our children, but our enemies, and we haveyoomade them our enemies ourselves. ‘What measure ye mete it shall beyoomeasured unto you again’—it’s not I who say that, it’s the Gospel precept,yoomeasure to others according as they measure to you. How can we blameyoochildren if they measure us according to our measure?yooyoo“Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having secretlyyoogiven birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of which no one knewyooanything was found in the corner of the loft, behind some bricks. It wasyooopened and inside was found the body of a new-born child which she hadyookilled. In the same box were found the skeletons of two other babiesyoowhich, according to her own confession, she had killed at the moment ofyootheir birth.yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She gave birthyooto them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would any one venture toyoogive her the sacred name of mother? Let us be bold, gentlemen, let us beyooaudacious even: it’s our duty to be so at this moment and not to be afraidyooof certain words and ideas like the Moscow women in Ostrovsky’s play, whoyooare scared at the sound of certain words. No, let us prove that theyooprogress of the last few years has touched even us, and let us sayyooplainly, the father is not merely he who begets the child, but he whoyoobegets it and does his duty by it.yooyoo“Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the otheryoointerpretation of the word ‘father,’ which insists that any father, evenyoothough he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his children, stillyooremains my father simply because he begot me. But this is, so to say, theyoomystical meaning which I cannot comprehend with my intellect, but can onlyyooaccept by faith, or, better to say, _on faith_, like many other thingsyoowhich I do not understand, but which religion bids me believe. But in thatyoocase let it be kept outside the sphere of actual life. In the sphere ofyooactual life, which has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon usyoogreat duties and obligations, in that sphere, if we want to beyoohumane—Christian, in fact—we must, or ought to, act only upon convictionsyoojustified by reason and experience, which have been passed through theyoocrucible of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as thoughyooin dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not ill-treatyooand ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian work, not only mystic, butyoorational and philanthropic....”yooyooThere was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the court,yoobut Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring them to let himyoofinish without interruption. The court relapsed into silence at once. Theyooorator went on.yooyoo“Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up and begin toyooreason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot, and we will not imposeyooon them an impossible restriction. The sight of an unworthy fatheryooinvoluntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature,yooespecially when he compares him with the excellent fathers of hisyoocompanions. The conventional answer to this question is: ‘He begot you,yooand you are his flesh and blood, and therefore you are bound to love him.’yooThe youth involuntarily reflects: ‘But did he love me when he begot me?’yoohe asks, wondering more and more. ‘Was it for my sake he begot me? He didyoonot know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion,yooperhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only transmitted to me a propensityyooto drunkenness—that’s all he’s done for me.... Why am I bound to love himyoosimply for begetting me when he has cared nothing for me all my lifeyooafter?’yooyoo“Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but do notyooexpect an impossible restraint from a young mind. ‘Drive nature out of theyoodoor and it will fly in at the window,’ and, above all, let us not beyooafraid of words, but decide the question according to the dictates ofyooreason and humanity and not of mystic ideas. How shall it be decided? Why,yoolike this. Let the son stand before his father and ask him, ‘Father, tellyoome, why must I love you? Father, show me that I must love you,’ and ifyoothat father is able to answer him and show him good reason, we have ayooreal, normal, parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but onyooa rational, responsible and strictly humanitarian basis. But if he doesyoonot, there’s an end to the family tie. He is not a father to him, and theyooson has a right to look upon him as a stranger, and even an enemy. Ouryootribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a school of true and soundyooideas.”yooyoo(Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost franticyooapplause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a good half of ityooapplauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded. Shrieks andyooexclamations were heard from the gallery, where the ladies were sitting.yooHandkerchiefs were waved. The President began ringing his bell with allyoohis might. He was obviously irritated by the behavior of the audience, butyoodid not venture to clear the court as he had threatened. Even persons ofyoohigh position, old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on speciallyyooreserved seats behind the judges, applauded the orator and waved theiryoohandkerchiefs. So that when the noise died down, the President confinedyoohimself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court, andyooFetyukovitch, excited and triumphant, continued his speech.)yooyoo“Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which so much hasyoobeen said to-day, when the son got over the fence and stood face to faceyoowith the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him. I insist mostyooemphatically it was not for money he ran to his father’s house: the chargeyooof robbery is an absurdity, as I proved before. And it was not to murderyoohim he broke into the house, oh, no! If he had had that design he would,yooat least, have taken the precaution of arming himself beforehand. Theyoobrass pestle he caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it.yooGranted that he deceived his father by tapping at the window, granted thatyoohe made his way in—I’ve said already that I do not for a moment believeyoothat legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment. Gentlemen,yooI swear to you by all that’s holy, if it had not been his father, but anyooordinary enemy, he would, after running through the rooms and satisfyingyoohimself that the woman was not there, have made off, post-haste, withoutyoodoing any harm to his rival. He would have struck him, pushed him awayyooperhaps, nothing more, for he had no thought and no time to spare foryoothat. What he wanted to know was where she was. But his father, hisyoofather! The mere sight of the father who had hated him from his childhood,yoohad been his enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, wasyooenough! A feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly,yooclouding his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse ofyoomadness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly andyoounconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging the violation of itsyooeternal laws.yooyoo“But the prisoner even then did not murder him—I maintain that, I cry thatyooaloud!—no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant disgust,yoonot meaning to kill him, not knowing that he would kill him. Had he notyoohad this fatal pestle in his hand, he would have only knocked his fatheryoodown perhaps, but would not have killed him. As he ran away, he did notyooknow whether he had killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder.yooSuch a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannotyoobe called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide byyooprejudice.yooyoo“But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did thisyoomurder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict andyoopunish him, he will say to himself: ‘These people have done nothing for myyoobringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to makeyoome better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eatyooand to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here theyyoohave sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, andyooowe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. Theyyooare cruel and I will be cruel.’ That is what he will say, gentlemen of theyoojury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will only make it easier foryoohim: you will ease his conscience, he will curse the blood he has shed andyoowill not regret it. At the same time you will destroy in him theyoopossibility of becoming a new man, for he will remain in his wickednessyooand blindness all his life.yooyoo“But do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most awfulyoopunishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to save him andyooregenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your mercy! You will see,yooyou will hear how he will tremble and be horror-struck. ‘How can I endureyoothis mercy? How can I endure so much love? Am I worthy of it?’ That’s whatyoohe will exclaim.yooyoo“Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart, gentlemen ofyoothe jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts for a great and lovingyooaction, it will melt and mount upwards. There are souls which, in theiryoolimitation, blame the whole world. But subdue such a soul with mercy, showyooit love, and it will curse its past, for there are many good impulses inyooit. Such a heart will expand and see that God is merciful and that men areyoogood and just. He will be horror-stricken; he will be crushed by remorseyooand the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth. And he will not sayyoothen, ‘I am quits,’ but will say, ‘I am guilty in the sight of all men andyooam more unworthy than all.’ With tears of penitence and poignant, tenderyooanguish, he will exclaim: ‘Others are better than I, they wanted to saveyoome, not to ruin me!’ Oh, this act of mercy is so easy for you, for in theyooabsence of anything like real evidence it will be too awful for you toyoopronounce: ‘Yes, he is guilty.’yooyoo“Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man! Do you hear,yoodo you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our gloriousyoohistory? It is not for an insignificant person like me to remind you thatyoothe Russian court does not exist for the punishment only, but also for theyoosalvation of the criminal! Let other nations think of retribution and theyooletter of the law, we will cling to the spirit and the meaning—theyoosalvation and the reformation of the lost. If this is true, if Russia andyooher justice are such, she may go forward with good cheer! Do not try toyooscare us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand asideyooin disgust. Not a runaway troika, but the stately chariot of Russia willyoomove calmly and majestically to its goal. In your hands is the fate of myyooclient, in your hands is the fate of Russian justice. You will defend it,yooyou will save it, you will prove that there are men to watch over it, thatyooit is in good hands!”yooyooyooyooChapter XIV. The Peasants Stand FirmyooyooyooThis was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the enthusiasm of theyooaudience burst like an irresistible storm. It was out of the question toyoostop it: the women wept, many of the men wept too, even two importantyoopersonages shed tears. The President submitted, and even postponed ringingyoohis bell. The suppression of such an enthusiasm would be the suppressionyooof something sacred, as the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himselfyoowas genuinely touched.yooyooAnd it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to make certainyooobjections. People looked at him with hatred. “What? What’s the meaning ofyooit? He positively dares to make objections,” the ladies babbled. But ifyoothe whole world of ladies, including his wife, had protested he could notyoohave been stopped at that moment. He was pale, he was shaking withyooemotion, his first phrases were even unintelligible, he gasped for breath,yoocould hardly speak clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recoveredyoohimself. Of this new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.yooyoo“... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But what is this defenseyooif not one romance on the top of another? All that was lacking was poetry.yooFyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his mistress, tears open the envelopeyooand throws it on the floor. We are even told what he said while engaged inyoothis strange act. Is not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have weyoothat he had taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-mindedyooidiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society foryoohis illegitimate birth—isn’t this a romance in the Byronic style? And theyooson who breaks into his father’s house and murders him without murderingyoohim is not even a romance—this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which heyoocannot solve himself. If he murdered him, he murdered him, and what’s theyoomeaning of his murdering him without having murdered him—who can make headyooor tail of this?yooyoo“Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and soundyooideas and from this tribune of ‘sound ideas’ is heard a solemn declarationyoothat to call the murder of a father ‘parricide’ is nothing but ayooprejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child is to askyoohis father why he is to love him, what will become of us? What will becomeyooof the foundations of society? What will become of the family? Parricide,yooit appears, is only a bogy of Moscow merchants’ wives. The most precious,yoothe most sacred guarantees for the destiny and future of Russian justiceyooare presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain anyooobject—to obtain the justification of something which cannot be justified.yoo‘Oh, crush him by mercy,’ cries the counsel for the defense; but that’syooall the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he isyoocrushed. And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking onlyyoofor the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honor ofyoothe parricide to commemorate his exploit among future generations?yooReligion and the Gospel are corrected—that’s all mysticism, we are told,yooand ours is the only true Christianity which has been subjected to theyooanalysis of reason and common sense. And so they set up before us a falseyoosemblance of Christ! ‘What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto youyooagain,’ cried the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces thatyooChrist teaches us to measure as it is measured to us—and this from theyootribune of truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eveyooof making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintanceyoowith what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of useyooto produce a certain effect—all to serve the purpose! But what Christyoocommands us is something very different: He bids us beware of doing this,yoobecause the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive and to turnyoothe other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors as they measure toyoous. This is what our God has taught us and not that to forbid children toyoomurder their fathers is a prejudice. And we will not from the tribune ofyootruth and good sense correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel foryoothe defense deigns to call only ‘the crucified lover of humanity,’ inyooopposition to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, ‘For Thou art ouryooGod!’ ”yooyooAt this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous speaker,yoobegging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds, and so on, asyoopresidents always do in such cases. The audience, too, was uneasy. Theyoopublic was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.yooFetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only mounted the tribune to layyoohis hand on his heart and, with an offended voice, utter a few words fullyooof dignity. He only touched again, lightly and ironically, on “romancing”yooand “psychology,” and in an appropriate place quoted, “Jupiter, you areyooangry, therefore you are wrong,” which provoked a burst of approvingyoolaughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means likeyooJupiter. Then, _à propos_ of the accusation that he was teaching the youngyoogeneration to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch observed, with greatyoodignity, that he would not even answer. As for the prosecutor’s charge ofyoouttering unorthodox opinions, Fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personalyooinsinuation and that he had expected in this court to be secure fromyooaccusations “damaging to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.”yooBut at these words the President pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitchyooconcluded his speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court.yooAnd Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, “crushed foryoogood.”yooyooThen the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said veryyoolittle. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally. The look ofyoostrength and independence with which he had entered in the morning hadyooalmost disappeared. He seemed as though he had passed through anyooexperience that day, which had taught him for the rest of his lifeyoosomething very important he had not understood till then. His voice wasyooweak, he did not shout as before. In his words there was a new note ofyoohumility, defeat and submission.yooyoo“What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment has comeyoofor me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end has come to an erring man!yooBut, before God, I repeat to you, I am innocent of my father’s blood! Foryoothe last time I repeat, it wasn’t I killed him! I was erring, but I lovedyoowhat is good. Every instant I strove to reform, but I lived like a wildyoobeast. I thank the prosecutor, he told me many things about myself that Iyoodid not know; but it’s not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor isyoomistaken. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him; but it’s notyootrue that I killed my father, and he needn’t have supposed it. And don’tyoobelieve the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my heart is heavy. If youyoospare me, if you let me go, I will pray for you. I will be a better man. Iyoogive you my word before God I will! And if you will condemn me, I’ll breakyoomy sword over my head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not robyoome of my God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemenyoo... spare me!”yooyooHe almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardlyyooarticulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the questionsyooand began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.yooyooBut I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire foryooconsultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge to theyoojury was rather feeble. “Be impartial, don’t be influenced by theyooeloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that thereyoois a great responsibility laid upon you,” and so on and so on.yooyooThe jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, moveyooabout, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at theyoobuffet. It was very late, almost one o’clock in the night, but nobody wentyooaway: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose. Allyoowaited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, foryoothe ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their heartsyoowere untroubled. An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They allyooprepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I mustyooown there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that anyooacquittal was inevitable. Some were pleased, others frowned, while someyoowere simply dejected, not wanting him to be acquitted. Fetyukovitchyoohimself was confident of his success. He was surrounded by peopleyoocongratulating him and fawning upon him.yooyoo“There are,” he said to one group, as I was told afterwards, “there areyooinvisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the jury. Oneyoofeels during one’s speech if they are being formed. I was aware of them.yooThey exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind at rest.”yooyoo“What will our peasants say now?” said one stout, cross-looking,yoopock-marked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching ayoogroup of gentlemen engaged in conversation.yooyoo“But they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks amongyoothem.”yooyoo“Yes, there are clerks,” said a member of the district council, joiningyoothe group.yooyoo“And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal, a juryman?”yooyoo“What of him?”yooyoo“He is a man with brains.”yooyoo“But he never speaks.”yooyoo“He is no great talker, but so much the better. There’s no need for theyooPetersburg man to teach him: he could teach all Petersburg himself. He’syoothe father of twelve children. Think of that!”yooyoo“Upon my word, you don’t suppose they won’t acquit him?” one of our youngyooofficials exclaimed in another group.yooyoo“They’ll acquit him for certain,” said a resolute voice.yooyoo“It would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him!” cried theyooofficial. “Suppose he did murder him—there are fathers and fathers! And,yoobesides, he was in such a frenzy.... He really may have done nothing butyooswing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old man down. But it was ayoopity they dragged the valet in. That was simply an absurd theory! If I’dyoobeen in Fetyukovitch’s place, I should simply have said straight out: ‘Heyoomurdered him; but he is not guilty, hang it all!’ ”yooyoo“That’s what he did, only without saying, ‘Hang it all!’ ”yooyoo“No, Mihail Semyonovitch, he almost said that, too,” put in a third voice.yooyoo“Why, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had cutyoothe throat of her lover’s lawful wife.”yooyoo“Oh, but she did not finish cutting it.”yooyoo“That makes no difference. She began cutting it.”yooyoo“What did you think of what he said about children? Splendid, wasn’t it?”yooyoo“Splendid!”yooyoo“And about mysticism, too!”yooyoo“Oh, drop mysticism, do!” cried some one else; “think of Ippolit and hisyoofate from this day forth. His wife will scratch his eyes out to-morrow foryooMitya’s sake.”yooyoo“Is she here?”yooyoo“What an idea! If she’d been here she’d have scratched them out in court.yooShe is at home with toothache. He he he!”yooyoo“He he he!”yooyooIn a third group:yooyoo“I dare say they will acquit Mitenka, after all.”yooyoo“I should not be surprised if he turns the ‘Metropolis’ upside downyooto-morrow. He will be drinking for ten days!”yooyoo“Oh, the devil!”yooyoo“The devil’s bound to have a hand in it. Where should he be if not here?”yooyoo“Well, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still it’s not the thing toyoobreak your father’s head with a pestle! Or what are we coming to?”yooyoo“The chariot! Do you remember the chariot?”yooyoo“Yes; he turned a cart into a chariot!”yooyoo“And to-morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit hisyoopurpose.”yooyoo“What cunning chaps there are nowadays! Is there any justice to be had inyooRussia?”yooyooBut the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour, neither moreyoonor less. A profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the publicyoohad taken their seats. I remember how the jurymen walked into the court.yooAt last! I won’t repeat the questions in order, and, indeed, I haveyooforgotten them. I remember only the answer to the President’s first andyoochief question: “Did the prisoner commit the murder for the sake ofyoorobbery and with premeditation?” (I don’t remember the exact words.) Thereyoowas a complete hush. The foreman of the jury, the youngest of the clerks,yoopronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the deathlike stillness of theyoocourt:yooyoo“Yes, guilty!”yooyooAnd the same answer was repeated to every question: “Yes, guilty!” andyoowithout the slightest extenuating comment. This no one had expected;yooalmost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least.yooThe deathlike silence in the court was not broken—all seemed petrified:yoothose who desired his conviction as well as those who had been eager foryoohis acquittal. But that was only for the first instant, and it wasyoofollowed by a fearful hubbub. Many of the men in the audience wereyoopleased. Some were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal theiryoojoy. Those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged theiryooshoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realize this. But howyooshall I describe the state the ladies were in? I thought they would createyooa riot. At first they could scarcely believe their ears. Then suddenly theyoowhole court rang with exclamations: “What’s the meaning of it? What next?”yooThey leapt up from their places. They seemed to fancy that it might be atyooonce reconsidered and reversed. At that instant Mitya suddenly stood upyooand cried in a heartrending voice, stretching his hands out before him:yooyoo“I swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment I am not guilty of myyoofather’s blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers, friends, have pity on theyooother woman!”yooyooHe could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that was heardyooall over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike his own. From theyoofarthest corner at the back of the gallery came a piercing shriek—it wasyooGrushenka. She had succeeded in begging admittance to the court againyoobefore the beginning of the lawyers’ speeches. Mitya was taken away. Theyoopassing of the sentence was deferred till next day. The whole court was inyooa hubbub but I did not wait to hear. I only remember a few exclamations Iyooheard on the steps as I went out.yooyoo“He’ll have a twenty years’ trip to the mines!”yooyoo“Not less.”yooyoo“Well, our peasants have stood firm.”yooyoo“And have done for our Mitya.”yooyooyooyooyooyooEPILOGUEyooyooyooyooyooChapter I. Plans For Mitya’s EscapeyooyooyooVery early, at nine o’clock in the morning, five days after the trial,yooAlyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna’s to talk over a matter of greatyooimportance to both of them, and to give her a message. She sat and talkedyooto him in the very room in which she had once received Grushenka. In theyoonext room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever. KaterinayooIvanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick andyoounconscious man to be carried to her house, disregarding the inevitableyoogossip and general disapproval of the public. One of the two relations whoyoolived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene inyoocourt, the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovnayoowould have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone on nursing theyoosick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky and Herzenstube wereyooattending him. The famous doctor had gone back to Moscow, refusing to giveyooan opinion as to the probable end of the illness. Though the doctorsyooencouraged Katerina Ivanovna and Alyosha, it was evident that they couldyoonot yet give them positive hopes of recovery.yooyooAlyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day. But this time he hadyoospecially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it would be toyooapproach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had another engagementyoothat could not be put off for that same morning, and there was need ofyoohaste.yooyooThey had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was paleyooand terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of hystericalyooexcitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha had come toyooher.yooyoo“Don’t worry about his decision,” she said, with confident emphasis toyooAlyosha. “One way or another he is bound to come to it. He must escape.yooThat unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle—not he, not DmitriyooFyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who hasyoosacrificed himself for his brother,” Katya added, with flashing eyes—“toldyoome the whole plan of escape long ago. You know he has already entered intoyoonegotiations.... I’ve told you something already.... You see, it willyooprobably come off at the third _étape_ from here, when the party ofyooprisoners is being taken to Siberia. Oh, it’s a long way off yet. IvanyooFyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the third _étape_.yooBut we don’t know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it’syooimpossible to find that out so long beforehand. To-morrow perhaps I willyooshow you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on theyooeve of the trial in case of need.... That was when—do you remember?—youyoofound us quarreling. He had just gone down-stairs, but seeing you I madeyoohim come back; do you remember? Do you know what we were quarreling aboutyoothen?”yooyoo“No, I don’t,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“Of course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He hadyootold me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about ityooat once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he toldyoome that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad withyoothat creature, I felt furious at once—I can’t tell you why, I don’t knowyoomyself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, andyoothat she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!” Katerina Ivanovna exclaimedyoosuddenly, her lips quivering with anger. “As soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch sawyoothat I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealousyooof Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrelyoobegan. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. Iyoocould not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still lovingyoothat ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not loveyooDmitri, that I loved no one but him! It was only resentment against thatyoocreature that made me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening youyoocame, he brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, ifyooanything happened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me that theyooenvelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he died or wasyootaken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone. Then he left me money,yoonearly ten thousand—those notes to which the prosecutor referred in hisyoospeech, having learnt from some one that he had sent them to be changed. Iyoowas tremendously impressed to find that Ivan Fyodorovitch had not given upyoohis idea of saving his brother, and was confiding this plan of escape toyoome, though he was still jealous of me and still convinced that I lovedyooMitya. Oh, that was a sacrifice! No, you cannot understand the greatnessyooof such self-sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I wanted to fall at his feetyooin reverence, but I thought at once that he would take it only for my joyyooat the thought of Mitya’s being saved (and he certainly would haveyooimagined that!), and I was so exasperated at the mere possibility of suchyooan unjust thought on his part that I lost my temper again, and instead ofyookissing his feet, flew into a fury again! Oh, I am unhappy! It’s myyoocharacter, my awful, unhappy character! Oh, you will see, I shall end byyoodriving him, too, to abandon me for another with whom he can get onyoobetter, like Dmitri. But ... no, I could not bear it, I should killyoomyself. And when you came in then, and when I called to you and told himyooto come back, I was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred heyooturned on me that—do you remember?—I cried out to you that it was he, heyooalone who had persuaded me that his brother Dmitri was a murderer! I saidyoothat malicious thing on purpose to wound him again. He had never, neveryoopersuaded me that his brother was a murderer. On the contrary, it was Iyoowho persuaded him! Oh, my vile temper was the cause of everything! I pavedyoothe way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that heyoowas an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would notyooruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am theyoocause of it all, I alone am to blame!”yooyooKatya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt thatyooshe was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudestyooheart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh,yooAlyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she hadyoocarefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but ityoowould have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been broughtyooso low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for heryoo“treachery” at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience wasyooimpelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and criesyooand hysterical writhings on the floor. But he dreaded that moment andyoolonged to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come even moreyoodifficult. He spoke of Mitya again.yooyoo“It’s all right, it’s all right, don’t be anxious about him!” she beganyooagain, sharply and stubbornly. “All that is only momentary, I know him, Iyooknow his heart only too well. You may be sure he will consent to escape.yooIt’s not as though it would be immediately; he will have time to make upyoohis mind to it. Ivan Fyodorovitch will be well by that time and willyoomanage it all himself, so that I shall have nothing to do with it. Don’tyoobe anxious; he will consent to run away. He has agreed already: do youyoosuppose he would give up that creature? And they won’t let her go to him,yooso he is bound to escape. It’s you he’s most afraid of, he is afraid youyoowon’t approve of his escape on moral grounds. But you must generouslyyoo_allow_ it, if your sanction is so necessary,” Katya added viciously. Sheyoopaused and smiled.yooyoo“He talks about some hymn,” she went on again, “some cross he has to bear,yoosome duty; I remember Ivan Fyodorovitch told me a great deal about it, andyooif you knew how he talked!” Katya cried suddenly, with feeling she couldyoonot repress, “if you knew how he loved that wretched man at the moment heyootold me, and how he hated him, perhaps, at the same moment. And I heardyoohis story and his tears with sneering disdain. Brute! Yes, I am a brute. Iyooam responsible for his fever. But that man in prison is incapable ofyoosuffering,” Katya concluded irritably. “Can such a man suffer? Men likeyoohim never suffer!”yooyooThere was a note of hatred and contemptuous repulsion in her words. Andyooyet it was she who had betrayed him. “Perhaps because she feels how she’syoowronged him she hates him at moments,” Alyosha thought to himself. Heyoohoped that it was only “at moments.” In Katya’s last words he detected ayoochallenging note, but he did not take it up.yooyoo“I sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him yourself.yooOr do you, too, consider that to escape would be dishonorable, cowardly,yooor something ... unchristian, perhaps?” Katya added, even more defiantly.yooyoo“Oh, no. I’ll tell him everything,” muttered Alyosha. “He asks you to comeyooand see him to-day,” he blurted out suddenly, looking her steadily in theyooface. She started, and drew back a little from him on the sofa.yooyoo“Me? Can that be?” she faltered, turning pale.yooyoo“It can and ought to be!” Alyosha began emphatically, growing moreyooanimated. “He needs you particularly just now. I would not have opened theyoosubject and worried you, if it were not necessary. He is ill, he is besideyoohimself, he keeps asking for you. It is not to be reconciled with you thatyoohe wants you, but only that you would go and show yourself at his door. Soyoomuch has happened to him since that day. He realizes that he has injuredyooyou beyond all reckoning. He does not ask your forgiveness—‘It’syooimpossible to forgive me,’ he says himself—but only that you would showyooyourself in his doorway.”yooyoo“It’s so sudden....” faltered Katya. “I’ve had a presentiment all theseyoodays that you would come with that message. I knew he would ask me toyoocome. It’s impossible!”yooyoo“Let it be impossible, but do it. Only think, he realizes for the firstyootime how he has wounded you, the first time in his life; he had neveryoograsped it before so fully. He said, ‘If she refuses to come I shall beyoounhappy all my life.’ Do you hear? though he is condemned to penalyooservitude for twenty years, he is still planning to be happy—is not thatyoopiteous? Think—you must visit him; though he is ruined, he is innocent,”yoobroke like a challenge from Alyosha. “His hands are clean, there is noyooblood on them! For the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visityoohim now. Go, greet him on his way into the darkness—stand at his door,yoothat is all.... You ought to do it, you ought to!” Alyosha concluded,yoolaying immense stress on the word “ought.”yooyoo“I ought to ... but I cannot....” Katya moaned. “He will look at me.... Iyoocan’t.”yooyoo“Your eyes ought to meet. How will you live all your life, if you don’tyoomake up your mind to do it now?”yooyoo“Better suffer all my life.”yooyoo“You ought to go, you ought to go,” Alyosha repeated with mercilessyooemphasis.yooyoo“But why to-day, why at once?... I can’t leave our patient—”yooyoo“You can for a moment. It will only be a moment. If you don’t come, heyoowill be in delirium by to-night. I would not tell you a lie; have pity onyoohim!”yooyoo“Have pity on _me!_” Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she burst intoyootears.yooyoo“Then you will come,” said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears. “I’ll go andyootell him you will come directly.”yooyoo“No, don’t tell him so on any account,” cried Katya in alarm. “I willyoocome, but don’t tell him beforehand, for perhaps I may go, but not goyooin.... I don’t know yet—”yooyooHer voice failed her. She gasped for breath. Alyosha got up to go.yooyoo“And what if I meet any one?” she said suddenly, in a low voice, turningyoowhite again.yooyoo“That’s just why you must go now, to avoid meeting any one. There will beyoono one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will expect you,” heyooconcluded emphatically, and went out of the room.yooyooyooyooyooChapter II. For A Moment The Lie Becomes TruthyooyooyooHe hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now. The day after hisyoofate was determined, Mitya had fallen ill with nervous fever, and was sentyooto the prison division of the town hospital. But at the request of severalyoopersons (Alyosha, Madame Hohlakov, Lise, etc.), Doctor Varvinsky had putyooMitya not with other prisoners, but in a separate little room, the oneyoowhere Smerdyakov had been. It is true that there was a sentinel at theyooother end of the corridor, and there was a grating over the window, soyoothat Varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he had shown, whichyoowas not quite legal, indeed; but he was a kind-hearted and compassionateyooyoung man. He knew how hard it would be for a man like Mitya to pass atyooonce so suddenly into the society of robbers and murderers, and that heyoomust get used to it by degrees. The visits of relations and friends wereyooinformally sanctioned by the doctor and overseer, and even by the policeyoocaptain. But only Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin hadyootried to force his way in twice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinskyyoonot to admit him.yooyooAlyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing-gown, ratheryoofeverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water, on his head. Heyoolooked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined expression, but thereyoowas a shade of something like dread discernible in it. He had becomeyooterribly preoccupied since the trial; sometimes he would be silent foryoohalf an hour together, and seemed to be pondering something heavily andyoopainfully, oblivious of everything about him. If he roused himself fromyoohis brooding and began to talk, he always spoke with a kind of abruptnessyooand never of what he really wanted to say. He looked sometimes with a faceyooof suffering at his brother. He seemed to be more at ease with Grushenkayoothan with Alyosha. It is true, he scarcely spoke to her at all, but asyoosoon as she came in, his whole face lighted up with joy.yooyooAlyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence. This time Mitya wasyoowaiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he did not dare ask him a question.yooHe felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would consent to come, and at theyoosame time he felt that if she did not come, something inconceivable wouldyoohappen. Alyosha understood his feelings.yooyoo“Trifon Borissovitch,” Mitya began nervously, “has pulled his whole inn toyoopieces, I am told. He’s taken up the flooring, pulled apart the planks,yoosplit up all the gallery, I am told. He is seeking treasure all theyootime—the fifteen hundred roubles which the prosecutor said I’d hiddenyoothere. He began playing these tricks, they say, as soon as he got home.yooServe him right, the swindler! The guard here told me yesterday; he comesyoofrom there.”yooyoo“Listen,” began Alyosha. “She will come, but I don’t know when. Perhapsyooto-day, perhaps in a few days, that I can’t tell. But she will come, sheyoowill, that’s certain.”yooyooMitya started, would have said something, but was silent. The news had ayootremendous effect on him. It was evident that he would have liked terriblyyooto know what had been said, but he was again afraid to ask. Somethingyoocruel and contemptuous from Katya would have cut him like a knife at thatyoomoment.yooyoo“This was what she said among other things; that I must be sure to setyooyour conscience at rest about escaping. If Ivan is not well by then sheyoowill see to it all herself.”yooyoo“You’ve spoken of that already,” Mitya observed musingly.yooyoo“And you have repeated it to Grusha,” observed Alyosha.yooyoo“Yes,” Mitya admitted. “She won’t come this morning.” He looked timidly atyoohis brother. “She won’t come till the evening. When I told her yesterdayyoothat Katya was taking measures, she was silent, but she set her mouth. Sheyooonly whispered, ‘Let her!’ She understood that it was important. I did notyoodare to try her further. She understands now, I think, that Katya noyoolonger cares for me, but loves Ivan.”yooyoo“Does she?” broke from Alyosha.yooyoo“Perhaps she does not. Only she is not coming this morning,” Mityayoohastened to explain again; “I asked her to do something for me. You know,yooIvan is superior to all of us. He ought to live, not us. He will recover.”yooyoo“Would you believe it, though Katya is alarmed about him, she scarcelyyoodoubts of his recovery,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“That means that she is convinced he will die. It’s because she isyoofrightened she’s so sure he will get well.”yooyoo“Ivan has a strong constitution, and I, too, believe there’s every hopeyoothat he will get well,” Alyosha observed anxiously.yooyoo“Yes, he will get well. But she is convinced that he will die. She has ayoogreat deal of sorrow to bear...” A silence followed. A grave anxiety wasyoofretting Mitya.yooyoo“Alyosha, I love Grusha terribly,” he said suddenly in a shaking voice,yoofull of tears.yooyoo“They won’t let her go out there to you,” Alyosha put in at once.yooyoo“And there is something else I wanted to tell you,” Mitya went on, with ayoosudden ring in his voice. “If they beat me on the way or out there, Iyoowon’t submit to it. I shall kill some one, and shall be shot for it. Andyoothis will be going on for twenty years! They speak to me rudely as it is.yooI’ve been lying here all night, passing judgment on myself. I am notyooready! I am not able to resign myself. I wanted to sing a ‘hymn’; but if ayooguard speaks rudely to me, I have not the strength to bear it. For GrushayooI would bear anything ... anything except blows.... But she won’t beyooallowed to come there.”yooyooAlyosha smiled gently.yooyoo“Listen, brother, once for all,” he said. “This is what I think about it.yooAnd you know that I would not tell you a lie. Listen: you are not ready,yooand such a cross is not for you. What’s more, you don’t need such ayoomartyr’s cross when you are not ready for it. If you had murdered ouryoofather, it would grieve me that you should reject your punishment. But youyooare innocent, and such a cross is too much for you. You wanted to makeyooyourself another man by suffering. I say, only remember that other manyooalways, all your life and wherever you go; and that will be enough foryooyou. Your refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel allyooyour life an even greater duty, and that constant feeling will do more toyoomake you a new man, perhaps, than if you went there. For there you wouldyoonot endure it and would repine, and perhaps at last would say: ‘I amyooquits.’ The lawyer was right about that. Such heavy burdens are not foryooall men. For some they are impossible. These are my thoughts about it, ifyooyou want them so much. If other men would have to answer for your escape,yooofficers or soldiers, then I would not have ‘allowed’ you,” smiledyooAlyosha. “But they declare—the superintendent of that _étape_ told Ivanyoohimself—that if it’s well managed there will be no great inquiry, and thatyoothey can get off easily. Of course, bribing is dishonest even in such ayoocase, but I can’t undertake to judge about it, because if Ivan and Katyayoocommissioned me to act for you, I know I should go and give bribes. I mustyootell you the truth. And so I can’t judge of your own action. But let meyooassure you that I shall never condemn you. And it would be a strange thingyooif I could judge you in this. Now I think I’ve gone into everything.”yooyoo“But I do condemn myself!” cried Mitya. “I shall escape, that was settledyooapart from you; could Mitya Karamazov do anything but run away? But Iyooshall condemn myself, and I will pray for my sin for ever. That’s how theyooJesuits talk, isn’t it? Just as we are doing?”yooyoo“Yes.” Alyosha smiled gently.yooyoo“I love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding anything,”yoocried Mitya, with a joyful laugh. “So I’ve caught my Alyosha beingyooJesuitical. I must kiss you for that. Now listen to the rest; I’ll openyoothe other side of my heart to you. This is what I planned and decided. IfyooI run away, even with money and a passport, and even to America, I shouldyoobe cheered up by the thought that I am not running away for pleasure, notyoofor happiness, but to another exile as bad, perhaps, as Siberia. It is asyoobad, Alyosha, it is! I hate that America, damn it, already. Even thoughyooGrusha will be with me. Just look at her; is she an American? She isyooRussian, Russian to the marrow of her bones; she will be homesick for theyoomother country, and I shall see every hour that she is suffering for myyoosake, that she has taken up that cross for me. And what harm has she done?yooAnd how shall I, too, put up with the rabble out there, though they may beyoobetter than I, every one of them? I hate that America already! And thoughyoothey may be wonderful at machinery, every one of them, damn them, they areyoonot of my soul. I love Russia, Alyosha, I love the Russian God, though Iyooam a scoundrel myself. I shall choke there!” he exclaimed, his eyesyoosuddenly flashing. His voice was trembling with tears. “So this is whatyooI’ve decided, Alyosha, listen,” he began again, mastering his emotion. “Asyoosoon as I arrive there with Grusha, we will set to work at once on theyooland, in solitude, somewhere very remote, with wild bears. There must beyoosome remote parts even there. I am told there are still Redskins there,yoosomewhere, on the edge of the horizon. So to the country of the _Last ofyoothe Mohicans_, and there we’ll tackle the grammar at once, Grusha and I.yooWork and grammar—that’s how we’ll spend three years. And by that time weyooshall speak English like any Englishman. And as soon as we’ve learntyooit—good-by to America! We’ll run here to Russia as American citizens.yooDon’t be uneasy—we would not come to this little town. We’d hideyoosomewhere, a long way off, in the north or in the south. I shall beyoochanged by that time, and she will, too, in America. The doctors shallyoomake me some sort of wart on my face—what’s the use of their being soyoomechanical!—or else I’ll put out one eye, let my beard grow a yard, and Iyooshall turn gray, fretting for Russia. I dare say they won’t recognize us.yooAnd if they do, let them send us to Siberia. I don’t care. It will showyooit’s our fate. We’ll work on the land here, too, somewhere in the wilds,yooand I’ll make up as an American all my life. But we shall die on our ownyoosoil. That’s my plan, and it shan’t be altered. Do you approve?”yooyoo“Yes,” said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya paused for ayoominute and said suddenly:yooyoo“And how they worked it up at the trial! Didn’t they work it up!”yooyoo“If they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,” saidyooAlyosha, with a sigh.yooyoo“Yes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it’s hard,” Mityayoomoaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute.yooyoo“Alyosha, put me out of my misery at once!” he exclaimed suddenly. “Tellyoome, is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did she say? How did she sayyooit?”yooyoo“She said she would come, but I don’t know whether she will come to-day.yooIt’s hard for her, you know,” Alyosha looked timidly at his brother.yooyoo“I should think it is hard for her! Alyosha, it will drive me out of myyoomind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She understands. My God, calm my heart:yoowhat is it I want? I want Katya! Do I understand what I want? It’s theyooheadstrong, evil Karamazov spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering. I am ayooscoundrel, that’s all one can say.”yooyoo“Here she is!” cried Alyosha.yooyooAt that instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment she stoodyoostill, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He leapt impulsively toyoohis feet, and a scared look came into his face. He turned pale, but ayootimid, pleading smile appeared on his lips at once, and with anyooirresistible impulse he held out both hands to Katya. Seeing it, she flewyooimpetuously to him. She seized him by the hands, and almost by force madeyoohim sit down on the bed. She sat down beside him, and still keeping hisyoohands pressed them violently. Several times they both strove to speak, butyoostopped short and again gazed speechless with a strange smile, their eyesyoofastened on one another. So passed two minutes.yooyoo“Have you forgiven me?” Mitya faltered at last, and at the same momentyooturning to Alyosha, his face working with joy, he cried, “Do you hear whatyooI am asking, do you hear?”yooyoo“That’s what I loved you for, that you are generous at heart!” broke fromyooKatya. “My forgiveness is no good to you, nor yours to me; whether youyooforgive me or not, you will always be a sore place in my heart, and I inyooyours—so it must be....” She stopped to take breath. “What have I comeyoofor?” she began again with nervous haste: “to embrace your feet, to pressyooyour hands like this, till it hurts—you remember how in Moscow I used toyoosqueeze them—to tell you again that you are my god, my joy, to tell youyoothat I love you madly,” she moaned in anguish, and suddenly pressed hisyoohand greedily to her lips. Tears streamed from her eyes. Alyosha stoodyoospeechless and confounded; he had never expected what he was seeing.yooyoo“Love is over, Mitya!” Katya began again, “but the past is painfully dearyooto me. Know that you will always be so. But now let what might have beenyoocome true for one minute,” she faltered, with a drawn smile, looking intoyoohis face joyfully again. “You love another woman, and I love another man,yooand yet I shall love you for ever, and you will love me; do you know that?yooDo you hear? Love me, love me all your life!” she cried, with a quiveryooalmost of menace in her voice.yooyoo“I shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,” Mitya began, drawing ayoodeep breath at each word, “do you know, five days ago, that same evening,yooI loved you.... When you fell down and were carried out ... All my life!yooSo it will be, so it will always be—”yooyooSo they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless, perhapsyoonot even true, but at that moment it was all true, and they both believedyoowhat they said implicitly.yooyoo“Katya,” cried Mitya suddenly, “do you believe I murdered him? I know youyoodon’t believe it now, but then ... when you gave evidence.... Surely,yoosurely you did not believe it!”yooyoo“I did not believe it even then. I’ve never believed it. I hated you, andyoofor a moment I persuaded myself. While I was giving evidence I persuadedyoomyself and believed it, but when I’d finished speaking I left offyoobelieving it at once. Don’t doubt that! I have forgotten that I came hereyooto punish myself,” she said, with a new expression in her voice, quiteyoounlike the loving tones of a moment before.yooyoo“Woman, yours is a heavy burden,” broke, as it were, involuntarily fromyooMitya.yooyoo“Let me go,” she whispered. “I’ll come again. It’s more than I can bearyoonow.”yooyooShe was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud scream andyoostaggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room.yooNo one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly to the door, but when sheyooreached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly, turned as white as chalk andyoomoaned softly, almost in a whisper:yooyoo“Forgive me!”yooyooGrushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive,yoovenomous voice, answered:yooyoo“We are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of hatred! Asyoothough we could forgive one another! Save him, and I’ll worship you all myyoolife.”yooyoo“You won’t forgive her!” cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.yooyoo“Don’t be anxious, I’ll save him for you!” Katya whispered rapidly, andyooshe ran out of the room.yooyoo“And you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgivenessyooherself?” Mitya exclaimed bitterly again.yooyoo“Mitya, don’t dare to blame her; you have no right to!” Alyosha criedyoohotly.yooyoo“Her proud lips spoke, not her heart,” Grushenka brought out in a tone ofyoodisgust. “If she saves you I’ll forgive her everything—”yooyooShe stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She could not yetyoorecover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards, accidentally,yoowith no suspicion of what she would meet.yooyoo“Alyosha, run after her!” Mitya cried to his brother; “tell her ... Iyoodon’t know ... don’t let her go away like this!”yooyoo“I’ll come to you again at nightfall,” said Alyosha, and he ran afteryooKatya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She was walking fast,yoobut as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly:yooyoo“No, before that woman I can’t punish myself! I asked her forgivenessyoobecause I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgiveyoome.... I like her for that!” she added, in an unnatural voice, and heryooeyes flashed with fierce resentment.yooyoo“My brother did not expect this in the least,” muttered Alyosha. “He wasyoosure she would not come—”yooyoo“No doubt. Let us leave that,” she snapped. “Listen: I can’t go with youyooto the funeral now. I’ve sent them flowers. I think they still have money.yooIf necessary, tell them I’ll never abandon them.... Now leave me, leaveyoome, please. You are late as it is—the bells are ringing for theyooservice.... Leave me, please!”yooyooyooyooyooChapter III. Ilusha’s Funeral. The Speech At The StoneyooyooyooHe really was late. They had waited for him and had already decided toyoobear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the church without him. Ityoowas the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya wasyoosentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of theyooboys, Ilusha’s schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting himyooand were glad that he had come at last. There were about twelve of them,yoothey all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. “Fatheryoowill cry, be with father,” Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and theyooboys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them.yooyoo“How glad I am you’ve come, Karamazov!” he cried, holding out his hand toyooAlyosha. “It’s awful here. It’s really horrible to see it. Snegiryov isyoonot drunk, we know for a fact he’s had nothing to drink to-day, but heyooseems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly, but this is awful.yooKaramazov, if I am not keeping you, one question before you go in?”yooyoo“What is it, Kolya?” said Alyosha.yooyoo“Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your father or wasyooit the valet? As you say, so it will be. I haven’t slept for the last fouryoonights for thinking of it.”yooyoo“The valet killed him, my brother is innocent,” answered Alyosha.yooyoo“That’s what I said,” cried Smurov.yooyoo“So he will perish an innocent victim!” exclaimed Kolya; “though he isyooruined he is happy! I could envy him!”yooyoo“What do you mean? How can you? Why?” cried Alyosha surprised.yooyoo“Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!” said Kolyayoowith enthusiasm.yooyoo“But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such horror!” saidyooAlyosha.yooyoo“Of course ... I should like to die for all humanity, and as for disgrace,yooI don’t care about that—our names may perish. I respect your brother!”yooyoo“And so do I!” the boy, who had once declared that he knew who had foundedyooTroy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed up to his ears likeyooa peony as he had done on that occasion.yooyooAlyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded and his eyesyooclosed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His thin face wasyoohardly changed at all, and strange to say there was no smell of decay fromyoothe corpse. The expression of his face was serious and, as it were,yoothoughtful. His hands, crossed over his breast, looked particularlyyoobeautiful, as though chiseled in marble. There were flowers in his handsyooand the coffin, inside and out, was decked with flowers, which had beenyoosent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov. But there were flowers tooyoofrom Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha opened the door, the captain hadyooa bunch in his trembling hands and was strewing them again over his dearyooboy. He scarcely glanced at Alyosha when he came in, and he would not lookyooat any one, even at his crazy weeping wife, “mamma,” who kept trying toyoostand on her crippled legs to get a nearer look at her dead boy. Nina hadyoobeen pushed in her chair by the boys close up to the coffin. She sat withyooher head pressed to it and she too was no doubt quietly weeping.yooSnegiryov’s face looked eager, yet bewildered and exasperated. There wasyoosomething crazy about his gestures and the words that broke from him. “Oldyooman, dear old man!” he exclaimed every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It wasyoohis habit to call Ilusha “old man,” as a term of affection when he wasyooalive.yooyoo“Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his hand andyoogive it me,” the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either because theyoolittle white rose in Ilusha’s hand had caught her fancy or that she wantedyooone from his hand to keep in memory of him, she moved restlessly,yoostretching out her hands for the flower.yooyoo“I won’t give it to any one, I won’t give you anything,” Snegiryov criedyoocallously. “They are his flowers, not yours! Everything is his, nothing isyooyours!”yooyoo“Father, give mother a flower!” said Nina, lifting her face wet withyootears.yooyoo“I won’t give away anything and to her less than any one! She didn’t loveyooIlusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it to her,” theyoocaptain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how Ilusha had given up hisyoocannon to his mother. The poor, crazy creature was bathed in noiselessyootears, hiding her face in her hands.yooyooThe boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and that ityoowas time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle and began toyoolift it up.yooyoo“I don’t want him to be buried in the churchyard,” Snegiryov wailedyoosuddenly; “I’ll bury him by the stone, by our stone! Ilusha told me to. Iyoowon’t let him be carried out!”yooyooHe had been saying for the last three days that he would bury him by theyoostone, but Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her sister and all the boysyoointerfered.yooyoo“What an idea, bury him by an unholy stone, as though he had hangedyoohimself!” the old landlady said sternly. “There in the churchyard theyooground has been crossed. He’ll be prayed for there. One can hear theyoosinging in church and the deacon reads so plainly and verbally that ityoowill reach him every time just as though it were read over his grave.”yooyooAt last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say, “Take himyoowhere you will.” The boys raised the coffin, but as they passed theyoomother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that she might sayyoogood-by to Ilusha. But on seeing that precious little face, which for theyoolast three days she had only looked at from a distance, she trembled allyooover and her gray head began twitching spasmodically over the coffin.yooyoo“Mother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your blessing, kissyoohim,” Nina cried to her. But her head still twitched like an automaton andyoowith a face contorted with bitter grief she began, without a word, beatingyooher breast with her fist. They carried the coffin past her. Nina pressedyooher lips to her brother’s for the last time as they bore the coffin byyooher. As Alyosha went out of the house he begged the landlady to look afteryoothose who were left behind, but she interrupted him before he hadyoofinished.yooyoo“To be sure, I’ll stay with them, we are Christians, too.” The old womanyoowept as she said it.yooyooThey had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more than threeyoohundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight frost. The churchyoobells were still ringing. Snegiryov ran fussing and distracted after theyoocoffin, in his short old summer overcoat, with his head bare and his soft,yooold, wide-brimmed hat in his hand. He seemed in a state of bewilderedyooanxiety. At one minute he stretched out his hand to support the head ofyoothe coffin and only hindered the bearers, at another he ran alongside andyootried to find a place for himself there. A flower fell on the snow and heyoorushed to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on theyooloss of that flower.yooyoo“And the crust of bread, we’ve forgotten the crust!” he cried suddenly inyoodismay. But the boys reminded him at once that he had taken the crust ofyoobread already and that it was in his pocket. He instantly pulled it outyooand was reassured.yooyoo“Ilusha told me to, Ilusha,” he explained at once to Alyosha. “I wasyoositting by him one night and he suddenly told me: ‘Father, when my graveyoois filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the sparrows may flyyoodown, I shall hear and it will cheer me up not to be lying alone.’ ”yooyoo“That’s a good thing,” said Alyosha, “we must often take some.”yooyoo“Every day, every day!” said the captain quickly, seeming cheered at theyoothought.yooyooThey reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle of it.yooThe boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so, all throughyoothe service. It was an old and rather poor church; many of the ikons wereyoowithout settings; but such churches are the best for praying in. Duringyoothe mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he hadyoooutbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. Atyooone moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or theyoowreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace ityooand was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stoodyooquietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity.yooAfter the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standingyoobeside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did notyooexplain what he meant. During the prayer, “Like the Cherubim,” he joinedyooin the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, heyoopressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while.yooyooAt last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. Theyoodistracted father began fussing about again, but the touching andyooimpressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He seemed suddenlyyooto shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he tried atyoofirst to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When they began takingyooleave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung his arms about, asyoothough he would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily andyoopersistently kissing his dead boy on the lips. At last they succeeded inyoopersuading him to come away from the step, but suddenly he impulsivelyyoostretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin. Heyoolooked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that heyooapparently forgot his grief for a minute. Gradually he seemed to sink intoyoobrooding and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried toyoothe grave. It was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the church,yooKaterina Ivanovna had paid for it. After the customary rites theyoograve-diggers lowered the coffin. Snegiryov with his flowers in his handsyoobent down so low over the open grave that the boys caught hold of his coatyooin alarm and pulled him back. He did not seem to understand fully what wasyoohappening. When they began filling up the grave, he suddenly pointedyooanxiously at the falling earth and began trying to say something, but noyooone could make out what he meant, and he stopped suddenly. Then he wasyooreminded that he must crumble the bread and he was awfully excited,yoosnatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces and flinging theyoomorsels on the grave.yooyoo“Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!” he muttered anxiously.yooyooOne of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble the breadyoowith the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give them to someyooone to hold for a time. But he would not do this and seemed indeedyoosuddenly alarmed for his flowers, as though they wanted to take them fromyoohim altogether. And after looking at the grave, and as it were, satisfyingyoohimself that everything had been done and the bread had been crumbled, heyoosuddenly, to the surprise of every one, turned, quite composedly even, andyoomade his way homewards. But his steps became more and more hurried, heyooalmost ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with him.yooyoo“The flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I was unkind toyoomamma,” he began exclaiming suddenly.yooyooSome one called to him to put on his hat as it was cold. But he flung theyoohat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating, “I won’t haveyoothe hat, I won’t have the hat.” Smurov picked it up and carried it afteryoohim. All the boys were crying, and Kolya and the boy who discovered aboutyooTroy most of all. Though Smurov, with the captain’s hat in his hand, wasyoocrying bitterly too, he managed, as he ran, to snatch up a piece of redyoobrick that lay on the snow of the path, to fling it at the flock ofyoosparrows that was flying by. He missed them, of course, and went on cryingyooas he ran. Half-way, Snegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for half ayoominute, as though struck by something, and suddenly turning back to theyoochurch, ran towards the deserted grave. But the boys instantly overtookyoohim and caught hold of him on all sides. Then he fell helpless on the snowyooas though he had been knocked down, and struggling, sobbing, and wailing,yoohe began crying out, “Ilusha, old man, dear old man!” Alyosha and Kolyayootried to make him get up, soothing and persuading him.yooyoo“Captain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude,” muttered Kolya.yooyoo“You’ll spoil the flowers,” said Alyosha, “and mamma is expecting them,yooshe is sitting crying because you would not give her any before. Ilusha’syoolittle bed is still there—”yooyoo“Yes, yes, mamma!” Snegiryov suddenly recollected, “they’ll take away theyoobed, they’ll take it away,” he added as though alarmed that they reallyyoowould. He jumped up and ran homewards again. But it was not far off andyoothey all arrived together. Snegiryov opened the door hurriedly and calledyooto his wife with whom he had so cruelly quarreled just before:yooyoo“Mamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these flowers,” heyoocried, holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been frozenyooand broken while he was struggling in the snow. But at that instant he sawyooin the corner, by the little bed, Ilusha’s little boots, which theyoolandlady had put tidily side by side. Seeing the old, patched,yoorusty-looking, stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed to them, fellyooon his knees, snatched up one boot and, pressing his lips to it, beganyookissing it greedily, crying, “Ilusha, old man, dear old man, where areyooyour little feet?”yooyoo“Where have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?” the lunaticyoocried in a heartrending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs. Kolya ran outyooof the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha too went out.yooyoo“Let them weep,” he said to Kolya, “it’s no use trying to comfort themyoojust now. Let us wait a minute and then go back.”yooyoo“No, it’s no use, it’s awful,” Kolya assented. “Do you know, Karamazov,”yoohe dropped his voice so that no one could hear them, “I feel dreadfullyyoosad, and if it were only possible to bring him back, I’d give anything inyoothe world to do it.”yooyoo“Ah, so would I,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here to-night?yooHe’ll be drunk, you know.”yooyoo“Perhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be enough, toyoospend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we all come togetheryoowe shall remind them of everything again,” Alyosha suggested.yooyoo“The landlady is laying the table for them now—there’ll be a funeralyoodinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back to it,yooKaramazov?”yooyoo“Of course,” said Alyosha.yooyoo“It’s all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes after it,yooit all seems so unnatural in our religion.”yooyoo“They are going to have salmon, too,” the boy who had discovered aboutyooTroy observed in a loud voice.yooyoo“I beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again with youryooidiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to you and doesn’tyoocare to know whether you exist or not!” Kolya snapped out irritably. Theyooboy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply.yooyooMeantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurovyooexclaimed:yooyoo“There’s Ilusha’s stone, under which they wanted to bury him.”yooyooThey all stood still by the big stone. Alyosha looked and the wholeyoopicture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day, how Ilusha,yooweeping and hugging his father, had cried, “Father, father, how heyooinsulted you,” rose at once before his imagination.yooyooA sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul. With a serious and earnestyooexpression he looked from one to another of the bright, pleasant faces ofyooIlusha’s schoolfellows, and suddenly said to them:yooyoo“Boys, I should like to say one word to you, here at this place.”yooyooThe boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant eyesyooupon him.yooyoo“Boys, we shall soon part. I shall be for some time with my two brothers,yooof whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at death’s door.yooBut soon I shall leave this town, perhaps for a long time, so we shallyoopart. Let us make a compact here, at Ilusha’s stone, that we will neveryooforget Ilusha and one another. And whatever happens to us later in life,yooif we don’t meet for twenty years afterwards, let us always remember howyoowe buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones, do you remember, byyoothe bridge? and afterwards we all grew so fond of him. He was a fine boy,yooa kind-hearted, brave boy, he felt for his father’s honor and resented theyoocruel insult to him and stood up for him. And so in the first place, weyoowill remember him, boys, all our lives. And even if we are occupied withyoomost important things, if we attain to honor or fall into greatyoomisfortune—still let us remember how good it was once here, when we wereyooall together, united by a good and kind feeling which made us, for theyootime we were loving that poor boy, better perhaps than we are. My littleyoodoves—let me call you so, for you are very like them, those pretty blueyoobirds, at this minute as I look at your good dear faces. My dear children,yooperhaps you won’t understand what I am saying to you, because I oftenyoospeak very unintelligibly, but you’ll remember it all the same and willyooagree with my words some time. You must know that there is nothing higheryooand stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than someyoogood memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk to youyooa great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preservedyoofrom childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many suchyoomemories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if oneyoohas only one good memory left in one’s heart, even that may sometime beyoothe means of saving us. Perhaps we may even grow wicked later on, may beyoounable to refrain from a bad action, may laugh at men’s tears and at thoseyoopeople who say as Kolya did just now, ‘I want to suffer for all men,’ andyoomay even jeer spitefully at such people. But however bad we mayyoobecome—which God forbid—yet, when we recall how we buried Ilusha, how weyooloved him in his last days, and how we have been talking like friends allyootogether, at this stone, the cruelest and most mocking of us—if we doyoobecome so—will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good atyoothis moment! What’s more, perhaps, that one memory may keep him from greatyooevil and he will reflect and say, ‘Yes, I was good and brave and honestyoothen!’ Let him laugh to himself, that’s no matter, a man often laughs atyoowhat’s good and kind. That’s only from thoughtlessness. But I assure you,yooboys, that as he laughs he will say at once in his heart, ‘No, I do wrongyooto laugh, for that’s not a thing to laugh at.’ ”yooyoo“That will be so, I understand you, Karamazov!” cried Kolya, with flashingyooeyes.yooyooThe boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something, but theyyoorestrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion at the speaker.yooyoo“I say this in case we become bad,” Alyosha went on, “but there’s noyooreason why we should become bad, is there, boys? Let us be, first andyooabove all, kind, then honest and then let us never forget each other! Iyoosay that again. I give you my word for my part that I’ll never forget oneyooof you. Every face looking at me now I shall remember even for thirtyyooyears. Just now Kolya said to Kartashov that we did not care to knowyoowhether he exists or not. But I cannot forget that Kartashov exists andyoothat he is not blushing now as he did when he discovered the founders ofyooTroy, but is looking at me with his jolly, kind, dear little eyes. Boys,yoomy dear boys, let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha, clever, braveyooand generous like Kolya (though he will be ever so much cleverer when heyoois grown up), and let us all be as modest, as clever and sweet asyooKartashov. But why am I talking about those two? You are all dear to me,yooboys, from this day forth, I have a place in my heart for you all, and Iyoobeg you to keep a place in your hearts for me! Well, and who has united usyooin this kind, good feeling which we shall remember and intend to rememberyooall our lives? Who, if not Ilusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious toyoous for ever! Let us never forget him. May his memory live for ever in ouryoohearts from this time forth!”yooyoo“Yes, yes, for ever, for ever!” the boys cried in their ringing voices,yoowith softened faces.yooyoo“Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little boots, hisyoocoffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he stood up for himyooalone against the whole school.”yooyoo“We will remember, we will remember,” cried the boys. “He was brave, heyoowas good!”yooyoo“Ah, how I loved him!” exclaimed Kolya.yooyoo“Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don’t be afraid of life! How good life isyoowhen one does something good and just!”yooyoo“Yes, yes,” the boys repeated enthusiastically.yooyoo“Karamazov, we love you!” a voice, probably Kartashov’s, criedyooimpulsively.yooyoo“We love you, we love you!” they all caught it up. There were tears in theyooeyes of many of them.yooyoo“Hurrah for Karamazov!” Kolya shouted ecstatically.yooyoo“And may the dead boy’s memory live for ever!” Alyosha added again withyoofeeling.yooyoo“For ever!” the boys chimed in again.yooyoo“Karamazov,” cried Kolya, “can it be true what’s taught us in religion,yoothat we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see eachyooother again, all, Ilusha too?”yooyoo“Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other andyooshall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened!”yooAlyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.yooyoo“Ah, how splendid it will be!” broke from Kolya.yooyoo“Well, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner. Don’t beyooput out at our eating pancakes—it’s a very old custom and there’syoosomething nice in that!” laughed Alyosha. “Well, let us go! And now we goyoohand in hand.”yooyoo“And always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for Karamazov!” Kolyayoocried once more rapturously, and once more the boys took up hisyooexclamation: “Hurrah for Karamazov!”yooyooTHE ENDyooyooyooyooyooyooyooFOOTNOTESyooyooyoo    1 In Russian, “silen.”yooyoo    2 A proverbial expression in Russia.yooyoo    3 Grushenka.yooyoo    4 i.e. setter dog.yooyoo    5 Probably the public event was the Decabrist plot against the Tsar,yoo      of December 1825, in which the most distinguished men in Russia wereyoo      concerned.—TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.yooyoo    6 When a monk’s body is carried out from the cell to the church andyoo      from the church to the graveyard, the canticle “What earthly joy...”yoo      is sung.

His parents were very hard-workingyooand deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their fiveyoochildren in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their eveningsyooin reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a seriousyoocharacter.yooyooThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in theyoofinal examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he hadyooalready begun his first work, "Poor Folk."yooyooThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review andyoowas received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himselfyooinstantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful careeryooseemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 heyoowas arrested.yooyooThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevskyyoowas one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourieryooand Proudhon. He was accused of "taking part in conversations againstyoothe censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and ofyooknowing of the intention to set up a printing press." Under NicholasyooI. (that "stern and just man," as Maurice Baring calls him) this wasyooenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months' imprisonmentyoohe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square toyoobe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: "They snappedyoowords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn byyoopersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,yooto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had onlyyooa few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones andyooI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and toyoobid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,yoobrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had sparedyoous our lives." The sentence was commuted to hard labour.yooyooOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, andyoonever regained his sanity.yooyooThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp onyooDostoevsky's mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end toyooaccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessingyooin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.yooHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on theyoocruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penalyooservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, whereyoohe began the "Dead House," and some years of service in a disciplinaryyoobattalion.yooyooHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrestyooand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which heyoosuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four timesyooa year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he wasyooallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--"Vremya," which wasyooforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lostyoohis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yetyoohe took upon himself the payment of his brother's debts. He startedyooanother journal--"The Epoch," which within a few months was alsoyooprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother's family wasyoodependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and isyoosaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life wereyoomuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.yooyooIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of theyoomonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinaryyoodemonstrations of love and honour.yooyooA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by ayoovast multitude of mourners, who "gave the hapless man the funeral of ayooking." He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.yooyooIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feelingyooinspired by Dostoevsky: "He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood andyooour bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply thanyoowe have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heartyoowhich we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his otheryoogifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it heyoobecame great."yooyooyooyooyooyooCRIME AND PUNISHMENTyooyooyooyooyooPART IyooyooyooyooCHAPTER IyooyooOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out ofyoothe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as thoughyooin hesitation, towards K. bridge.yooyooHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. Hisyoogarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was moreyoolike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,yoodinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every timeyoohe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of whichyooinvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had ayoosick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He wasyoohopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.yooyooThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; butyoofor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,yooverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed inyoohimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, notyooonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but theyooanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He hadyoogiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost allyoodesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terroryoofor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to heryootrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threatsyooand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, toyoolie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat andyooslip out unseen.yooyooThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutelyyooaware of his fears.yooyoo"I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by theseyootrifles," he thought, with an odd smile. "Hm... yes, all is in a man'syoohands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom. It wouldyoobe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a newyoostep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talkingyootoo much. It's because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it isyoothat I chatter because I do nothing. I've learned to chatter thisyoolast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack theyooGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Isyoo_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It's simply a fantasy to amuseyoomyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything."yooyooThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustleyooand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and thatyoospecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get outyooof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man's alreadyyoooverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, whichyooare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken menyoowhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completedyoothe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundestyoodisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man's refined face. He was,yooby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,yoowell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sankyoointo deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blanknessyooof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caringyooto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from theyoohabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At theseyoomoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in ayootangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tastedyoofood.yooyooHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness wouldyoohave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarteryooof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would haveyoocreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the numberyooof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the tradingyooand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in theyooheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streetsyoothat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there wasyoosuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart, that,yooin spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags leastyooof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met withyooacquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he dislikedyoomeeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknownyooreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavyyoodray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: "Hey there, Germanyoohatter" bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the youngyooman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tallyooround hat from Zimmerman's, but completely worn out, rusty with age, allyootorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemlyyoofashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terroryoohad overtaken him.yooyoo"I knew it," he muttered in confusion, "I thought so! That's the worstyooof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail mightyoospoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurdyooand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, anyyoosort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears suchyooa hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... Whatyoomatters is that people would remember it, and that would give themyooa clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous asyoopossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it's just suchyootrifles that always ruin everything...."yooyooHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gateyooof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had countedyoothem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put noyoofaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideousyoobut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look uponyoothem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered atyoohis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regardyoothis "hideous" dream as an exploit to be attempted, although heyoostill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for ayoo"rehearsal" of his project, and at every step his excitement grew moreyooand more violent.yooyooWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge houseyoowhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into theyoostreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited byyooworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans ofyoosorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.yooThere was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in theyootwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed onyoothe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, andyooat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up theyoostaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiaryoowith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:yooin such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.yooyoo"If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass thatyooI were really going to do it?" he could not help asking himself as heyooreached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some portersyoowho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that theyooflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and hisyoofamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on thisyoostaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. "That's a goodyoothing anyway," he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the oldyoowoman's flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made ofyootin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bellsyoothat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and nowyooits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring ityooclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrainedyooby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the oldyoowoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, andyoonothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.yooBut, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, andyooopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, whichyoowas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facingyoohim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,yoowithered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharpyoolittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smearedyoowith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,yoowhich looked like a hen's leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,yooand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangyyoofur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at everyyooinstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiaryooexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.yooyoo"Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago," the young man madeyoohaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be moreyoopolite.yooyoo"I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here," theyooold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.yooyoo"And here... I am again on the same errand," Raskolnikov continued, ayoolittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman's mistrust. "Perhapsyooshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the otheryootime," he thought with an uneasy feeling.yooyooThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,yooand pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor passyooin front of her:yooyoo"Step in, my good sir."yooyooThe little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper onyoothe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightlyyoolighted up at that moment by the setting sun.yooyoo"So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!" flashed as it were byyoochance through Raskolnikov's mind, and with a rapid glance he scannedyooeverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice andyooremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. Theyoofurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa withyooa huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, ayoodressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,yoochairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellowyooframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that wasyooall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everythingyoowas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;yooeverything shone.yooyoo"Lizaveta's work," thought the young man. There was not a speck of dustyooto be seen in the whole flat.yooyoo"It's in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds suchyoocleanliness," Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glanceyooat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, inyoowhich stood the old woman's bed and chest of drawers and into which heyoohad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.yooyoo"What do you want?" the old woman said severely, coming into the roomyooand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight inyoothe face.yooyoo"I've brought something to pawn here," and he drew out of his pocketyooan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved ayooglobe; the chain was of steel.yooyoo"But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the dayyoobefore yesterday."yooyoo"I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little."yooyoo"But that's for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sellyooyour pledge at once."yooyoo"How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?"yooyoo"You come with such trifles, my good sir, it's scarcely worth anything.yooI gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy ityooquite new at a jeweler's for a rouble and a half."yooyoo"Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father's. Iyooshall be getting some money soon."yooyoo"A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!"yooyoo"A rouble and a half!" cried the young man.yooyoo"Please yourself"--and the old woman handed him back the watch. Theyooyoung man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of goingyooaway; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhereyooelse he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.yooyoo"Hand it over," he said roughly.yooyooThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behindyoothe curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone inyoothe middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hearyooher unlocking the chest of drawers.yooyoo"It must be the top drawer," he reflected. "So she carries the keys inyooa pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there'syooone key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;yoothat can't be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be someyooother chest or strong-box... that's worth knowing. Strong-boxes alwaysyoohave keys like that... but how degrading it all is."yooyooThe old woman came back.yooyoo"Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must takeyoofifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. Butyoofor the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecksyooon the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecksyooaltogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for theyoowatch. Here it is."yooyoo"What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!"yooyoo"Just so."yooyooThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at theyooold woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was stillyoosomething he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite knowyoowhat.yooyoo"I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, AlyonayooIvanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get ityooback from a friend..." he broke off in confusion.yooyoo"Well, we will talk about it then, sir."yooyoo"Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here withyooyou?" He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into theyoopassage.yooyoo"What business is she of yours, my good sir?"yooyoo"Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,yooAlyona Ivanovna."yooyooRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became moreyooand more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, twoyooor three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he wasyooin the street he cried out, "Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! andyoocan I, can I possibly.... No, it's nonsense, it's rubbish!" he addedyooresolutely. "And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?yooWhat filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,yoodisgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I've been...."yooBut no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feelingyooof intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heartyoowhile he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such ayoopitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what toyoodo with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along theyoopavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostlingyooagainst them, and only came to his senses when he was in the nextyoostreet. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavernyoowhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.yooAt that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing andyoosupporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping toyoothink, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he hadyoonever been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by ayooburning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed hisyoosudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky littleyootable in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drankyoooff the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts becameyooclear.yooyoo"All that's nonsense," he said hopefully, "and there is nothing in ityooall to worry about! It's simply physical derangement. Just a glass ofyoobeer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,yoothe mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it allyoois!"yooyooBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerfulyooas though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazedyooround in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at thatyoomoment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was alsoyoonot normal.yooyooThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunkenyoomen he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men andyooa girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departureyooleft the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavernyoowere a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,yoositting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man withyooa grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and hadyoodropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though inyoohis sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upperyoopart of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed someyoomeaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:yooyoo   "His wife a year he fondly lovedyoo    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved."yooyooOr suddenly waking up again:yooyoo   "Walking along the crowded rowyoo    He met the one he used to know."yooyooBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked withyoopositive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There wasyooanother man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired governmentyooclerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot andyoolooking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIyooyooRaskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoidedyoosociety of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once heyoofelt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be takingyooplace within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. Heyoowas so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomyyooexcitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some otheryooworld, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of theyoosurroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.yooyooThe master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequentlyyoocame down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots withyoored turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of hisyooperson. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,yoowith no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like anyooiron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there wasyooanother boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On theyoocounter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, andyoosome fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferablyyooclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in suchyooan atmosphere might well make a man drunk.yooyooThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from theyoofirst moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made onyooRaskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who lookedyoolike a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impressionyooafterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedlyyooat the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staringyoopersistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. Atyoothe other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerkyoolooked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showingyooa shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station andyooculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him toyooconverse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,yooand stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was ofyooa yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keenyooreddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something veryyoostrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intenseyoofeeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at theyoosame time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing anyooold and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missingyooexcept one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to thisyoolast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spotsyooand stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he woreyoono beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chinyoolooked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectableyooand like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; heyooruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into hisyoohands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and stickyyootable. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly andyooresolutely:yooyoo"May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?yooForasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, myyooexperience admonishes me that you are a man of education and notyooaccustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when inyooconjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titularyoocounsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. Iyoomake bold to inquire--have you been in the service?"yooyoo"No, I am studying," answered the young man, somewhat surprised atyoothe grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directlyyooaddressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling foryoocompany of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately hisyoohabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approachedyooor attempted to approach him.yooyoo"A student then, or formerly a student," cried the clerk. "Just whatyooI thought! I'm a man of experience, immense experience, sir," and heyootapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. "You've been ayoostudent or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me...."yooHe got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down besideyoothe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spokeyoofluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of hisyoosentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov asyoogreedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.yooyoo"Honoured sir," he began almost with solemnity, "poverty is not a vice,yoothat's a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,yooand that that's even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is ayoovice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, butyooin beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of humanyoosociety with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it asyoohumiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggaryyooI am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!yooHonoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, andyoomy wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow meyooto ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spentyooa night on a hay barge, on the Neva?"yooyoo"No, I have not happened to," answered Raskolnikov. "What do you mean?"yooyoo"Well, I've just come from one and it's the fifth night I've sleptyooso...." He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were inyoofact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quiteyooprobable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.yooHis hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with blackyoonails.yooyooHis conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. Theyooboys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from theyooupper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the "funny fellow"yooand sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.yooEvidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had mostyoolikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit ofyoofrequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts inyoothe tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, andyooespecially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in orderyooat home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justifyyoothemselves and even if possible obtain consideration.yooyoo"Funny fellow!" pronounced the innkeeper. "And why don't you work, whyyooaren't you at your duty, if you are in the service?"yooyoo"Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir," Marmeladov went on, addressingyoohimself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who putyoothat question to him. "Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart acheyooto think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikovyoobeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn't I suffer?yooExcuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, toyoopetition hopelessly for a loan?"yooyoo"Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?"yooyoo"Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that youyoowill get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positiveyoocertainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, willyooon no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?yooFor he knows of course that I shan't pay it back. From compassion? ButyooMr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other dayyoothat compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that'syoowhat is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, Iyooask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand thatyoohe won't, I set off to him and..."yooyoo"Why do you go?" put in Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man mustyoohave somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely mustyoogo somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,yoothen I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport)," he addedyooin parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.yoo"No matter, sir, no matter!" he went on hurriedly and with apparentyoocomposure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even theyooinnkeeper smiled--"No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging ofyootheir heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and allyoothat is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, butyoowith humility. So be it! So be it! 'Behold the man!' Excuse me, youngyooman, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; notyoo_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?"yooyooThe young man did not answer a word.yooyoo"Well," the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,yooafter waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. "Well, so beyooit, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, butyooKaterina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer'syoodaughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of ayoonoble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,yooif only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every manyooought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But KaterinayooIvanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, althoughyooI realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--foryooI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man," heyoodeclared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--"but, myyooGod, if she would but once.... But no, no! It's all in vain and it's noyoouse talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come trueyooand more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am ayoobeast by nature!"yooyoo"Rather!" assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fistyooresolutely on the table.yooyoo"Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her veryyoostockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in theyooorder of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!yooHer mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her ownyooproperty, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold thisyoowinter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have threeyoolittle children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning tillyoonight; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she'syoobeen used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she hasyooa tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don't feel it?yooAnd the more I drink the more I feel it. That's why I drink too. I tryyooto find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may sufferyootwice as much!" And as though in despair he laid his head down on theyootable.yooyoo"Young man," he went on, raising his head again, "in your face I seem toyooread some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was whyyooI addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, Iyoodo not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,yoowho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a manyooof feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in ayoohigh-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving sheyoodanced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages foryoowhich she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.yooThe medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but theyoocertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showedyooit to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad termsyoowith the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her pastyoohonours and of the happy days that are gone. I don't condemn her foryooit, I don't blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection ofyoothe past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a ladyyooof spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and hasyoonothing but black bread to eat, but won't allow herself to be treatedyoowith disrespect. That's why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov'syoorudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took toyooher bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She wasyooa widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than theyooother. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, andyooran away with him from her father's house. She was exceedingly fond ofyooher husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that heyoodied. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, ofyoowhich I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks ofyoohim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am gladyoothat, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as havingyooonce been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children inyooa wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and sheyoowas left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many upsyooand downs of all sort, I don't feel equal to describing it even. Heryoorelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessivelyyooproud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time ayoowidower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offeredyooher my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You canyoojudge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of educationyooand culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be myyoowife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, sheyoomarried me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do youyoounderstand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,yoothat you don't understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performedyoomy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this" (heyootapped the jug with his finger), "for I have feelings. But even so, Iyoocould not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through noyoofault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touchyooit!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves atyoolast after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificentyoocapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained ayoosituation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? Thisyootime it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had comeyooout.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel's;yooand what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.yooThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt andyoodisorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter byyoomy first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up withyoofrom her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won't speak of. For,yoothough Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spiritedyoolady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it's no use going overyoothat! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make anyooeffort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universalyoohistory, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and weyoohad no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have notyooeven those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped atyooCyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has readyooother books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with greatyoointerest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes' Physiology--doyooyou know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that's theyoowhole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honouredyoosir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose thatyooa respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteenyoofarthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no specialyootalent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what'syoomore, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard ofyoohim?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts sheyoomade him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on theyoopretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and wereyooput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And KaterinayooIvanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushedyoored, as they always are in that disease: 'Here you live with us,' saysyooshe, 'you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.'yooAnd much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for theyoolittle ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what ofyooit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentleyoocreature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thinyoolittle face). She said: 'Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thingyoolike that?' And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and veryyoowell known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at heryoothrough the landlady. 'And why not?' said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,yoo'you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!' But don't blameyooher, don't blame her, honoured sir, don't blame her! She was not herselfyoowhen she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the cryingyooof the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anythingyooelse.... For that's Katerina Ivanovna's character, and when childrenyoocry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o'clockyooI saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of theyooroom and about nine o'clock she came back. She walked straight up toyooKaterina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before heryooin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, sheyoosimply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,yoomade of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay downyooon the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and heryoobody kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....yooAnd then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silenceyoogo up to Sonia's little bed; she was on her knees all the eveningyookissing Sonia's feet, and would not get up, and then they both fellyooasleep in each other's arms... together, together... yes... and I... layyoodrunk."yooyooMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then heyoohurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.yooyoo"Since then, sir," he went on after a brief pause--"Since then, owingyooto an unfortunate occurrence and through information given byyooevil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took ayooleading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want ofyoorespect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to takeyooa yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living withyoous. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (thoughyooshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...yoohm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia'syooaccount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all ofyooa sudden he stood on his dignity: 'how,' said he, 'can a highly educatedyooman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?' And KaterinayooIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that'syoohow it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; sheyoocomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a roomyooat the Kapernaumovs' the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov isyooa lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleftyoopalates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in oneyooroom, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very pooryoopeople and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,yooand put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to hisyooexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do youyooknow him? No? Well, then, it's a man of God you don't know. He is wax...yoowax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes wereyoodim when he heard my story. 'Marmeladov, once already you haveyoodeceived my expectations... I'll take you once more on my ownyooresponsibility'--that's what he said, 'remember,' he said, 'and now youyoocan go.' I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in realityyoohe would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man ofyoomodern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when Iyooannounced that I'd been taken back into the service and should receive ayoosalary, heavens, what a to-do there was!..."yooyooMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a wholeyooparty of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the soundsyooof a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of sevenyoosinging "The Hamlet" were heard in the entry. The room was filled withyoonoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.yooMarmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.yooHe appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and moreyoodrunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of hisyoorecent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and wasyoopositively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikovyoolistened attentively.yooyoo"That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovnayooand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into theyookingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing butyooabuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. 'SemyonyooZaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!'yooThey made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! Theyyoobegan to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managedyooto get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fiftyyoocopecks, I can't guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,yooa uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles andyooa half. The first morning I came back from the office I found KaterinayooIvanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat withyoohorse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not anyyoodresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were goingyooon a visit; and not that she'd anything to do it with, she smartenedyooherself up with nothing at all, she'd done her hair nicely, put on ayooclean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a differentyooperson, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,yoohad only helped with money 'for the time,' she said, 'it won't do for meyooto come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.' Doyooyou hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do youyoothink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree withyooour landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could notyooresist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,yoowhispering together. 'Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,yoonow, and receiving a salary,' says she, 'and he went himself to hisyooexcellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all theyooothers wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody intoyoohis study.' Do you hear, do you hear? 'To be sure,' says he, 'SemyonyooZaharovitch, remembering your past services,' says he, 'and in spiteyooof your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now andyoosince moreover we've got on badly without you,' (do you hear, do youyoohear;) 'and so,' says he, 'I rely now on your word as a gentleman.' Andyooall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and notyoosimply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes ityooall herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word sheyoodoes! And I don't blame her for it, no, I don't blame her!... Six daysyooago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roublesyooforty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: 'poppet,' said she,yoo'my little poppet.' And when we were by ourselves, you understand?yooYou would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as ayoohusband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, 'my little poppet,'yoosaid she."yooyooMarmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin beganyooto twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degradedyooappearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot ofyoospirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewilderedyoohis listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.yooHe felt vexed that he had come here.yooyoo"Honoured sir, honoured sir," cried Marmeladov recovering himself--"Oh,yoosir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does toyooothers, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all theyootrivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.yooFor I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my lifeyooand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I wouldyooarrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I shouldyoogive her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonouryooand restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....yooQuite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir" (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sortyooof start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) "well, onyoothe very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly fiveyoodays ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,yooI stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what wasyooleft of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now lookyooat me, all of you! It's the fifth day since I left home, and they areyoolooking for me there and it's the end of my employment, and my uniformyoois lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for theyoogarments I have on... and it's the end of everything!"yooyooMarmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closedyoohis eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minuteyoolater his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness andyooaffectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:yooyoo"This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!yooHe-he-he!"yooyoo"You don't say she gave it to you?" cried one of the new-comers; heyooshouted the words and went off into a guffaw.yooyoo"This very quart was bought with her money," Marmeladov declared,yooaddressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. "Thirty copecks she gaveyoome with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She saidyoonothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but upyooyonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don't blame them,yoothey don't blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don'tyooblame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What doyooyou think, my dear sir? For now she's got to keep up her appearance. Ityoocosts money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do youyoounderstand? And there's pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;yoopetticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off heryoofoot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do youyoounderstand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,yoohere I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinkingyooit! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man likeyoome, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorryyooor not? He-he-he!"yooyooHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot wasyooempty.yooyoo"What are you to be pitied for?" shouted the tavern-keeper who was againyoonear them.yooyooShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oathsyoocame from those who were listening and also from those who had heardyoonothing but were simply looking at the figure of the dischargedyoogovernment clerk.yooyoo"To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?" Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,yoostanding up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been onlyyoowaiting for that question.yooyoo"Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there's nothing to pity me for! Iyooought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,yoooh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to beyoocrucified, for it's not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...yooDo you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has beenyoosweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears andyootribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pityyoous Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and allyoothings, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that dayyooand He will ask: 'Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,yooconsumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where isyoothe daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,yooundismayed by his beastliness?' And He will say, 'Come to me! I haveyooalready forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sinsyoowhich are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....' And heyoowill forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in myyooheart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgiveyooall, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He hasyoodone with all of them, then He will summon us. 'You too come forth,'yooHe will say, 'Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, comeyooforth, ye children of shame!' And we shall all come forth, without shameyooand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, 'Ye are swine, madeyooin the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!' And theyoowise ones and those of understanding will say, 'Oh Lord, why dost Thouyooreceive these men?' And He will say, 'This is why I receive them, oh yeyoowise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not oneyooof them believed himself to be worthy of this.' And He will hold out Hisyoohands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...yooand we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... andyooall will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....yooLord, Thy kingdom come!" And he sank down on the bench exhausted, andyoohelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundingsyooand plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;yoothere was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heardyooagain.yooyoo"That's his notion!"yooyoo"Talked himself silly!"yooyoo"A fine clerk he is!"yooyooAnd so on, and so on.yooyoo"Let us go, sir," said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head andyooaddressing Raskolnikov--"come along with me... Kozel's house, lookingyoointo the yard. I'm going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did."yooyooRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant toyoohelp him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speechyooand leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundredyoopaces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay andyooconfusion as they drew nearer the house.yooyoo"It's not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now," he muttered inyooagitation--"and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hairyoomatter! Bother my hair! That's what I say! Indeed it will be better ifyooshe does begin pulling it, that's not what I am afraid of... it's heryooeyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,yoofrightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how peopleyooin that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened ofyoothe children's crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...yooI don't know what's happened! I don't know! But blows I am not afraidyooof.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even anyooenjoyment. In fact I can't get on without it.... It's better so. Letyooher strike me, it relieves her heart... it's better so... There is theyoohouse. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.yooLead the way!"yooyooThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircaseyoogot darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o'clockyooand although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it wasyooquite dark at the top of the stairs.yooyooA grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A veryyoopoor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;yoothe whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,yoolittered up with rags of all sorts, especially children's garments.yooAcross the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind ityooprobably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairsyooand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before whichyoostood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edgeyooof the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. Ityooappeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,yoobut their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the otheryoorooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel's flat wasyoodivided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughteryoowithin. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Wordsyooof the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.yooyooRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,yooslim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brownyoohair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and downyooin her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lipsyoowere parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyesyooglittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. Andyoothat consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of theyoocandle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed toyooRaskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife foryooMarmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.yooShe seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The roomyoowas close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from theyoostaircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inneryoorooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did notyooclose the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sittingyoocurled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year olderyoostood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had ayoobeating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,yoowearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flungyooover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.yooHer arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother's neck. She wasyootrying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all sheyoocould to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her largeyoodark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightenedyooface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter theyoodoor, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikovyooin front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferentlyyoofacing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering whatyoohe had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going intoyoothe next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking noyoofurther notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close ityooand uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in theyoodoorway.yooyoo"Ah!" she cried out in a frenzy, "he has come back! The criminal! theyoomonster!... And where is the money? What's in your pocket, show me! Andyooyour clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is theyoomoney! Speak!"yooyooAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obedientlyyooheld up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.yooyoo"Where is the money?" she cried--"Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?yooThere were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!" and in a furyyooshe seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladovyooseconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.yooyoo"And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is ayoopositive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir," he called out, shaken to andyoofro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.yooThe child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in theyoocorner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushedyooto his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl wasyooshaking like a leaf.yooyoo"He's drunk it! he's drunk it all," the poor woman screamed inyoodespair--"and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!"--andyoowringing her hands she pointed to the children. "Oh, accursed life!yooAnd you, are you not ashamed?"--she pounced all at once uponyooRaskolnikov--"from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You haveyoobeen drinking with him, too! Go away!"yooyooThe young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner dooryoowas thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarseyoolaughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrustyoothemselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures inyoodressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some ofyoothem with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, whenyooMarmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolationyooto him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrillyoooutcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing heryooway amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion andyoofor the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering heryoowith coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,yooRaskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up theyoocoppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and toyoolay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changedyoohis mind and would have gone back.yooyoo"What a stupid thing I've done," he thought to himself, "they have Soniayooand I want it myself." But reflecting that it would be impossible toyootake it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, heyoodismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.yoo"Sonia wants pomatum too," he said as he walked along the street, and heyoolaughed malignantly--"such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Soniayooherself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, huntingyoobig game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crustyooto-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they've dugyoothere! And they're making the most of it! Yes, they are making the mostyooof it! They've wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used toyooeverything, the scoundrel!"yooyooHe sank into thought.yooyoo"And what if I am wrong," he cried suddenly after a moment's thought.yoo"What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, theyoowhole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificialyooterrors and there are no barriers and it's all as it should be."yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIIyooyooHe waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had notyoorefreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and lookedyoowith hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about sixyoopaces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dustyyooyellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a manyooof more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every momentyoothat he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was inyookeeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; ayoopainted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;yoothe dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been longyoountouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall andyoohalf the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, butyoowas now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleepyooon it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his oldyoostudent's overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which heyooheaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. Ayoolittle table stood in front of the sofa.yooyooIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but toyooRaskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.yooHe had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,yooand even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and lookedyoosometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He wasyooin the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentratedyooupon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sendingyoohim in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,yoothough he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,yoowas rather pleased at the lodger's mood and had entirely given upyoosweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray intoyoohis room with a broom. She waked him up that day.yooyoo"Get up, why are you asleep?" she called to him. "It's past nine, I haveyoobrought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you're fairlyyoostarving?"yooyooRaskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.yooyoo"From the landlady, eh?" he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sittingyooup on the sofa.yooyoo"From the landlady, indeed!"yooyooShe set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea andyoolaid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.yooyoo"Here, Nastasya, take it please," he said, fumbling in his pocket (foryoohe had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--"runyooand buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at theyoopork-butcher's."yooyoo"The loaf I'll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn't you rather haveyoosome cabbage soup instead of sausage? It's capital soup, yesterday's. Iyoosaved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It's fine soup."yooyooWhen the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasyayoosat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a countryyoopeasant-woman and a very talkative one.yooyoo"Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you," sheyoosaid.yooyooHe scowled.yooyoo"To the police? What does she want?"yooyoo"You don't pay her money and you won't turn out of the room. That's whatyooshe wants, to be sure."yooyoo"The devil, that's the last straw," he muttered, grinding his teeth,yoo"no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool," he added aloud.yoo"I'll go and talk to her to-day."yooyoo"Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are soyooclever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? Oneyootime you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it youyoodo nothing now?"yooyoo"I am doing..." Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.yooyoo"What are you doing?"yooyoo"Work..."yooyoo"What sort of work?"yooyoo"I am thinking," he answered seriously after a pause.yooyooNastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughteryooand when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering andyooshaking all over till she felt ill.yooyoo"And have you made much money by your thinking?" she managed toyooarticulate at last.yooyoo"One can't go out to give lessons without boots. And I'm sick of it."yooyoo"Don't quarrel with your bread and butter."yooyoo"They pay so little for lessons. What's the use of a few coppers?" heyooanswered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.yooyoo"And you want to get a fortune all at once?"yooyooHe looked at her strangely.yooyoo"Yes, I want a fortune," he answered firmly, after a brief pause.yooyoo"Don't be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you theyooloaf or not?"yooyoo"As you please."yooyoo"Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out."yooyoo"A letter? for me! from whom?"yooyoo"I can't say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Willyooyou pay me back?"yooyoo"Then bring it to me, for God's sake, bring it," cried Raskolnikovyoogreatly excited--"good God!"yooyooA minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,yoofrom the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was ayoolong while since he had received a letter, but another feeling alsoyoosuddenly stabbed his heart.yooyoo"Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness' sake; here are your threeyoocopecks, but for goodness' sake, make haste and go!"yooyooThe letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in heryoopresence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasyayoohad gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then heyoogazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dearyooand familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.yooHe delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;yooit was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheetsyooof note paper were covered with very small handwriting.yooyoo"My dear Rodya," wrote his mother--"it's two months since I last had ayootalk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept meyooawake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for myyooinevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to lookyooto, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What ayoogrief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the universityyoosome months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you hadyoolost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of myyoohundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sentyooyou four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,yoofrom Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is ayookind-hearted man and was a friend of your father's too. But having givenyoohim the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt wasyoopaid off and that is only just done, so that I've been unable to sendyooyou anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shallyoobe able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulateyooourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. Inyoothe first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sisteryoohas been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not beyooseparated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I willyootell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everythingyoohas happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When youyoowrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a greatyoodeal to put up with in the Svidrigraïlovs' house, when you wrote thatyooand asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer toyooyou? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would haveyoothrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk allyoothe way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would notyoolet your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could Iyoodo? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. Whatyoomade it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roublesyooin advance when she took the place as governess in their family, onyoocondition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so ityoowas impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.yooThis sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she tookyoochiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terriblyyoothen and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,yoowriting that this money came from Dounia's savings, but that was notyooso, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things haveyoosuddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia lovesyooyou and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treatedyooher very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks atyootable.... But I don't want to go into all those painful details, so asyoonot to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spiteyooof the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov'syoowife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,yooespecially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimentalyoohabits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think ityoowas all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow hadyooconceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealedyooit under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed andyoohorrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years andyoohis being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.yooAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hideyoothe truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the faceyooto make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts ofyooinducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take heryooto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she wentyoothrough! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only onyooaccount of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of MarfayooPetrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Douniayoowould have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it wouldyoohave meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have beenyooinevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia couldyoonot hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You knowyooDounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will sheyoohas. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult casesyooshe has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even writeyooto me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we wereyooconstantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. MarfayooPetrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in theyoogarden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threwyoothe blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awfulyooscene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovnayoowent so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and wasyooshouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia shouldyoobe packed off at once to me in a plain peasant's cart, into which theyyooflung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, withoutyoofolding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,yooand Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in anyooopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answeryoocould I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago andyoowhat could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write toyooyou the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortifiedyooand indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruinyooyourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letteryoowith trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For ayoowhole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it cameyooto such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on accountyooof the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud aboutyoous. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in theyoostreet, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending toyooinsult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,yooso that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was setyoogoing by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt atyooher in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and thatyoomonth she was continually coming into the town, and as she isyoorather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs andyooparticularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is notyooat all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only inyoothe town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, butyooDounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen howyooshe endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She isyooan angel! But by God's mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.yooSvidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probablyyoofeeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete andyoounmistakable proof of Dounia's innocence, in the form of a letter Douniayoohad been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovnayoocame upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.yooSvidrigaïlov's hands after her departure, she had written to refuseyoopersonal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreatingyooher. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignationyoofor the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, remindingyoohim that he was the father and head of a family and telling him howyooinfamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,yoounhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly andyootouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannotyooread it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,yoocleared Dounia's reputation; they had seen and known a great deal moreyoothan Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the caseyoowith servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and 'againyoocrushed' as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced ofyooDounia's innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straightyooto the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to giveyooher strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then sheyoocame straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, weptyoobitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her toyooforgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to allyoothe houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted inyoothe most flattering terms Dounia's innocence and the nobility ofyooher feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read toyooeveryone the letter in Dounia's own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov andyooeven allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think wasyoosuperfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving aboutyoothe whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedenceyoohaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, soyoothat in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyoneyooknew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading theyooletter in such and such a place and people assembled for every readingyooof it, even many who had heard it several times already both in theiryooown houses and in other people's. In my opinion a great deal, a veryyoogreat deal of all this was unnecessary; but that's Marfa Petrovna'syoocharacter. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia'syooreputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelibleyoodisgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I reallyyoobegan to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow tooyooharshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,yoobut she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with markedyoorespect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one mayyoosay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,yoothat Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marryyoohim. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has beenyooarranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrievedyoowith me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that weyoocould not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And youyoocould not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. Thisyoowas how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, PyotryooPetrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, whoyoohas been very active in bringing the match about. It began with hisyooexpressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He wasyooproperly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sentyoous a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for ayoospeedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurryyooto get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,yooof course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quicklyyooand unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is ayoowell-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the governmentyooand has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five yearsyooold, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still beyoothought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable andyoopresentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.yooBut possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.yooAnd beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly willyoodo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, ifyoothere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you thisyoowarning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impressionyooupon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must beyoodeliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,yoowhich are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And PyotryooPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.yooAt his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, butyoostill he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions 'of ouryoomost rising generation' and he is an opponent of all prejudices. Heyoosaid a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to beyoolistened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood veryyoolittle of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a manyooof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You knowyooyour sister's character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient andyoogenerous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.yooOf course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, butyooDounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will makeyooit her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make heryoohappiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though ityoomust be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides heyoois a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, thatyoohis own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is withyoohim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and evenyoocertain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even inyoothe happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, sheyoorelies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, andyoothat she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their futureyoorelationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,yoofor instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well comeyoofrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. Foryooinstance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia's consent,yooin the course of conversation, he declared that before makingyooDounia's acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl ofyoogood reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experiencedyoopoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to hisyoowife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as heryoobenefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politelyyoothan I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and onlyyooremember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,yoobut slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwardsyooto correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strikeyoome as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia wasyoovexed, and answered that 'words are not deeds,' and that, of course, isyooperfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made upyooher mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and wasyoowalking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down beforeyoothe ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told meyoothat she had decided.yooyoo"I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off foryooPetersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to openyooa legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civilyooand commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an importantyoocase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case beforeyoothe Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, inyooevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very dayyooyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider thatyooyour future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes toyoopass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as ayooprovidential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have evenyooventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.yooHe was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could notyooget on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary toyooa relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for theyooduties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but thenyoohe expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leaveyooyou time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, butyooDounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of feveryoofor the last few days, and has already made a regular plan foryooyour becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in PyotryooPetrovitch's business, which might well be, seeing that you are ayoostudent of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and shareyooall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability ofyoorealising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch's evasiveness, veryyoonatural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmlyyoopersuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over heryoofuture husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are carefulyoonot to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,yooespecially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and mightyootake this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Noryoohas either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we haveyooof his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spokenyooof it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,yoolater on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it ofyoohimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily sinceyooyou may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, andyooreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by youryooown work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agreeyoowith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, thatyoois, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing whenyooyou first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm aboutyooyou, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeingyoohim close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his ownyooopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my preciousyooRodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with PyotryooPetrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,yoofancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than withyoothem, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous andyoodelicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughteryoofor the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it isyoosimply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I haveyoonoticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on withyootheir mothers-in-law, and I don't want to be the least bit in anyone'syooway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, soyoolong as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you andyooDounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the mostyoojoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:yooknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in ayoovery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation ofyooalmost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are toyooset off for Petersburg, exactly when I don't know, but very, very soon,yoopossibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let usyooknow when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit hisyooown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,yooeven before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that isyootoo soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shallyoopress you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thoughtyooof seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marryyooPyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writingyooanything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,yooso much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, foryooa few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsettingyooherself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. Butyooalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as muchyoomoney as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Douniayoois to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I knowyoothat Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roublesyooon the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to sendyooyou twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I amyoouneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch hasyoobeen so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, thatyoois to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and bigyootrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), weyoomust reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where weyoocan't be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. Butyoowe have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we seeyoothat the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts fromyoous to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver weyooknow, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travelyooquite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to sendyooto you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have coveredyootwo sheets already and there is no space left for more; our wholeyoohistory, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,yooI embrace you and send you a mother's blessing till we meet. Love Douniayooyour sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that sheyooloves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,yooRodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. Ifyooonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,yooRodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I amyooafraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit ofyooinfidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,yoodear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you usedyooto lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in thoseyoodays. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, withyoomany kisses.yooyoo"Yours till death,yooyoo"PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV."yooyooyooAlmost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov's face wasyoowet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distortedyooand a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid hisyoohead down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a longyootime. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.yooAt last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that wasyoolike a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. Heyootook up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meetingyooanyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of theyooVassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as thoughyoohastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, withoutyoonoticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to theyooastonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IVyooyooHis mother's letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chiefyoofact in it, he had felt not one moment's hesitation, even whilst he wasyooreading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocablyyoosettled, in his mind: "Never such a marriage while I am alive andyooMr. Luzhin be damned!" "The thing is perfectly clear," he mutteredyooto himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of hisyoodecision. "No, mother, no, Dounia, you won't deceive me! and then theyyooapologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision withoutyoome! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can't be brokenyoooff; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:yoo'Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be inyoopost-haste, almost by express.' No, Dounia, I see it all and I know whatyooyou want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, whenyooyou walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like beforeyoothe Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother's bedroom. Bitter isyoothe ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you haveyoodetermined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, oneyoowho has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so muchyoomore solid and impressive) a man who holds two government posts and whoyooshares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, andyoowho _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beatsyooeverything! And that very Dounia for that very '_seems_' is marryingyoohim! Splendid! splendid!yooyoo"... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about 'ouryoomost rising generation'? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the ideayooof prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!yooI should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with oneyooanother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put intoyoo_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heartyooand in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, andyoobetter not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, fromyoomother's letter it's evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, andyoomother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she wasyoosure to be vexed and 'answered her angrily.' I should think so! Whoyoowould not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questionsyooand when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And whyyoodoes she write to me, 'love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more thanyooherself'? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughteryooto her son? 'You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.' Oh,yoomother!"yooyooHis bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened toyoomeet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.yooyoo"Hm... yes, that's true," he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas thatyoochased each other in his brain, "it is true that 'it needs time and careyooto get to know a man,' but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. Theyoochief thing is he is 'a man of business and _seems_ kind,' that wasyoosomething, wasn't it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,yoono doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in ayoopeasant's cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven inyooit). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can 'travel veryyoocomfortably, third class,' for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. Oneyoomust cut one's coat according to one's cloth, but what about you, Mr.yooLuzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother hasyooto raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it's a matteryooof business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares andyooexpenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. Theyoobusiness man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost lessyoothan their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that theyyoodon't both see all that, or is it that they don't want to see? Andyoothey are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the firstyooblossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what reallyyoomatters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_yooof the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it's ayooforetaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What willyooshe have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles oryootwo 'paper ones' as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What doesyooshe expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasonsyooalready for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after theyoomarriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt letyooslip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: 'Iyooshall refuse,' says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she countingyooon what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension whenyooAfanasy Ivanovitch's debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls andyooembroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don't addyoomore than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I knowyoothat. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin'syoogenerosity; 'he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.'yooYou may wait a long time for that! That's how it always is with theseyooSchilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swanyoowith them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will seeyoonothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side ofyoothe picture, yet they won't face the truth till they are forced to; theyoovery thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away withyooboth hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool'syoocap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhinyoohas any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole andyoothat he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.yooHe will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confoundyoohim!yooyoo"Well,... mother I don't wonder at, it's like her, God bless her, butyoohow could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You wereyoonearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writesyoothat 'Dounia can put up with a great deal.' I know that very well. Iyooknew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a halfyooyears I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that 'Douniayoocan put up with a great deal.' If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlovyooand all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. Andyoonow mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put upyoowith Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority ofyoowives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband'syoobounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Grantedyoothat he 'let it slip,' though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe ityoowas not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon asyoopossible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, butyooshe will have to live with the man. Why! she'd live on black breadyooand water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moralyoofreedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,yoomuch less Mr. Luzhin's money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knewyooher and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there's no denying,yoothe Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! It's a bitter thing to spend one'syoolife a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I knowyooshe would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a Germanyoomaster than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herselfyoofor ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she hasyoonothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been ofyoounalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented toyoobecome his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What's theyoopoint of it? What's the answer? It's clear enough: for herself, for heryoocomfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someoneyooelse she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she willyoosell herself! That's what it all amounts to; for her brother, for heryoomother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,yoo'we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,' freedom, peace, conscienceyooeven, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only myyoodear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learnyooto be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we canyoopersuade ourselves that it is one's duty for a good object. That's justyoolike us, it's as clear as daylight. It's clear that Rodion RomanovitchyooRaskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,yooyes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make himyooa partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he mayyooeven be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end hisyoolife a famous man! But my mother? It's all Rodya, precious Rodya, heryoofirst born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,yooloving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink evenyoofrom Sonia's fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so longyooas the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, bothyooof you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense inyooit? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia's life is no worse than life withyooMr. Luzhin. 'There can be no question of love,' mother writes. And whatyooif there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,yoocontempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to 'keep up youryooappearance,' too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartnessyoomeans? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the sameyoothing as Sonia's and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,yooDounia, it's a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it'syoosimply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to beyoopaid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it's more than you canyoobear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, theyoocurses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a MarfayooPetrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,yooshe is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,yooindeed, what have you taken me for? I won't have your sacrifice, Dounia,yooI won't have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, ityooshall not, it shall not! I won't accept it!"yooyooHe suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.yooyoo"It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You'llyooforbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on youryooside to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, youyoowill devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained ayoopost_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that's all _words_, butyoonow? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? Andyoowhat are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on theiryoohundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs. How areyooyou going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy IvanovitchyooVahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives foryoothem? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blindyoowith knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to ayooshadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may haveyoobecome of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during thoseyooten years? Can you fancy?"yooyooSo he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, andyoofinding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were notyoonew ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It wasyoolong since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, longyooago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed andyoogathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had takenyoothe form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which torturedyoohis heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now hisyoomother's letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clearyoothat he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolvedyooquestions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do ityooquickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...yooyoo"Or throw up life altogether!" he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--"acceptyooone's lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything inyoooneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!"yooyoo"Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you haveyooabsolutely nowhere to turn?" Marmeladov's question came suddenly intoyoohis mind, "for every man must have somewhere to turn...."yooyooHe gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,yooslipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thoughtyoorecurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it mustyoocome back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday'syoothought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, theyoothought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,yooit had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenlyyoobecame aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, andyoothere was a darkness before his eyes.yooyooHe looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wantedyooto sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----yooBoulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. Heyoowalked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a littleyooadventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he hadyoonoticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at firstyoohe took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed hisyoopath. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice theyooroad by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. Butyoothere was at first sight something so strange about the woman in frontyooof him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at firstyooreluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and moreyoointently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was soyoostrange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girlyooquite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and withyoono parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She hadyooon a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, notyooproperly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to theyoowaist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief wasyooflung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl wasyoowalking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. Sheyoodrew Raskolnikov's whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at theyooseat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;yooshe let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,yooapparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at onceyoothat she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. Heyoocould hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him theyooface of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more thanyoofifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy lookingyooand, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she wasyoodoing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, andyooshowed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.yooyooRaskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,yooand stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never muchyoofrequented; and now, at two o'clock, in the stifling heat, it was quiteyoodeserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteenyoopaces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,yootoo, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some objectyooof his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and hadyoofollowed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily atyoohim, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently bidingyoohis time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. Hisyoointentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-setyooman, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips andyoomoustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insultyoothis fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walkedyootowards the gentleman.yooyoo"Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?" he shouted, clenchingyoohis fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.yooyoo"What do you mean?" the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughtyyooastonishment.yooyoo"Get away, that's what I mean."yooyoo"How dare you, you low fellow!"yooyooHe raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, withoutyooreflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men likeyoohimself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and ayoopolice constable stood between them.yooyoo"That's enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. Whatyoodo you want? Who are you?" he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing hisyoorags.yooyooRaskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,yoosoldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.yooyoo"You are just the man I want," Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.yoo"I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too," heyooadded, addressing the gentleman, "come along, I have something to showyooyou."yooyooAnd taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.yooyoo"Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.yooThere is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like ayooprofessional. It's more likely she has been given drink and deceivedyoosomewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they've put heryooout into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, andyoothe way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she hasyoonot dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man's hands;yoothat's evident. And now look there: I don't know that dandy with whom Iyoowas going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seenyooher on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and nowyoohe is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while sheyoois in this state... that's certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I sawyoohim myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and heyoois just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, andyoois standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can weyookeep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?"yooyooThe policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy toyoounderstand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over toyooexamine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.yooyoo"Ah, what a pity!" he said, shaking his head--"why, she is quite ayoochild! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,"yoohe began addressing her, "where do you live?" The girl opened her wearyyooand sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved heryoohand.yooyoo"Here," said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twentyyoocopecks, "here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. Theyooonly thing is to find out her address!"yooyoo"Missy, missy!" the policeman began again, taking the money. "I'll fetchyooyou a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where doyooyou live?"yooyoo"Go away! They won't let me alone," the girl muttered, and once moreyoowaved her hand.yooyoo"Ach, ach, how shocking! It's shameful, missy, it's a shame!" He shookyoohis head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.yooyoo"It's a difficult job," the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as heyoodid so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must haveyooseemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!yooyoo"Did you meet her far from here?" he asked him.yooyoo"I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, inyoothe boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it."yooyoo"Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God haveyoomercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has beenyoodeceived, that's a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....yooAh, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs toyoogentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.yooShe looks refined, too, as though she were a lady," and he bent over heryooonce more.yooyooPerhaps he had daughters growing up like that, "looking like ladies andyoorefined" with pretensions to gentility and smartness....yooyoo"The chief thing is," Raskolnikov persisted, "to keep her out of thisyooscoundrel's hands! Why should he outrage her! It's as clear as day whatyoohe is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!"yooyooRaskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,yooand seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, andyooconfined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly anotheryooten paces away and again halted.yooyoo"Keep her out of his hands we can," said the constable thoughtfully,yoo"if only she'd tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,yoomissy!" he bent over her once more.yooyooShe opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, asyoothough realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in theyoodirection from which she had come. "Oh shameful wretches, they won't letyoome alone!" she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, thoughyoostaggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,yookeeping his eye on her.yooyoo"Don't be anxious, I won't let him have her," the policeman saidyooresolutely, and he set off after them.yooyoo"Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!" he repeated aloud, sighing.yooyooAt that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant ayoocomplete revulsion of feeling came over him.yooyoo"Hey, here!" he shouted after the policeman.yooyooThe latter turned round.yooyoo"Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuseyoohimself." He pointed at the dandy, "What is it to do with you?"yooyooThe policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikovyoolaughed.yooyoo"Well!" ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and heyoowalked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for ayoomadman or something even worse.yooyoo"He has carried off my twenty copecks," Raskolnikov murmured angrilyyoowhen he was left alone. "Well, let him take as much from the otheryoofellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did Iyoowant to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Letyoothem devour each other alive--what is to me? How did I dare to give himyootwenty copecks? Were they mine?"yooyooIn spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down onyoothe deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hardyooto fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himselfyooaltogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin lifeyooanew....yooyoo"Poor girl!" he said, looking at the empty corner where she hadyoosat--"She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will findyooout.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating andyoothen maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, theyooDarya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon beyooslipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospitalyoodirectly (that's always the luck of those girls with respectableyoomothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...yoodrink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--ayoowreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seenyoocases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they've allyoocome to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That's as it shouldyoobe, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every yearyoogo... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remainyoochaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid wordsyoothey have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you've saidyoo'percentage' there's nothing more to worry about. If we had any otheryooword... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were oneyooof the percentage! Of another one if not that one?yooyoo"But where am I going?" he thought suddenly. "Strange, I came out foryoosomething. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was goingyooto Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That's what it was... now Iyooremember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihinyoointo my head just now? That's curious."yooyooHe wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at theyoouniversity. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends atyoothe university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and didyoonot welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gaveyoohim up. He took no part in the students' gatherings, amusements oryooconversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,yooand he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,yooand there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as thoughyoohe were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comradesyooto look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior inyoodevelopment, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs andyoointerests were beneath him.yooyooWith Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved andyoocommunicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any otheryooterms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candidyooyouth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth andyoodignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comradesyoounderstood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,yoothough he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of strikingyooappearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He wasyoosometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.yooOne night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laidyooa gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinkingyoopowers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes wentyootoo far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.yooAnother thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, andyooit seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. Heyoocould lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He wasyoovery poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work ofyooone sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earnyoomoney. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used toyoodeclare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly inyoothe cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up theyoouniversity, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all hisyoomight to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov hadyoonot been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not evenyooknow his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,yoobut Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side thatyoohe might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passedyoohim by, as he did not want to annoy him.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER Vyooyoo"Of course, I've been meaning lately to go to Razumihin's to ask foryoowork, to ask him to get me lessons or something..." Raskolnikov thought,yoo"but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, supposeyoohe shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so thatyooI could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...yoohm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers Iyooearn? That's not what I want now. It's really absurd for me to go toyooRazumihin...."yooyooThe question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even moreyoothan he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinisteryoosignificance in this apparently ordinary action.yooyoo"Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out byyoomeans of Razumihin alone?" he asked himself in perplexity.yooyooHe pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after longyoomusing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantasticyoothought came into his head.yooyoo"Hm... to Razumihin's," he said all at once, calmly, as though he hadyooreached a final determination. "I shall go to Razumihin's of course,yoobut... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when Ityoowill be over and everything will begin afresh...."yooyooAnd suddenly he realised what he was thinking.yooyoo"After It," he shouted, jumping up from the seat, "but is It reallyyoogoing to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?" He left theyooseat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,yoobut the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;yooin that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for ayoomonth past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.yooyooHis nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feelyooshivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort heyoobegan almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at allyoothe objects before him, as though looking for something to distract hisyooattention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment intoyoobrooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,yoohe forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where heyoowas going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, cameyooout on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards theyooislands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his wearyyooeyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him inyooand weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,yoono stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbidyooirritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summeryoovilla standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he sawyooin the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,yooand children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught hisyooattention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, byyooluxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched themyoowith curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished fromyoohis sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he hadyoothirty copecks. "Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for theyooletter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovsyooyesterday," he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but heyoosoon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.yooHe recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that heyoowas hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate ayoopie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a longyoowhile since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,yoothough he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy andyooa great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reachingyooPetrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the roadyoointo the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.yooyooIn a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singularyooactuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At timesyoomonstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture areyooso truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, butyooso artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist likeyooPushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the wakingyoostate. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make ayoopowerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.yooyooRaskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhoodyooin the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,yoowalking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. Ityoowas a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;yooindeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done inyoomemory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, notyooeven a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a darkyooblur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last marketyoogarden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him ayoofeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.yooThere was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,yoohideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-lookingyoofigures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to hisyoofather, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the roadyoobecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was ayoowinding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to theyooright to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stoneyoochurch with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or threeyootimes a year with his father and mother, when a service was held inyoomemory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had neveryooseen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in ayootable napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it inyoothe shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadornedyooikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother'syoograve, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his youngeryoobrother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,yoobut he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visitedyoothe graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself andyooto bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he wasyoowalking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; heyoowas holding his father's hand and looking with dread at the tavern. Ayoopeculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to beyoosome kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressedyootownspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,yooall singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavernyoostood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usuallyyoodrawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavyyoogoods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with theiryoolong manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfectyoomountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier goingyoowith a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts ofyoosuch a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants'yoonags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy loadyooof wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or inyooa rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes evenyooabout the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them thatyoohe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from theyoowindow. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singingyooand the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunkenyoopeasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown overyootheir shoulders.yooyoo"Get in, get in!" shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant withyooa fleshy face red as a carrot. "I'll take you all, get in!"yooyooBut at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in theyoocrowd.yooyoo"Take us all with a beast like that!"yooyoo"Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?"yooyoo"And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!"yooyoo"Get in, I'll take you all," Mikolka shouted again, leaping first intoyoothe cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. "The bayyoohas gone with Matvey," he shouted from the cart--"and this brute, mates,yoois just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She's justyooeating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I'll make her gallop! She'llyoogallop!" and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish toyooflog the little mare.yooyoo"Get in! Come along!" The crowd laughed. "D'you hear, she'll gallop!"yooyoo"Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!"yooyoo"She'll jog along!"yooyoo"Don't you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!"yooyoo"All right! Give it to her!"yooyooThey all clambered into Mikolka's cart, laughing and making jokes. Sixyoomen got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,yoorosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beadedyooheaddress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.yooThe crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they helpyoolaughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at ayoogallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready toyoohelp Mikolka. With the cry of "now," the mare tugged with all her might,yoobut far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled withyooher legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips whichyoowere showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in theyoocrowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashedyoothe mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.yooyoo"Let me get in, too, mates," shouted a young man in the crowd whoseyooappetite was aroused.yooyoo"Get in, all get in," cried Mikolka, "she will draw you all. I'll beatyooher to death!" And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himselfyoowith fury.yooyoo"Father, father," he cried, "father, what are they doing? Father, theyyooare beating the poor horse!"yooyoo"Come along, come along!" said his father. "They are drunken andyoofoolish, they are in fun; come away, don't look!" and he tried to drawyoohim away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himselfyoowith horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She wasyoogasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.yooyoo"Beat her to death," cried Mikolka, "it's come to that. I'll do foryooher!"yooyoo"What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?" shouted an old manyooin the crowd.yooyoo"Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such ayoocartload," said another.yooyoo"You'll kill her," shouted the third.yooyoo"Don't meddle! It's my property, I'll do what I choose. Get in, more ofyooyou! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!..."yooyooAll at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,yooroused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old manyoocould not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like thatyootrying to kick!yooyooTwo lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat heryooabout the ribs. One ran each side.yooyoo"Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes," cried Mikolka.yooyoo"Give us a song, mates," shouted someone in the cart and everyone in theyoocart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. Theyoowoman went on cracking nuts and laughing.yooyoo... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whippedyooacross the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, hisyootears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip acrossyoothe face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, heyoorushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who wasyooshaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand andyoowould have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back toyoothe mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.yooyoo"I'll teach you to kick," Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw downyoothe whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,yoothick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effortyoobrandished it over the mare.yooyoo"He'll crush her," was shouted round him. "He'll kill her!"yooyoo"It's my property," shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with ayooswinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.yooyoo"Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?" shouted voices in theyoocrowd.yooyooAnd Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second timeyooon the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, butyoolurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first onyooone side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the sixyoowhips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raisedyooagain and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measuredyooblows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.yooyoo"She's a tough one," was shouted in the crowd.yooyoo"She'll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her," saidyooan admiring spectator in the crowd.yooyoo"Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off," shouted a third.yooyoo"I'll show you! Stand off," Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw downyoothe shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. "Lookyooout," he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at theyoopoor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,yoobut the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell onyoothe ground like a log.yooyoo"Finish her off," shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out ofyoothe cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anythingyoothey could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dyingyoomare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with theyoocrowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.yooyoo"You butchered her," someone shouted in the crowd.yooyoo"Why wouldn't she gallop then?"yooyoo"My property!" shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the baryooin his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more toyoobeat.yooyoo"No mistake about it, you are not a Christian," many voices wereyooshouting in the crowd.yooyooBut the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through theyoocrowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head andyookissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up andyooflew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instantyoohis father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carriedyoohim out of the crowd.yooyoo"Come along, come! Let us go home," he said to him.yooyoo"Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!" he sobbed, but hisyoovoice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.yooyoo"They are drunk.... They are brutal... it's not our business!" said hisyoofather. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. Heyootried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.yooyooHe waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, andyoostood up in terror.yooyoo"Thank God, that was only a dream," he said, sitting down under a treeyooand drawing deep breaths. "But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?yooSuch a hideous dream!"yooyooHe felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. Heyoorested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.yooyoo"Good God!" he cried, "can it be, can it be, that I shall really take anyooaxe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that Iyooshall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;yoohide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can ityoobe?"yooyooHe was shaking like a leaf as he said this.yooyoo"But why am I going on like this?" he continued, sitting up again, as ityoowere in profound amazement. "I knew that I could never bring myselfyooto it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,yooyesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday Iyoorealised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I goingyooover it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairsyooyesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... theyoovery thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.yooyoo"No, I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Granted, granted that there isyoono flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this lastyoomonth is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn'tyoobring myself to it! I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Why, why then amyooI still...?"yooyooHe rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised atyoofinding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,yoohis eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenlyyooto breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden thatyoohad so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a senseyooof relief and peace in his soul. "Lord," he prayed, "show me my path--Iyoorenounce that accursed... dream of mine."yooyooCrossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at theyooglowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness heyoowas not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had beenyooforming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,yoofreedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!yooyooLater on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him duringyoothose days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiouslyyooimpressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not veryyooexceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestinedyooturning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain toyoohimself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have beenyoomore convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,yoohe had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It wasyooobviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. Ityoois true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home withoutyoonoticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always askingyoohimself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same timeyoosuch an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where heyoohad moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of hisyoolife when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstancesyooin which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisiveyooinfluence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait foryoohim on purpose!yooyooIt was about nine o'clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tablesyooand the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people wereyooclosing their establishments or clearing away and packing up theiryoowares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers andyoocostermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirtyyooand stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularlyyooliked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlesslyyooin the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,yooand one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. Atyoothe corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set outyoowith tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up toyoogo home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had justyoocome up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyoneyoocalled her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, AlyonayooIvanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn hisyoowatch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizavetayooand she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of aboutyoothirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She wasyooa complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, whoyoomade her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing withyooa bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly andyoodoubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. Theyoomoment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strangeyoosensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothingyooastonishing about this meeting.yooyoo"You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna," theyoohuckster was saying aloud. "Come round to-morrow about seven. They willyoobe here too."yooyoo"To-morrow?" said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable toyoomake up her mind.yooyoo"Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna," gabbledyoothe huckster's wife, a lively little woman. "I look at you, you are likeyoosome little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but ayoostep-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!"yooyoo"But this time don't say a word to Alyona Ivanovna," her husbandyoointerrupted; "that's my advice, but come round to us without asking.yooIt will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have ayoonotion."yooyoo"Am I to come?"yooyoo"About seven o'clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be ableyooto decide for yourself."yooyoo"And we'll have a cup of tea," added his wife.yooyoo"All right, I'll come," said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she beganyooslowly moving away.yooyooRaskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,yoounnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followedyooby a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He hadyoolearnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day atyooseven o'clock Lizaveta, the old woman's sister and only companion, wouldyoobe away from home and that therefore at seven o'clock precisely the oldyoowoman _would be left alone_.yooyooHe was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a manyoocondemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;yoobut he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedomyooof thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocablyyoodecided.yooyooCertainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, heyoocould not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the planyoothan that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would haveyoobeen difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, withyoogreater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries andyooinvestigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whoseyoolife an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIyooyooLater on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and hisyoowife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there wasyoonothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and beenyooreduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, allyoowomen's things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,yoothey were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta's business. Sheyooundertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honestyooand always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a ruleyoolittle and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.yooyooBut Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces ofyoosuperstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.yooAnd in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see somethingyoostrange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiaryooinfluences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knewyoocalled Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation toyoogive him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case heyoomight want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, foryoohe had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he hadyooremembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: hisyoofather's old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,yooa present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. Whenyoohe found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for heryooat the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He gotyootwo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his wayyoohome. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strangeyooidea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, veryyoomuch absorbed him.yooyooAlmost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom heyoodid not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They hadyooplayed a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heardyoothe student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna andyoogive him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; heyoohad just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of courseyooit was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinaryyooimpression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;yoothe student began telling his friend various details about AlyonayooIvanovna.yooyoo"She is first-rate," he said. "You can always get money from her. She isyooas rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time andyooshe is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows haveyoohad dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy...."yooyooAnd he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if youyoowere only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how sheyoogave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even sevenyoopercent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, sayingyoothat she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature wasyoocontinually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,yoothough Lizaveta was at least six feet high.yooyoo"There's a phenomenon for you," cried the student and he laughed.yooyooThey began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with ayoopeculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listenedyoowith great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mendingyoofor him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything aboutyooher. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,yoobeing the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She workedyooday and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and theyoowashing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sisteryooall she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kindyoowithout her sister's permission. The old woman had already made heryoowill, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get ayoofarthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money wasyooleft to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might beyoosaid for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,yoounmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with longyoofeet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore batteredyoogoatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressedyoomost surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta wasyoocontinually with child.yooyoo"But you say she is hideous?" observed the officer.yooyoo"Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, butyooyou know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured faceyooand eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people areyooattracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put upyoowith anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile isyooreally very sweet."yooyoo"You seem to find her attractive yourself," laughed the officer.yooyoo"From her queerness. No, I'll tell you what. I could kill that damnedyooold woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without theyoofaintest conscience-prick," the student added with warmth. The officeryoolaughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!yooyoo"Listen, I want to ask you a serious question," the student said hotly.yoo"I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,yoosenseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simplyyoouseless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she isyooliving for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. Youyoounderstand? You understand?"yooyoo"Yes, yes, I understand," answered the officer, watching his excitedyoocompanion attentively.yooyoo"Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away foryoowant of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand goodyoodeeds could be done and helped, on that old woman's money which will beyooburied in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on theyooright path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, fromyoovice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, takeyooher money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service ofyoohumanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tinyyoocrime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousandsyoowould be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred livesyooin exchange--it's simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life ofyoothat sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!yooNo more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in factyoobecause the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives ofyooothers; the other day she bit Lizaveta's finger out of spite; it almostyoohad to be amputated."yooyoo"Of course she does not deserve to live," remarked the officer, "butyoothere it is, it's nature."yooyoo"Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, butyoofor that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,yoothere would never have been a single great man. They talk ofyooduty, conscience--I don't want to say anything against duty andyooconscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I haveyooanother question to ask you. Listen!"yooyoo"No, you stay, I'll ask you a question. Listen!"yooyoo"Well?"yooyoo"You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill theyooold woman _yourself_?"yooyoo"Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It's nothing toyoodo with me...."yooyoo"But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there's no justice aboutyooit.... Let us have another game."yooyooRaskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinaryyooyouthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before inyoodifferent forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hearyoosuch a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brainyoowas just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at theyoomoment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the oldyoowoman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? Thisyoocoincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavernyoohad an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there hadyooreally been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....yooyoo*****yooyooOn returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and satyoofor a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had noyoocandle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could neveryoorecollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. Atyoolast he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realisedyoowith relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleepyoocame over him, as it were crushing him.yooyooHe slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,yoocoming into his room at ten o'clock the next morning, had difficultyyooin rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again theyoosecond brew and again in her own tea-pot.yooyoo"My goodness, how he sleeps!" she cried indignantly. "And he is alwaysyooasleep."yooyooHe got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn inyoohis garret and sank back on the sofa again.yooyoo"Going to sleep again," cried Nastasya. "Are you ill, eh?"yooyooHe made no reply.yooyoo"Do you want some tea?"yooyoo"Afterwards," he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turningyooto the wall.yooyooNastasya stood over him.yooyoo"Perhaps he really is ill," she said, turned and went out. She came inyooagain at two o'clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stoodyoountouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfullyyoorousing him.yooyoo"Why are you lying like a log?" she shouted, looking at him withyoorepulsion.yooyooHe got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.yooyoo"Are you ill or not?" asked Nastasya and again received no answer.yoo"You'd better go out and get a breath of air," she said after a pause.yoo"Will you eat it or not?"yooyoo"Afterwards," he said weakly. "You can go."yooyooAnd he motioned her out.yooyooShe remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and wentyooout.yooyooA few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long whileyooat the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon andyoobegan to eat.yooyooHe ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it wereyoomechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himselfyooon the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,yoowith his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and suchyoostrange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he wasyooin Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,yoothe camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in ayoocomplete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking wateryoofrom a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it wasyoowonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-colouredyoostones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there likeyoogold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,yooraised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,yoosuddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off theyoosofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and beganyoolistening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quietyooon the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange andyoomonstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from theyooprevious day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... Andyoomeanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefactionyoowere followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distractedyoohaste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all hisyooenergies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heartyookept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he hadyooto make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. Heyoorummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed awayyoounder it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a longyoostrip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He foldedyoothis strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of someyoostout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the twoyooends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shookyooas he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outsideyoowhen he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got readyyoolong before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for theyoonoose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intendedyoofor the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through theyoostreet in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still haveyoohad to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Nowyoohe had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hangyooquietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coatyoopocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it didyoonot swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, ityoocould not be seen from outside that he was holding something with theyoohand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed ayoofortnight before.yooyooWhen he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little openingyoobetween his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew outyoothe _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. Thisyoopledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size andyoothickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of woodyooin one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort ofyooa workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth pieceyooof iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.yooPutting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,yoohe fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread roundyoothem; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper andyootied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. Thisyoowas in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, whileyooshe was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron stripyoowas added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the firstyoominute that the "thing" was made of wood. All this had been stored byyoohim beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out whenyoohe heard someone suddenly about in the yard.yooyoo"It struck six long ago."yooyoo"Long ago! My God!"yooyooHe rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descendyoohis thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still theyoomost important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That theyoodeed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also ayoopocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still lessyooon his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note inyoopassing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken byyoohim in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more finalyoothey were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became inyoohis eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never foryooa single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of hisyooplans.yooyooAnd, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least pointyoocould have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty ofyooany kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it allyooas something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass ofyoounsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,yoothat trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.yooNastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;yooshe would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left theyoodoor ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding heryooabout. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly intoyoothe kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everythingyoowas over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.yooSupposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya hadyoocome back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and waityootill she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to missyoothe axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or atyooleast grounds for suspicion.yooyooBut those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, andyooindeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put offyootrifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemedyooutterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could notyooimagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, getyooup and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit withyoothe object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt atyooan experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should sayyoo"come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!"--and at once heyoohad broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.yooMeanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that hisyooanalysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and heyoocould not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resortyoohe simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly soughtyooarguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone wereyooforcing and drawing him to it.yooyooAt first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with oneyooquestion; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easilyyoodetected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? Heyoohad come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in hisyooopinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibilityyooof concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost everyyoocriminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by ayoochildish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudenceyooand caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipseyooof reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,yoodeveloped gradually and reached its highest point just before theyooperpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the momentyooof the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to theyooindividual case, and then passed off like any other disease. Theyooquestion whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether theyoocrime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something ofyoothe nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.yooyooWhen he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case thereyoocould not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will wouldyooremain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for theyoosimple reason that his design was "not a crime...." We will omit all theyooprocess by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we haveyoorun too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purelyyoomaterial difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in hisyoomind. "One has but to keep all one's will-power and reason to dealyoowith them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one hasyoofamiliarised oneself with the minutest details of the business...." Butyoothis preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what heyoocame to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quiteyoodifferently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.yooyooOne trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had evenyooleft the staircase. When he reached the landlady's kitchen, the dooryooof which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, inyooNastasya's absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whetheryoothe door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out whenyoohe went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenlyyoosaw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupiedyoothere, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeingyoohim, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at himyooall the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past asyoothough he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had notyoothe axe! He was overwhelmed.yooyoo"What made me think," he reflected, as he went under the gateway, "whatyoomade me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!yooWhy, why, why did I assume this so certainly?"yooyooHe was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself inyoohis anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.yooyooHe stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walkyoofor appearance' sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even moreyoorevolting. "And what a chance I have lost for ever!" he muttered,yoostanding aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter's littleyoodark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter'syooroom, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to theyooright caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached theyooroom on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice calledyoothe porter. "Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, foryoothe door is wide open." He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulledyooit out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;yooat once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust bothyoohands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!yoo"When reason fails, the devil helps!" he thought with a strange grin.yooThis chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.yooyooHe walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakeningyoosuspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape lookingyooat their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.yooSuddenly he thought of his hat. "Good heavens! I had the money the dayyoobefore yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!" A curse roseyoofrom the bottom of his soul.yooyooGlancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock onyoothe wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and atyoothe same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from theyooother side....yooyooWhen he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimesyoothought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very muchyooafraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupiedyooby irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupovyoogarden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of greatyoofountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in allyoothe squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summeryoogarden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to theyoogarden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and ayoogreat benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question whyyooin all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in someyoopeculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where thereyooare no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and allyoosorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came backyooto his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. "What nonsense!"yoohe thought, "better think of nothing at all!"yooyoo"So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object thatyoomeets them on the way," flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,yoolike lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by nowyoohe was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clockyoosomewhere struck once. "What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, ityoomust be fast!"yooyooLuckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that veryyoomoment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay hadyoojust driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed underyoothe gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through intoyoothe yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the otheryooside of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no oneyoonoticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that hugeyooquadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise hisyoohead--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the oldyoowoman's room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He wasyooalready on the stairs....yooyooDrawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, andyooonce more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softlyyooand cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But theyoostairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met noyooone. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters wereyooat work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thoughtyooa minute and went on. "Of course it would be better if they had not beenyoohere, but... it's two storeys above them."yooyooAnd there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was theyooflat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman's wasyooapparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had beenyootorn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instantyoothe thought floated through his mind "Shall I go back?" But he made noyooanswer and began listening at the old woman's door, a dead silence. Thenyoohe listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...yoothen looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drewyoohimself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. "Am I very pale?"yoohe wondered. "Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had Iyoobetter wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?"yooyooBut his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spiteyoohim, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,yoohe slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later heyoorang again, more loudly.yooyooNo answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old womanyoowas, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had someyooknowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.yooEither his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult toyoosuppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenlyyooheard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and theyoorustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthilyyooclose to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretlyyoolistening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He movedyooa little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not haveyoothe appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,yooand without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood outyooin his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how heyoohad had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments andyoohe was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard theyoolatch unfastened.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIIyooyooThe door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp andyoosuspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lostyoohis head and nearly made a great mistake.yooyooFearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and notyoohoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he tookyoohold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman fromyooattempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,yoobut she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out withyooit on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway notyooallowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped backyooin alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and staredyoowith open eyes at him.yooyoo"Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna," he began, trying to speak easily, butyoohis voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. "I have come... I haveyoobrought something... but we'd better come in... to the light...."yooyooAnd leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The oldyoowoman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.yooyoo"Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?"yooyoo"Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought youyoothe pledge I promised the other day..." And he held out the pledge.yooyooThe old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared inyoothe eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously andyoomistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneeryooin her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt thatyoohe was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightenedyoothat if she were to look like that and not say a word for another halfyoominute, he thought he would have run away from her.yooyoo"Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?" he said suddenly,yooalso with malice. "Take it if you like, if not I'll go elsewhere, I amyooin a hurry."yooyooHe had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said ofyooitself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor's resolute toneyooevidently restored her confidence.yooyoo"But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?" she asked,yoolooking at the pledge.yooyoo"The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know."yooyooShe held out her hand.yooyoo"But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?yooHave you been bathing, or what?"yooyoo"Fever," he answered abruptly. "You can't help getting pale... if you'veyoonothing to eat," he added, with difficulty articulating the words.yooyooHis strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like theyootruth; the old woman took the pledge.yooyoo"What is it?" she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, andyooweighing the pledge in her hand.yooyoo"A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it."yooyoo"It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!"yooyooTrying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (allyooher windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she leftyoohim altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. Heyoounbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yetyootake it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under theyoocoat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growingyoomore numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip andyoofall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.yooyoo"But what has he tied it up like this for?" the old woman cried withyoovexation and moved towards him.yooyooHe had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swungyooit with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost withoutyooeffort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. Heyooseemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had onceyoobrought the axe down, his strength returned to him.yooyooThe old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streakedyoowith grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat's tail andyoofastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.yooAs she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. Sheyoocried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on theyoofloor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held "theyoopledge." Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt sideyooand on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, theyoobody fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over heryooface; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,yoothe brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.yooyooHe laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in heryoopocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocketyoofrom which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in fullyoopossession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but hisyoohands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had beenyooparticularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to getyoosmeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,yooas before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroomyoowith them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.yooAgainst the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered withyooa silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest ofyoodrawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into theyoochest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passedyooover him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and goyooaway. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.yooHe positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying ideayoooccurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might beyoostill alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,yoohe ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once moreyooover the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt thatyooshe was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he sawyooclearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. Heyoowas about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeedyooit was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool ofyooblood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, butyoothe string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soakedyoowith blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, butyoosomething held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raisedyoothe axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did notyoodare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,yooafter two minutes' hurried effort, he cut the string and took it offyoowithout touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was ayoopurse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one ofyoocopper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasyyoochamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffedyoovery full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,yooflung the crosses on the old woman's body and rushed back into theyoobedroom, this time taking the axe with him.yooyooHe was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying themyooagain. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. Ityoowas not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept makingyoomistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right oneyooand would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he rememberedyooand realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hangingyoothere with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest ofyoodrawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,yooand that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chestyooof drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that oldyoowomen usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was ayoogood-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an archedyoolid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notchedyookey fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, wasyooa coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,yoothen a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below butyooclothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands onyoothe red brocade. "It's red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,"yoothe thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.yoo"Good God, am I going out of my senses?" he thought with terror.yooyooBut no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped fromyoounder the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turnedyooout to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probablyyooall pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,yooear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simplyyoowrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round withyootape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousersyooand overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but heyoohad not time to take many....yooyooHe suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stoppedyooshort and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have beenyoohis fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as thoughyoosomeone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence foryooa minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waitedyooholding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out ofyoothe bedroom.yooyooIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.yooShe was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheetyooand seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run outyooof the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, ayooshudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, butyoostill did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into theyoocorner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered noyoosound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at heryoowith the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies' mouths,yoowhen they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens themyooand are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was soyoosimple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did notyooeven raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessaryyooand natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.yooShe only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holdingyooit out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with theyoosharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of theyoohead. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,yoosnatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.yooyooFear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after thisyoosecond, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the placeyooas fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeingyooand reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all theyoodifficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and theyooabsurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,yooperhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out ofyoothat place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he wouldyoohave flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, andyoonot from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he hadyoodone. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grewyoostronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or evenyoointo the room for anything in the world.yooyooBut a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to takeyoopossession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot whatyoowas of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into theyookitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethoughtyoohim of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.yooHe dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soapyoothat lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his handsyooin the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed theyooblade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood whereyoothere were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it allyoowith some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen andyoothen he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.yooThere was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. Heyoocarefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as wasyoopossible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,yoohis trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to beyoonothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.yooBut he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be somethingyooquite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of theyooroom, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the ideayoothat he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,yooof protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing somethingyooutterly different from what he was now doing. "Good God!" he muttered "Iyoomust fly, fly," and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terroryooawaited him such as he had never known before.yooyooHe stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outeryoodoor from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,yoowas standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,yooall the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after himyooperhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizavetayooafterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect thatyooshe must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!yooyooHe dashed to the door and fastened the latch.yooyoo"But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away...."yooyooHe unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on theyoostaircase.yooyooHe listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,yootwo voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.yoo"What are they about?" He waited patiently. At last all was still, asyoothough suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,yoobut suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someoneyoobegan going downstairs humming a tune. "How is it they all make suchyooa noise?" flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door andyoowaited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking ayoostep towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.yooyooThe steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, butyoohe remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound heyoobegan for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,yooto the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehowyoopeculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Nowyoo_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it wasyoogrowing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. Andyoonow the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed toyoohim all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dreamyooin which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and isyoorooted to the spot and cannot even move one's arms.yooyooAt last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenlyyoostarted, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into theyooflat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,yoonoiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he hadyoodone this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknownyoovisitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite oneyooanother, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, whenyoothe door divided them and he was listening.yooyooThe visitor panted several times. "He must be a big, fat man," thoughtyooRaskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dreamyooindeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.yooyooAs soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware ofyoosomething moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quiteyooseriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violentlyyooand impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horroryooat the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected everyyoominute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seemyoopossible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold theyoofastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over himyooagain. "I shall fall down!" flashed through his mind, but the unknownyoobegan to speak and he recovered himself at once.yooyoo"What's up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!" he bawled in ayoothick voice, "Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,yoomy beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?"yooyooAnd again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times atyoothe bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimateyooacquaintance.yooyooAt this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on theyoostairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them atyoofirst.yooyoo"You don't say there's no one at home," the new-comer cried in ayoocheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went onyoopulling the bell. "Good evening, Koch."yooyoo"From his voice he must be quite young," thought Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Who the devil can tell? I've almost broken the lock," answered Koch.yoo"But how do you come to know me?"yooyoo"Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running atyoobilliards at Gambrinus'."yooyoo"Oh!"yooyoo"So they are not at home? That's queer. It's awfully stupid though.yooWhere could the old woman have gone? I've come on business."yooyoo"Yes; and I have business with her, too."yooyoo"Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping toyooget some money!" cried the young man.yooyoo"We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? Theyooold witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It's out of my way.yooAnd where the devil she can have got to, I can't make out. She sits hereyoofrom year's end to year's end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yetyoohere all of a sudden she is out for a walk!"yooyoo"Hadn't we better ask the porter?"yooyoo"What?"yooyoo"Where she's gone and when she'll be back."yooyoo"Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does goyooanywhere."yooyooAnd he once more tugged at the door-handle.yooyoo"Damn it all. There's nothing to be done, we must go!"yooyoo"Stay!" cried the young man suddenly. "Do you see how the door shakes ifyooyou pull it?"yooyoo"Well?"yooyoo"That shows it's not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear howyoothe hook clanks?"yooyoo"Well?"yooyoo"Why, don't you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If theyyoowere all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with theyookey and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hookyoois clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,yoodon't you see. So there they are sitting inside and don't open theyoodoor!"yooyoo"Well! And so they must be!" cried Koch, astonished. "What are theyyooabout in there?" And he began furiously shaking the door.yooyoo"Stay!" cried the young man again. "Don't pull at it! There must beyoosomething wrong.... Here, you've been ringing and pulling at the dooryooand still they don't open! So either they've both fainted or..."yooyoo"What?"yooyoo"I tell you what. Let's go fetch the porter, let him wake them up."yooyoo"All right."yooyooBoth were going down.yooyoo"Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter."yooyoo"What for?"yooyoo"Well, you'd better."yooyoo"All right."yooyoo"I'm studying the law you see! It's evident, e-vi-dent there's somethingyoowrong here!" the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.yooyooKoch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave oneyootinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, beganyootouching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure onceyoomore that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting heyoobent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lockyooon the inside and so nothing could be seen.yooyooRaskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort ofyoodelirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.yooWhile they were knocking and talking together, the idea several timesyoooccurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through theyoodoor. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,yoowhile they could not open the door! "Only make haste!" was the thoughtyoothat flashed through his mind.yooyoo"But what the devil is he about?..." Time was passing, one minute, andyooanother--no one came. Koch began to be restless.yooyoo"What the devil?" he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting hisyoosentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavyyooboots on the stairs. The steps died away.yooyoo"Good heavens! What am I to do?"yooyooRaskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.yooAbruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door asyoothoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.yooyooHe had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voiceyoobelow--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just goingyooback to the flat.yooyoo"Hey there! Catch the brute!"yooyooSomebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ranyoodown the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.yooyoo"Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!"yooyooThe shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all wasyoostill. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast beganyoonoisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. Heyoodistinguished the ringing voice of the young man. "Hey!"yooyooFilled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling "come whatyoomust!" If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all wasyoolost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were onlyyooa flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on theyooright, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on theyoosecond floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as thoughyoofor his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had justyoorun down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middleyooof the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In oneyooinstant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wallyooand only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.yooThen they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. Heyoowaited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.yooyooNo one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly throughyoothe gateway and turned to the left in the street.yooyooHe knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at theyooflat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, asyoothe door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at theyoobodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess andyoocompletely realise that the murderer had just been there, and hadyoosucceeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They wouldyooguess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they wereyoogoing upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, thoughyoothe next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. "Should heyooslip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,yoohopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,yoohopeless!"yooyooAt last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.yooHere he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less riskyyoobecause there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like ayoograin of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he couldyooscarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.yoo"My word, he has been going it!" someone shouted at him when he came outyooon the canal bank.yooyooHe was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went theyooworse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canalyoobank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being moreyooconspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almostyoofalling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home fromyooquite a different direction.yooyooHe was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of hisyoohouse! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.yooAnd yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and toyooescape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of courseyooincapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not toyoorestore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody's yard. Butyooit all happened fortunately, the door of the porter's room was closedyoobut not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was atyoohome. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that heyoowalked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,yoo"What do you want?" he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. Butyooagain the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axeyooback under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood asyoobefore. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;yoothe landlady's door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himselfyooon the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blankyooforgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would haveyoojumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts wereyoosimply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he couldyoonot rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....yooyooyooyooyooPART IIyooyooyooyooCHAPTER IyooyooSo he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and atyoosuch moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did notyoooccur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to getyoolight. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.yooFearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which heyooheard every night, indeed, under his window after two o'clock. They wokeyoohim up now.yooyoo"Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns," he thought, "it'syoopast two o'clock," and at once he leaped up, as though someone hadyoopulled him from the sofa.yooyoo"What! Past two o'clock!"yooyooHe sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All atyooonce, in one flash, he recollected everything.yooyooFor the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill cameyooover him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before inyoohis sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that hisyooteeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door andyoobegan listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement heyoogazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how heyoocould have come in the night before without fastening the door, and haveyooflung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking hisyoohat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.yooyoo"If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I'm drunkyoobut..."yooyooHe rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedlyyoolooking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were thereyoono traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, heyoobegan taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everythingyooover to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went throughyoohis search three times.yooyooBut there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, whereyoosome thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edgeyooof his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayedyoothreads. There seemed to be nothing more.yooyooSuddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out ofyoothe old woman's box were still in his pockets! He had not thought tillyoothen of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of themyoowhile he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushedyooto take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled outyooeverything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there wasyoonothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper hadyoocome off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He beganyoostuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: "They're in! Allyooout of sight, and the purse too!" he thought gleefully, getting up andyoogazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenlyyoohe shuddered all over with horror; "My God!" he whispered in despair:yoo"what's the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hideyoothings?"yooyooHe had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought ofyoomoney, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.yooyoo"But now, now, what am I glad of?" he thought, "Is that hiding things?yooMy reason's deserting me--simply!"yooyooHe sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by anotheryoounbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair besideyoohim his old student's winter coat, which was still warm though almost inyoorags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness andyoodelirium. He lost consciousness.yooyooNot more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,yooand at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.yooyoo"How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have notyootaken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!yooSuch a piece of evidence!"yooyooHe pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bitsyooamong his linen under the pillow.yooyoo"Pieces of torn linen couldn't rouse suspicion, whatever happened; Iyoothink not, I think not, any way!" he repeated, standing in the middleyooof the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing aboutyoohim again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had notyooforgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,yooand the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be anyooinsufferable torture.yooyoo"Surely it isn't beginning already! Surely it isn't my punishment comingyooupon me? It is!"yooyooThe frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on theyoofloor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!yooyoo"What is the matter with me!" he cried again, like one distraught.yooyooThen a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothesyoowere covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great manyyoostains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them becauseyoohis perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason wasyooclouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on theyoopurse too. "Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I putyoothe wet purse in my pocket!"yooyooIn a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there wereyootraces, stains on the lining of the pocket!yooyoo"So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense andyoomemory, since I guessed it of myself," he thought triumphantly, withyooa deep sigh of relief; "it's simply the weakness of fever, a moment'syoodelirium," and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of hisyootrousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on theyoosock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! Heyooflung off his boots; "traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked withyooblood;" he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... "But what am Iyooto do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?"yooyooHe gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of theyooroom.yooyoo"In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?yooBut what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, betteryoogo out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away," heyoorepeated, sitting down on the sofa again, "and at once, this minute,yoowithout lingering..."yooyooBut his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icyyooshivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.yooyooAnd for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse toyoo"go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so thatyooit may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!" Several timesyoohe tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.yooyooHe was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.yooyoo"Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!" shoutedyooNastasya, banging with her fist on the door. "For whole days togetheryoohe's snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It'syoopast ten."yooyoo"Maybe he's not at home," said a man's voice.yooyoo"Ha! that's the porter's voice.... What does he want?"yooyooHe jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was ayoopositive pain.yooyoo"Then who can have latched the door?" retorted Nastasya. "He's taken toyoobolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wakeyooup!"yooyoo"What do they want? Why the porter? All's discovered. Resist or open?yooCome what may!..."yooyooHe half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.yooyooHis room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving theyoobed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.yooyooNastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant andyoodesperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey foldedyoopaper sealed with bottle-wax.yooyoo"A notice from the office," he announced, as he gave him the paper.yooyoo"From what office?"yooyoo"A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office."yooyoo"To the police?... What for?..."yooyoo"How can I tell? You're sent for, so you go."yooyooThe man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned toyoogo away.yooyoo"He's downright ill!" observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.yooThe porter turned his head for a moment. "He's been in a fever sinceyooyesterday," she added.yooyooRaskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, withoutyooopening it. "Don't you get up then," Nastasya went on compassionately,yooseeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. "You're ill, andyooso don't go; there's no such hurry. What have you got there?"yooyooHe looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from hisyootrousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleepyoowith them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered thatyoohalf waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his handyooand so fallen asleep again.yooyoo"Look at the rags he's collected and sleeps with them, as though he hasyoogot hold of a treasure..."yooyooAnd Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.yooyooInstantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed hisyooeyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rationalyooreflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like thatyoowith a person who was going to be arrested. "But... the police?"yooyoo"You'd better have some tea! Yes? I'll bring it, there's some left."yooyoo"No... I'm going; I'll go at once," he muttered, getting on to his feet.yooyoo"Why, you'll never get downstairs!"yooyoo"Yes, I'll go."yooyoo"As you please."yooyooShe followed the porter out.yooyooAt once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.yooyoo"There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,yooand rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion couldyoodistinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,yoothank God!" Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and beganyooreading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was anyooordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day atyoohalf-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.yooyoo"But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do withyoothe police! And why just to-day?" he thought in agonising bewilderment.yoo"Good God, only get it over soon!"yooyooHe was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke intoyoolaughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.yooyooHe began, hurriedly dressing. "If I'm lost, I am lost, I don't care!yooShall I put the sock on?" he suddenly wondered, "it will get dustieryoostill and the traces will be gone."yooyooBut no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathingyooand horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,yoohe picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.yooyoo"That's all conventional, that's all relative, merely a way of lookingyooat it," he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of hisyoomind, while he was shuddering all over, "there, I've got it on! I haveyoofinished by getting it on!"yooyooBut his laughter was quickly followed by despair.yooyoo"No, it's too much for me..." he thought. His legs shook. "From fear,"yoohe muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. "It's a trick! Theyyoowant to decoy me there and confound me over everything," he mused, asyoohe went out on to the stairs--"the worst of it is I'm almostyoolight-headed... I may blurt out something stupid..."yooyooOn the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just asyoothey were in the hole in the wall, "and very likely, it's on purposeyooto search when I'm out," he thought, and stopped short. But he wasyoopossessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so callyooit, that with a wave of his hand he went on. "Only to get it over!"yooyooIn the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain hadyoofallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stenchyoofrom the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnishyoopedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,yooso that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head goingyooround--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into theyoostreet on a bright sunny day.yooyooWhen he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony ofyootrepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once avertedyoohis eyes.yooyoo"If they question me, perhaps I'll simply tell," he thought, as he drewyoonear the police-station.yooyooThe police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately beenyoomoved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been onceyoofor a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,yoohe saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting withyooa book in his hand. "A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office isyoohere," and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not wantyooto ask questions of anyone.yooyoo"I'll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything..." he thought, asyoohe reached the fourth floor.yooyooThe staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. Theyookitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almostyoothe whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircaseyoowas crowded with porters going up and down with their books under theiryooarms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door ofyoothe office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,yootoo, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of freshyoopaint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.yooyooAfter waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.yooAll the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew himyooon and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room someyooclerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather ayooqueer-looking set. He went up to one of them.yooyoo"What is it?"yooyooHe showed the notice he had received.yooyoo"You are a student?" the man asked, glancing at the notice.yooyoo"Yes, formerly a student."yooyooThe clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was ayooparticularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.yooyoo"There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has noyoointerest in anything," thought Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Go in there to the head clerk," said the clerk, pointing towards theyoofurthest room.yooyooHe went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room andyoopacked full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.yooAmong them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at theyootable opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.yooThe other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,yooexcessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as ayoosaucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.yooRaskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glancedyooat it, said: "Wait a minute," and went on attending to the lady inyoomourning.yooyooHe breathed more freely. "It can't be that!"yooyooBy degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to haveyoocourage and be calm.yooyoo"Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!yooHm... it's a pity there's no air here," he added, "it's stifling.... Ityoomakes one's head dizzier than ever... and one's mind too..."yooyooHe was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losingyoohis self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,yoosomething quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yetyoothe head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through himyooand guess something from his face.yooyooHe was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobileyooface that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed andyoofoppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,yooand wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chainyooon his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner whoyoowas in the room, and said them fairly correctly.yooyoo"Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down," he said casually to theyoogaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though notyooventuring to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.yooyoo"Ich danke," said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sankyoointo the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floatedyooabout the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. Sheyoosmelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling halfyoothe room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile wasyooimpudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.yooyooThe lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, withyoosome noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing ofyoohis shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table andyoosat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from heryooseat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but theyooofficer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture toyoosit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. Heyoohad a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of hisyooface, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much exceptyooa certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly atyooRaskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of hisyoohumiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with hisyooclothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look onyoohim, so that he felt positively affronted.yooyoo"What do you want?" he shouted, apparently astonished that such a raggedyoofellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.yooyoo"I was summoned... by a notice..." Raskolnikov faltered.yooyoo"For the recovery of money due, from _the student_," the head clerkyoointerfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. "Here!" and heyooflung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. "Read that!"yooyoo"Money? What money?" thought Raskolnikov, "but... then... it's certainlyyoonot _that_."yooyooAnd he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. Ayooload was lifted from his back.yooyoo"And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?" shouted theyooassistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and moreyooaggrieved. "You are told to come at nine, and now it's twelve!"yooyoo"The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago," Raskolnikovyooanswered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grewyoosuddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. "And it's enough thatyooI have come here ill with fever."yooyoo"Kindly refrain from shouting!"yooyoo"I'm not shouting, I'm speaking very quietly, it's you who are shoutingyooat me. I'm a student, and allow no one to shout at me."yooyooThe assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute heyoocould only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.yooyoo"Be silent! You are in a government office. Don't be impudent, sir!"yooyoo"You're in a government office, too," cried Raskolnikov, "and you'reyoosmoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespectyooto all of us."yooyooHe felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.yooyooThe head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistantyoosuperintendent was obviously disconcerted.yooyoo"That's not your business!" he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.yoo"Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. AlexandryooGrigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don't pay youryoodebts! You're a fine bird!"yooyooBut Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at theyoopaper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a secondyootime, and still did not understand.yooyoo"What is this?" he asked the head clerk.yooyoo"It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You mustyooeither pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a writtenyoodeclaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking notyooto leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal youryooproperty. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceedyooagainst you according to the law."yooyoo"But I... am not in debt to anyone!"yooyoo"That's not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteenyooroubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought usyoofor recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nineyoomonths ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.yooWe therefore summon you, hereupon."yooyoo"But she is my landlady!"yooyoo"And what if she is your landlady?"yooyooThe head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,yooand at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fireyoofor the first time--as though he would say: "Well, how do you feel now?"yooBut what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was thatyooworth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, heyooread, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, butyooall mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance fromyoooverwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that momentyoowithout thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositionsyooor surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instantyooof full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very momentyoosomething like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistantyoosuperintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov's disrespect, still fumingyooand obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on theyoounfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came inyoowith an exceedingly silly smile.yooyoo"You shameful hussy!" he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (Theyoolady in mourning had left the office.) "What was going on at your houseyoolast night? Eh! A disgrace again, you're a scandal to the whole street.yooFighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,yooI have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off theyooeleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!"yooyooThe paper fell out of Raskolnikov's hands, and he looked wildly at theyoosmart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what ityoomeant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. Heyoolistened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all hisyoonerves were on edge.yooyoo"Ilya Petrovitch!" the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stoppedyooshort, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could notyoobe stopped except by force.yooyooAs for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before theyoostorm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms ofyooabuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive theyoosmiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, andyoocurtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in heryooword: and at last she found it.yooyoo"There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain," sheyoopattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,yoothough with a strong German accent, "and no sort of scandal, and hisyoohonour came drunk, and it's the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,yooand I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,yooand honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike anyyooscandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottlesyooagain, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforteyoowith one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, andyoohe _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I saidyooso. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And thenyooI called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in theyooeye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on theyoocheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,yooand I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood inyoothe window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea ofyoosquealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!yooAnd Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,yooMr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_yoopay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, fiveyooroubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and causedyooall the scandal. 'I will show you up,' he said, 'for I can write to allyoothe papers about you.'"yooyoo"Then he was an author?"yooyoo"Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourableyoohouse...."yooyoo"Now then! Enough! I have told you already..."yooyoo"Ilya Petrovitch!" the head clerk repeated significantly.yooyooThe assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook hisyoohead.yooyoo"... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell ityooyou for the last time," the assistant went on. "If there is a scandalyooin your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in theyoolock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literaryyooman, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an 'honourableyoohouse'? A nice set, these authors!"yooyooAnd he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. "There was a scandalyoothe other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner andyoowould not pay; 'I'll write a satire on you,' says he. And there wasyooanother of them on a steamer last week used the most disgracefulyoolanguage to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife andyoodaughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner's shopyoothe other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,yootown-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself oneyooday. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?"yooyooWith hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in allyoodirections, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, sheyoostumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, openyooface and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent ofyoothe district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made hasteyooto curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, sheyoofluttered out of the office.yooyoo"Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!" said Nikodim Fomitch to IlyayooPetrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. "You are aroused again, you areyoofuming again! I heard it on the stairs!"yooyoo"Well, what then!" Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;yooand he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing ofyoohis shoulders at each step. "Here, if you will kindly look: an author,yooor a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has givenyooan I O U, won't clear out of his room, and complaints are constantlyyoobeing lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protestyooagainst my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, andyoojust look at him, please. Here's the gentleman, and very attractive heyoois!"yooyoo"Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,yooyou can't bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something andyoowent too far yourself," continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably toyooRaskolnikov. "But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assureyooyou, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and noyoostopping him! And then it's all over! And at the bottom he's a heart ofyoogold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant...."yooyoo"And what a regiment it was, too," cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratifiedyooat this agreeable banter, though still sulky.yooyooRaskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasantyooto them all. "Excuse me, Captain," he began easily, suddenly addressingyooNikodim Fomitch, "will you enter into my position?... I am ready toyooask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sickyooand shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am notyoostudying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... Iyoohave a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it toyoome, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is soyooexasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for theyoolast four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and Iyoodon't understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on thisyooI O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!..."yooyoo"But that is not our business, you know," the head clerk was observing.yooyoo"Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain..."yooRaskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but tryingyoohis best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistentlyyooappeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuouslyyoooblivious of him. "Allow me to explain that I have been living with heryoofor nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I notyooconfess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, ityoowas a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I likedyooher, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...yoothat is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in thoseyoodays, and I led a life of... I was very heedless..."yooyoo"Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we've no time toyoowaste," Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;yoobut Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found ityooexceedingly difficult to speak.yooyoo"But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it allyoohappened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.yooBut a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there asyoobefore, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she saidyooto me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,yoobut still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteenyooroubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,yooshe would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,yoonever--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could payyooof myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing toyooeat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?"yooyoo"All these affecting details are no business of ours." Ilya Petrovitchyoointerrupted rudely. "You must give a written undertaking but as for youryoolove affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do withyoothat."yooyoo"Come now... you are harsh," muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down atyoothe table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.yooyoo"Write!" said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Write what?" the latter asked, gruffly.yooyoo"I will dictate to you."yooyooRaskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually andyoocontemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly feltyoocompletely indifferent to anyone's opinion, and this revulsion tookyooplace in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,yoohe would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them likeyoothat a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where hadyoothose feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, notyoowith police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, heyoowould not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. Ayoogloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, tookyooconscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimentalyooeffusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter'syootriumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.yooOh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these pettyyoovanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had beenyoosentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, wouldyoohardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening toyoohim entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, butyoohe felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he couldyoonever more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimentalyooeffusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and thatyooif they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,yooit would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in anyyoocircumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awfulyoosensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than ayooconception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all theyoosensations he had known in his life.yooyooThe head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,yoothat he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, thatyoohe would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.yooyoo"But you can't write, you can hardly hold the pen," observed the headyooclerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. "Are you ill?"yooyoo"Yes, I am giddy. Go on!"yooyoo"That's all. Sign it."yooyooThe head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.yooyooRaskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,yoohe put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. Heyoofelt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange ideayoosuddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to NikodimyooFomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and thenyooto go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the holeyooin the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seatyooto carry it out. "Hadn't I better think a minute?" flashed through hisyoomind. "No, better cast off the burden without thinking." But all at onceyoohe stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerlyyoowith Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:yooyoo"It's impossible, they'll both be released. To begin with, the wholeyoostory contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if ityoohad been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,yoothat would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen atyoothe gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walkingyoowith three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked theyooporters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would heyoohave asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As foryooKoch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith's below, before he wentyooup to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Nowyoojust consider..."yooyoo"But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They stateyoothemselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutesyoolater when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door wasyoounfastened."yooyoo"That's just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himselfyooin; and they'd have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not beenyooan ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized theyoointerval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossingyoohimself and saying: 'If I had been there, he would have jumped out andyookilled me with his axe.' He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,yooha!"yooyoo"And no one saw the murderer?"yooyoo"They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah's Ark," saidyoothe head clerk, who was listening.yooyoo"It's clear, quite clear," Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.yooyoo"No, it is anything but clear," Ilya Petrovitch maintained.yooyooRaskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he didyoonot reach it....yooyooWhen he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,yoosupported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standingyooon the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, andyooNikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got upyoofrom the chair.yooyoo"What's this? Are you ill?" Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.yooyoo"He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing," said the head clerk,yoosettling back in his place, and taking up his work again.yooyoo"Have you been ill long?" cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, whereyoohe, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look atyoothe sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.yooyoo"Since yesterday," muttered Raskolnikov in reply.yooyoo"Did you go out yesterday?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"Though you were ill?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"At what time?"yooyoo"About seven."yooyoo"And where did you go, my I ask?"yooyoo"Along the street."yooyoo"Short and clear."yooyooRaskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,yoowithout dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch's stare.yooyoo"He can scarcely stand upright. And you..." Nikodim Fomitch wasyoobeginning.yooyoo"No matter," Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.yooyooNikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing atyoothe head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. Thereyoowas a sudden silence. It was strange.yooyoo"Very well, then," concluded Ilya Petrovitch, "we will not detain you."yooyooRaskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on hisyoodeparture, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of NikodimyooFomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.yooyoo"A search--there will be a search at once," he repeated to himself,yoohurrying home. "The brutes! they suspect."yooyooHis former terror mastered him completely again.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIyooyoo"And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in myyooroom?"yooyooBut here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.yooEven Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have leftyooall those things in the hole?yooyooHe rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled theyoothings out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles inyooall: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardlyyoolooked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,yoomerely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that lookedyoolike a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of hisyooovercoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to concealyoothem as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out ofyoohis room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, andyoothough he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid ofyoopursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of anyoohour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so atyooall costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everythingyooup while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....yooWhere was he to go?yooyooThat had long been settled: "Fling them into the canal, and all tracesyoohidden in the water, the thing would be at an end." So he had decided inyoothe night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse toyooget up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to getyoorid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered alongyoothe bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and lookedyooseveral times at the steps running down to the water, but he could notyoothink of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps' edge,yooand women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, andyoopeople were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticedyoofrom the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to goyoodown on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what ifyoothe boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.yooEven as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as ifyoothey had nothing to do but to watch him. "Why is it, or can it be myyoofancy?" he thought.yooyooAt last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to theyooNeva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,yooand it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was furtheryoooff. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,yooworried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of ityoobefore. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simplyyoobecause he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absentyooand forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.yooyooHe walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the wayyooanother idea struck him. "Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to goyoosomewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the thingsyooin some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spotyooperhaps?" And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the ideayooseemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. Foryoocoming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left ayoopassage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the rightyoohand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched faryoointo the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it foryootwenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Hereyoowas a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts wasyoolying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,yooapparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. Ityoowas probably a carriage builder's or carpenter's shed; the whole placeyoofrom the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place toyoothrow it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, andyooat once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards whereyoothere are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above hadyoobeen scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, "Standing hereyoostrictly forbidden." This was all the better, for there would be nothingyoosuspicious about his going in. "Here I could throw it all in a heap andyooget away!"yooyooLooking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticedyooagainst the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewnyoostone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was ayoostreet. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but heyoocould not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from theyoostreet, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.yooyooHe bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,yooand using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a smallyoohollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.yooThe purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then heyooseized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it wasyooin the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. Butyoohe scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.yooNothing could be noticed.yooyooThen he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,yooalmost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had inyoothe police-office. "I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think ofyoolooking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever sinceyoothe house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it wereyoofound, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!" And he laughed.yooYes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiselessyoolaugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. Butyoowhen he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had comeyooupon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into hisyoomind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seatyooon which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that ityoowould be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he hadyoogiven the twenty copecks: "Damn him!"yooyooHe walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas nowyooseemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that thereyooreally was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing thatyoopoint--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.yooyoo"Damn it all!" he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.yoo"If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, howyoostupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawnedyooupon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do Iyoocare for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! Ityoois not that at all!"yooyooSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simpleyooquestion perplexed and bitterly confounded him.yooyoo"If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, ifyooI really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not evenyooglance into the purse and don't know what I had there, for which I haveyooundergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,yoofilthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into theyoowater the purse together with all the things which I had not seenyooeither... how's that?"yooyooYes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, andyooit was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the nightyoowithout hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as thoughyooit could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, andyoounderstood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at theyoomoment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases outyooof it.... Yes, so it was.yooyoo"It is because I am very ill," he decided grimly at last, "I have beenyooworrying and fretting myself, and I don't know what I am doing....yooYesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have beenyooworrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But whatyooif I don't get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!"yooyooHe walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for someyoodistraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A newyoooverwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over himyooevery moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion foryooeverything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.yooAll who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, theiryoomovements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that heyoomight have spat at him or bitten him....yooyooHe stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, nearyoothe bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. "Why, he lives here, in that house,"yoohe thought, "why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Hereyooit's the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;yoohave I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Neveryoomind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him theyooday _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go furtheryoonow."yooyooHe went up to Razumihin's room on the fifth floor.yooyooThe latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, andyoohe opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen eachyooother. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers onyoohis bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.yooyoo"Is it you?" he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after ayoobrief pause, he whistled. "As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you'veyoocut me out!" he added, looking at Raskolnikov's rags. "Come sit down,yooyou are tired, I'll be bound."yooyooAnd when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which wasyooin even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that hisyoovisitor was ill.yooyoo"Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?" He began feeling hisyoopulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.yooyoo"Never mind," he said, "I have come for this: I have no lessons.... Iyoowanted,... but I don't really want lessons...."yooyoo"But I say! You are delirious, you know!" Razumihin observed, watchingyoohim carefully.yooyoo"No, I am not."yooyooRaskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs toyooRazumihin's, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friendyooface to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of allyoodisposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in theyoowide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage atyoohimself as soon as he crossed Razumihin's threshold.yooyoo"Good-bye," he said abruptly, and walked to the door.yooyoo"Stop, stop! You queer fish."yooyoo"I don't want to," said the other, again pulling away his hand.yooyoo"Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, thisyoois... almost insulting! I won't let you go like that."yooyoo"Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who couldyoohelp... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, Iyoomean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?yooNothing at all... no one's services... no one's sympathy. I am byyoomyself... alone. Come, that's enough. Leave me alone."yooyoo"Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for allyooI care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don't care about that, butyoothere's a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.yooI would not exchange him for five lessons. He's doing publishing of ayookind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation theyyoohave! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that Iyoowas a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!yooNow he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling ofyooanything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures ofyoothe German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discussesyoothe question, 'Is woman a human being?' And, of course, triumphantlyyooproves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as ayoocontribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expandyoothese two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeousyootitle half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! Heyoopays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roublesyoofor the job, and I've had six already in advance. When we have finishedyoothis, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some ofyoothe dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we haveyoomarked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau wasyooa kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don't contradict him, hang him!yooWell, would you like to do the second signature of '_Is woman a humanyoobeing?_' If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all thoseyooare provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles inyooadvance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.yooAnd when you have finished the signature there will be another threeyooroubles for you. And please don't think I am doing you a service; quiteyoothe contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; toyoobegin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterlyyooadrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.yooThe only comfort is, that it's bound to be a change for the better.yooThough who can tell, maybe it's sometimes for the worse. Will you takeyooit?"yooyooRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roublesyooand without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.yooBut when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted theyoostairs to Razumihin's again and laying on the table the German articleyooand the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.yooyoo"Are you raving, or what?" Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.yoo"What farce is this? You'll drive me crazy too... what did you come toyoosee me for, damn you?"yooyoo"I don't want... translation," muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.yooyoo"Then what the devil do you want?" shouted Razumihin from above.yooRaskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.yooyoo"Hey, there! Where are you living?"yooyooNo answer.yooyoo"Well, confound you then!"yooyooBut Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the NikolaevskyyooBridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasantyooincident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave himyooa violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen underyoohis horses' hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to theyoorailing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middleyooof the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.yooHe heard laughter, of course.yooyoo"Serves him right!"yooyoo"A pickpocket I dare say."yooyoo"Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels onyoopurpose; and you have to answer for him."yooyoo"It's a regular profession, that's what it is."yooyooBut while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewilderedyooafter the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly feltyoosomeone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly womanyooin a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughteryoowearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.yooyoo"Take it, my good man, in Christ's name."yooyooHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. Fromyoohis dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggaryooasking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks heyoodoubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.yooyooHe closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, andyooturned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was withoutyooa cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in theyooNeva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from theyoobridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,yooand in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.yooThe pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; oneyoouneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stoodyoostill, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot wasyooespecially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he hadyoohundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,yoogazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled atyooa vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangelyyoocold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wonderedyooevery time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrustingyoohimself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalledyoothose old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it wasyoono mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange andyoogrotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,yooas though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, beyoointerested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...yooso short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung hisyooheart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to himyoonow--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,yoohis old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... Heyoofelt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishingyoofrom his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, heyoosuddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened hisyoohand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it intoyoothe water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cutyoohimself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.yooyooEvening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have beenyoowalking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.yooUndressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on theyoosofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....yooyooIt was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what ayooscream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,yooblows and curses he had never heard.yooyooHe could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror heyoosat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailingyooand cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazementyoohe caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking andyoowailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not makeyooout what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to beyoobeaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice ofyooher assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almostyooa croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quicklyyooand indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikovyootrembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.yooIlya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,yoobanging her head against the steps--that's clear, that can be toldyoofrom the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the worldyootopsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeysyooand all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doorsyoobanging. "But why, why, and how could it be?" he repeated, thinkingyooseriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! Andyoothey would come to him then next, "for no doubt... it's all aboutyoothat... about yesterday.... Good God!" He would have fastened his dooryoowith the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it wouldyoobe useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbedyoohim.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,yoobegan gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; IlyayooPetrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,yootoo, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. "Can he haveyoogone away? Good Lord!" Yes, and now the landlady is going too, stillyooweeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd wasyoogoing from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, callingyooto one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to ayoowhisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmatesyooof the block. "But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he comeyoohere!"yooyooRaskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. Heyoolay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation ofyooinfinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a brightyoolight flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plateyooof soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was notyooasleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what sheyoohad brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.yooyoo"You've eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You've been trudgingyooabout all day, and you're shaking with fever."yooyoo"Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?"yooyooShe looked intently at him.yooyoo"Who beat the landlady?"yooyoo"Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistantyoosuperintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,yooand... why was he here?"yooyooNastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted ayoolong time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.yooyoo"Nastasya, why don't you speak?" he said timidly at last in a weakyoovoice.yooyoo"It's the blood," she answered at last softly, as though speaking toyooherself.yooyoo"Blood? What blood?" he muttered, growing white and turning towards theyoowall.yooyooNastasya still looked at him without speaking.yooyoo"Nobody has been beating the landlady," she declared at last in a firm,yooresolute voice.yooyooHe gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.yooyoo"I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up," heyoosaid still more timidly. "I listened a long while. The assistantyoosuperintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all theyooflats."yooyoo"No one has been here. That's the blood crying in your ears. Whenyoothere's no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancyingyoothings.... Will you eat something?"yooyooHe made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.yooyoo"Give me something to drink... Nastasya."yooyooShe went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.yooHe remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spillingyoosome on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIIyooyooHe was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; heyoowas in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.yooHe remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as thoughyoothere were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him awayyoosomewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing aboutyoohim. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraidyooof him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;yoothey threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mockedyooat him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguishedyooanother person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he couldyoonot remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.yooSometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other timesyooit all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he hadyoono recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgottenyoosomething he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself tryingyooto remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerableyooterror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someoneyooalways prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence andyooforgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.yooyooIt happened at ten o'clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shoneyoointo the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the rightyoowall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside himyoowith another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at himyoovery inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,yooshort-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady wasyoopeeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.yooyoo"Who is this, Nastasya?" he asked, pointing to the young man.yooyoo"I say, he's himself again!" she said.yooyoo"He is himself," echoed the man.yooyooConcluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed theyoodoor and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations oryoodiscussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fatyooand buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness andyoolaziness, and absurdly bashful.yooyoo"Who... are you?" he went on, addressing the man. But at that momentyoothe door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,yooRazumihin came in.yooyoo"What a cabin it is!" he cried. "I am always knocking my head. You callyoothis a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I've just heard the newsyoofrom Pashenka."yooyoo"He has just come to," said Nastasya.yooyoo"Just come to," echoed the man again, with a smile.yooyoo"And who are you?" Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. "My name isyooVrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, butyooVrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who areyooyou?"yooyoo"I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, andyooI've come on business."yooyoo"Please sit down." Razumihin seated himself on the other side of theyootable. "It's a good thing you've come to, brother," he went on toyooRaskolnikov. "For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunkyooanything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to seeyooyou twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said atyooonce it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.yooSome nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have notyoohad enough beer and radish, but it's nothing much, it will pass and youyoowill be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite ayooname. Come, I won't keep you," he said, addressing the man again. "Willyooyou explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second timeyoothey have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and Iyootalked to him. Who was it came before?"yooyoo"That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,yoosir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too."yooyoo"He was more intelligent than you, don't you think so?"yooyoo"Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am."yooyoo"Quite so; go on."yooyoo"At your mamma's request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whomyooI presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to youyoofrom our office," the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. "If you are inyooan intelligible condition, I've thirty-five roubles to remit to you, asyooSemyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma'syoorequest instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do youyooknow him, sir?"yooyoo"Yes, I remember... Vahrushin," Raskolnikov said dreamily.yooyoo"You hear, he knows Vahrushin," cried Razumihin. "He is in 'anyoointelligible condition'! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,yooit's always pleasant to hear words of wisdom."yooyoo"That's the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the requestyooof your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in theyoosame manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sentyooinstructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand youyoothirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come."yooyoo"That 'hoping for better to come' is the best thing you've said, thoughyoo'your mamma' is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fullyyooconscious, eh?"yooyoo"That's all right. If only he can sign this little paper."yooyoo"He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?"yooyoo"Yes, here's the book."yooyoo"Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I'll hold you. Take the pen andyooscribble 'Raskolnikov' for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeteryooto us than treacle."yooyoo"I don't want it," said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.yooyoo"Not want it?"yooyoo"I won't sign it."yooyoo"How the devil can you do without signing it?"yooyoo"I don't want... the money."yooyoo"Don't want the money! Come, brother, that's nonsense, I bear witness.yooDon't trouble, please, it's only that he is on his travels again. Butyoothat's pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man ofyoojudgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take hisyoohand and he will sign it. Here."yooyoo"But I can come another time."yooyoo"No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,yooRodya, don't keep your visitor, you see he is waiting," and he madeyooready to hold Raskolnikov's hand in earnest.yooyoo"Stop, I'll do it alone," said the latter, taking the pen and signingyoohis name.yooyooThe messenger took out the money and went away.yooyoo"Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?"yooyoo"Yes," answered Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Is there any soup?"yooyoo"Some of yesterday's," answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.yooyoo"With potatoes and rice in it?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea."yooyoo"Very well."yooyooRaskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,yoounreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see whatyoowould happen. "I believe I am not wandering. I believe it's reality," heyoothought.yooyooIn a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announcedyoothat the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought twoyoospoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. Theyootable was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.yooyoo"It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send usyooup a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them."yooyoo"Well, you are a cool hand," muttered Nastasya, and she departed toyoocarry out his orders.yooyooRaskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. MeanwhileyooRazumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put hisyooleft arm round Raskolnikov's head, although he was able to sit up, andyoowith his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it thatyooit might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikovyooswallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But afteryoogiving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, andyoosaid that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.yooyooNastasya came in with two bottles of beer.yooyoo"And will you have tea?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture onyoowithout the faculty. But here is the beer!" He moved back to his chair,yoopulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though heyoohad not touched food for three days.yooyoo"I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now," heyoomumbled with his mouth full of beef, "and it's all Pashenka, your dearyoolittle landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. Iyoodon't ask for it, but, of course, I don't object. And here's Nastasyayoowith the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won't you haveyoosome beer?"yooyoo"Get along with your nonsense!"yooyoo"A cup of tea, then?"yooyoo"A cup of tea, maybe."yooyoo"Pour it out. Stay, I'll pour it out myself. Sit down."yooyooHe poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. Asyoobefore, he put his left arm round the sick man's head, raised him upyooand gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily andyooearnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effectiveyoomeans towards his friend's recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and madeyoono resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofayoowithout support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, butyooeven perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almostyooanimal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lyingyoolow for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possessionyooof his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.yooYet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozenyoospoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon awayyoocapriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually realyoopillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observedyoothat, too, and took note of it.yooyoo"Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him someyooraspberry tea," said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attackingyoohis soup and beer again.yooyoo"And where is she to get raspberries for you?" asked Nastasya, balancingyooa saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump ofyoosugar.yooyoo"She'll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of thingsyoohave been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped inyoothat rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that Iyooresolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.yooHow I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I hadyooforgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not knowyooit; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at theyooFive Corners, Harlamov's house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov'syoohouse, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov's, butyooBuch's. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and Iyoowent on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, inyootwo minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there."yooyoo"My name!"yooyoo"I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find whileyooI was there. Well, it's a long story. But as soon as I did land on thisyooplace, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I knowyooeverything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance ofyooNikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.yooZametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,yooand, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows...."yooyoo"He's got round her," Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.yooyoo"Why don't you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?"yooyoo"You are a one!" Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. "I amyoonot Nikiforovna, but Petrovna," she added suddenly, recovering from heryoomirth.yooyoo"I'll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,yooI was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignantyooinfluences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had notyooexpected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do youyoothink?"yooyooRaskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,yoofull of alarm.yooyoo"And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect," Razumihin wentyooon, not at all embarrassed by his silence.yooyoo"Ah, the sly dog!" Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation affordedyooher unspeakable delight.yooyoo"It's a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right wayyooat first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, soyooto speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about heryoocharacter later.... How could you let things come to such a pass thatyooshe gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have beenyoomad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,yooNatalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that'syooa delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking ofyoofoolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish asyooyou would think at first sight?"yooyoo"No," mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was betteryooto keep up the conversation.yooyoo"She isn't, is she?" cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer outyooof him. "But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,yooessentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,yooI assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, andyooof course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge heryoointellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is ayoosort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!yooI don't understand it! Well, that's all nonsense. Only, seeing that youyooare not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, andyoothat through the young lady's death she has no need to treat you asyooa relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den andyoodropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.yooAnd she's been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to loseyoothe I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay."yooyoo"It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almostyooa beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,"yooRaskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.yooyoo"Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that pointyooMr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never haveyoothought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; butyoothe business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts theyooquestion, 'Is there any hope of realising the I O U?' Answer: there is,yoobecause he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred andyootwenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,yootoo, who would go into bondage for his sake. That's what he was buildingyooupon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairsyoonow, my dear boy--it's not for nothing that you were so open withyooPashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this asyooa friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man isyooopen; and a business man 'listens and goes on eating' you up. Well,yoothen she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and withoutyoohesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all thisyooI wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that timeyooharmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stoppingyoothe whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,yoobrother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him tenyooroubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour ofyoopresenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see Iyoohave torn it."yooyooRazumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him andyooturned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt ayootwinge.yooyoo"I see, brother," he said a moment later, "that I have been playing theyoofool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believeyooI have only made you cross."yooyoo"Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?" Raskolnikovyooasked, after a moment's pause without turning his head.yooyoo"Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I broughtyooZametov one day."yooyoo"Zametov? The head clerk? What for?" Raskolnikov turned round quicklyyooand fixed his eyes on Razumihin.yooyoo"What's the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted toyoomake your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... Howyoocould I have found out so much except from him? He is a capitalyoofellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we areyoofriends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,yooyou know. I have only just moved. I've been with him to Luise Ivanovnayooonce or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?yooyoo"Did I say anything in delirium?"yooyoo"I should think so! You were beside yourself."yooyoo"What did I rave about?"yooyoo"What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,yoobrother, now I must not lose time. To work." He got up from the tableyooand took up his cap.yooyoo"What did I rave about?"yooyoo"How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don'tyooworry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lotyooabout a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about KrestovskyyooIsland, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, theyooassistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interestyooto you was your own sock. You whined, 'Give me my sock.' Zametovyoohunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,yooring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were youyoocomforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretchedyoothing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likelyyoosomewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked soyoopiteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sortyooof fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here areyoothirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an accountyooof them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,yoothough he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. Andyooyou, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether heyoowants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wantedyoomyself. Good-bye!"yooyoo"He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he's a deep one!" said Nastasya as he wentyooout; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resistyoorunning downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he wouldyoosay to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.yooyooNo sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off theyoobedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitchingyooimpatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set toyoowork. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.yooyoo"Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? Whatyooif they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,yooand then they will come in and tell me that it's been discovered longyooago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That's what I'veyooforgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I rememberedyooa minute ago."yooyooHe stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewildermentyooabout him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was notyoowhat he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed toyoothe corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,yooput his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to theyoostove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges ofyoohis trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just asyoohe had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sockyooabout which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay onyoothe sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime thatyooZametov could not have seen anything on it.yooyoo"Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the policeyoooffice? Where's the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. Iyoolooked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. Butyoowhat did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?" he muttered,yoohelplessly sitting on the sofa again. "What does it mean? Am I still inyoodelirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I mustyooescape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... butyoowhere? And where are my clothes? I've no boots. They've taken them away!yooThey've hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed thatyooover! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here's the I O U...yooI'll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won't findyoome!... Yes, but the address bureau? They'll find me, Razumihin will findyoome. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let themyoodo their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... Whatyooelse shall I take? They think I am ill! They don't know that I can walk,yooha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! Ifyooonly I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watchyoothere--policemen! What's this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half ayoobottle, cold!"yooyooHe snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, andyoogulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.yooBut in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint andyooeven pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled theyooquilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and moreyoodisconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. Withyooa sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped moreyooclosely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,yooragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshingyoosleep.yooyooHe woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and sawyooRazumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in oryoonot. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as thoughyootrying to recall something.yooyoo"Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!"yooRazumihin shouted down the stairs. "You shall have the accountyoodirectly."yooyoo"What time is it?" asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.yooyoo"Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it's almost evening, it will be sixyooo'clock directly. You have slept more than six hours."yooyoo"Good heavens! Have I?"yooyoo"And why not? It will do you good. What's the hurry? A tryst, is it?yooWe've all time before us. I've been waiting for the last three hours foryooyou; I've been up twice and found you asleep. I've called on Zossimovyootwice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. AndyooI've been out on my own business, too. You know I've been moving to-day,yoomoving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that'syoono matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open ityoodirectly. And how do you feel now, brother?"yooyoo"I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?"yooyoo"I tell you I've been waiting for the last three hours."yooyoo"No, before."yooyoo"How do you mean?"yooyoo"How long have you been coming here?"yooyoo"Why I told you all about it this morning. Don't you remember?"yooyooRaskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He couldyoonot remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.yooyoo"Hm!" said the latter, "he has forgotten. I fancied then that you wereyoonot quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You reallyyoolook much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dearyooboy."yooyooHe began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.yooyoo"Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For weyoomust make a man of you. Let's begin from the top. Do you see thisyoocap?" he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap andyooordinary cap. "Let me try it on."yooyoo"Presently, afterwards," said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.yooyoo"Come, Rodya, my boy, don't oppose it, afterwards will be too late; andyooI shan't sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.yooJust right!" he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, "just your size! Ayooproper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation inyooits own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take offyoohis pudding basin when he goes into any public place where otheryoopeople wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavishyoopoliteness, but it's simply because he is ashamed of his bird's nest;yoohe is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens ofyooheadgear: this Palmerston"--he took from the corner Raskolnikov's old,yoobattered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--"oryoothis jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,yooNastasya!" he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did notyoospeak.yooyoo"Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say," answered Nastasya.yooyoo"Twenty copecks, silly!" he cried, offended. "Why, nowadays you wouldyoocost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has beenyooworn. And it's bought on condition that when's it's worn out, they willyoogive you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass toyoothe United States of America, as they called them at school. I assureyooyou I am proud of these breeches," and he exhibited to Raskolnikov ayoopair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. "No holes, noyoospots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoatyooto match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is anyooimprovement, it's softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,yoothe great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to theyooseasons; if you don't insist on having asparagus in January, you keepyooyour money in your purse; and it's the same with this purchase. It'syoosummer now, so I've been buying summer things--warmer materials will beyoowanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...yooespecially as they will be done for by then from their own lack ofyoocoherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! Whatyoodo you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:yooif you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They onlyyoodo business on that system at Fedyaev's; if you've bought a thing once,yooyou are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of youryooown free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they areyooa bit worn, but they'll last a couple of months, for it's foreign workyooand foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them lastyooweek--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.yooPrice--a rouble and a half. A bargain?"yooyoo"But perhaps they won't fit," observed Nastasya.yooyoo"Not fit? Just look!" and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov'syooold, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. "I did not goyooempty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.yooAnd as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to beginyoowith are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Wellyoonow then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks theyoosuit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for theyooboots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roublesyoofifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they wereyoobought in the lo--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.yooForty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,yooyou are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat willyooserve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one'syooclothes from Sharmer's! As for your socks and other things, I leave themyooto you; we've twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and payingyoofor your lodging, don't you worry. I tell you she'll trust you foryooanything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay youyoowill throw off your illness with your shirt."yooyoo"Let me be! I don't want to!" Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listenedyoowith disgust to Razumihin's efforts to be playful about his purchases.yooyoo"Come, brother, don't tell me I've been trudging around for nothing,"yooRazumihin insisted. "Nastasya, don't be bashful, but help me--that'syooit," and in spite of Raskolnikov's resistance he changed his linen. Theyoolatter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.yooyoo"It will be long before I get rid of them," he thought. "What money wasyooall that bought with?" he asked at last, gazing at the wall.yooyoo"Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, youryoomother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?"yooyoo"I remember now," said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.yooRazumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.yooyooThe door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiaryooto Raskolnikov came in.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IVyooyooZossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven faceyooand straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring onyoohis fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionableyooloose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,yoofashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, hisyoowatch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,yoononchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he madeyooefforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at everyyooinstant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was cleveryooat his work.yooyoo"I've been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he's come to himself,"yoocried Razumihin.yooyoo"I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?" said Zossimov toyooRaskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of theyoosofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.yooyoo"He is still depressed," Razumihin went on. "We've just changed hisyoolinen and he almost cried."yooyoo"That's very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wishyooit.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?"yooyoo"I am well, I am perfectly well!" Raskolnikov declared positivelyyooand irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them withyooglittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned toyoothe wall. Zossimov watched him intently.yooyoo"Very good.... Going on all right," he said lazily. "Has he eatenyooanything?"yooyooThey told him, and asked what he might have.yooyoo"He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, ofyoocourse, you must not give him; he'd better not have meat either, and...yoobut no need to tell you that!" Razumihin and he looked at eachyooother. "No more medicine or anything. I'll look at him again to-morrow.yooPerhaps, to-day even... but never mind..."yooyoo"To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk," said Razumihin. "We areyoogoing to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Crystal."yooyoo"I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don't know... a little,yoomaybe... but we'll see."yooyoo"Ach, what a nuisance! I've got a house-warming party to-night; it'syooonly a step from here. Couldn't he come? He could lie on the sofa. Youyooare coming?" Razumihin said to Zossimov. "Don't forget, you promised."yooyoo"All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?"yooyoo"Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just ouryoofriends."yooyoo"And who?"yooyoo"All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, andyoohe is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to someyoobusiness of his. We meet once in five years."yooyoo"What is he?"yooyoo"He's been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets ayoolittle pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But Iyooam fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the InvestigationyooDepartment here... But you know him."yooyoo"Is he a relation of yours, too?"yooyoo"A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelledyooonce, won't you come then?"yooyoo"I don't care a damn for him."yooyoo"So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, ayoogovernment clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov."yooyoo"Do tell me, please, what you or he"--Zossimov nodded atyooRaskolnikov--"can have in common with this Zametov?"yooyoo"Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,yooas it were by springs; you won't venture to turn round on your ownyooaccount. If a man is a nice fellow, that's the only principle I go upon.yooZametov is a delightful person."yooyoo"Though he does take bribes."yooyoo"Well, he does! and what of it? I don't care if he does take bribes,"yooRazumihin cried with unnatural irritability. "I don't praise him foryootaking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if oneyoolooks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sureyooI shouldn't be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrownyooin."yooyoo"That's too little; I'd give two for you."yooyoo"And I wouldn't give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!yooZametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw himyoonot repel him. You'll never improve a man by repelling him, especiallyyooa boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressiveyoodullards! You don't understand. You harm yourselves running another manyoodown.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common."yooyoo"I should like to know what."yooyoo"Why, it's all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out ofyooa mess! Though indeed there's nothing to fear now. The matter isyooabsolutely self-evident. We only put on steam."yooyoo"A painter?"yooyoo"Why, haven't I told you about it? I only told you the beginning thenyooabout the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixedyooup in it..."yooyoo"Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...yoopartly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers, too...."yooyoo"Lizaveta was murdered, too," Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressingyooRaskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the dooryoolistening.yooyoo"Lizaveta," murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.yooyoo"Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn't you know her? She used to comeyoohere. She mended a shirt for you, too."yooyooRaskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper heyoopicked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and beganyooexamining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in theyoopetals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifelessyooas though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but staredyooobstinately at the flower.yooyoo"But what about the painter?" Zossimov interrupted Nastasya's chatteryoowith marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.yooyoo"Why, he was accused of the murder," Razumihin went on hotly.yooyoo"Was there evidence against him then?"yooyoo"Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that's what weyoohave to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch andyooPestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it's all done, it makes oneyoosick, though it's not one's business! Pestryakov may be comingyooto-night.... By the way, Rodya, you've heard about the business already;yooit happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at theyoopolice office while they were talking about it."yooyooZossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.yooyoo"But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!"yooZossimov observed.yooyoo"Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway," shouted Razumihin,yoobringing his fist down on the table. "What's the most offensive is notyootheir lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,yoofor it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worshipyootheir own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out atyoofirst? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porteryooit was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were theyoomurderers--that was their logic!"yooyoo"But don't excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could notyoohelp that.... And, by the way, I've met that man Koch. He used to buyyoounredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?"yooyoo"Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a professionyooof it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It's theiryoosickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the meansyooof introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological datayooalone how to get on the track of the real man. 'We have facts,' theyyoosay. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies inyoohow you interpret them!"yooyoo"Can you interpret them, then?"yooyoo"Anyway, one can't hold one's tongue when one has a feeling, a tangibleyoofeeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know theyoodetails of the case?"yooyoo"I am waiting to hear about the painter."yooyoo"Oh, yes! Well, here's the story. Early on the third day after theyoomurder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though theyyooaccounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--anyoounexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps ayoodram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller'syoocase containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. 'Theyooday before yesterday, just after eight o'clock'--mark the day and theyoohour!--'a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see meyooalready that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, andyooasked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he gotyoothem, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask himyooanything more.' I am telling you Dushkin's story. 'I gave him a note'--ayoorouble that is--'for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he wouldyoowith another. It would all come to the same thing--he'd spend it onyoodrink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide ityoothe quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear anyyoorumours, I'll take it to the police.' Of course, that's all taradiddle;yoohe lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker andyooa receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of ayoothirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simplyyooafraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin's story. 'I've knownyoothis peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the sameyooprovince and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men. And thoughyooNikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in thatyoohouse, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.yooAs soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,yootook his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.yooAnd the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna andyooher sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I feltyoosuspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered womanyoolent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make carefulyooinquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, "IsyooNikolay here?" Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; heyoohad come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,yooand went out again. Dmitri didn't see him again and is finishing theyoojob alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, onyoothe second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word toyooanyone'--that's Dushkin's tale--'but I found out what I could aboutyoothe murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eightyooo'clock this morning'--that was the third day, you understand--'I sawyooNikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he couldyoounderstand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did notyoospeak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleepyooon a bench and our two boys. "Have you seen Dmitri?" said I. "No, Iyoohaven't," said he. "And you've not been here either?" "Not since the dayyoobefore yesterday," said he. "And where did you sleep last night?"yoo"In Peski, with the Kolomensky men." "And where did you get thoseyooear-rings?" I asked. "I found them in the street," and the way he saidyooit was a bit queer; he did not look at me. "Did you hear what happenedyoothat very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?" said I.yoo"No," said he, "I had not heard," and all the while he was listening,yoohis eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. Iyootold him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wantedyooto keep him. "Wait a bit, Nikolay," said I, "won't you have a drink?"yooAnd I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind theyoobar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.yooI have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was hisyoodoing, as clear as could be....'"yooyoo"I should think so," said Zossimov.yooyoo"Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;yoothey detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;yoothe Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day beforeyooyesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. Heyoohad gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dramyoofor it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman wentyooto the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stableyooadjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on ayooblock of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The womanyooscreeched her hardest; people ran in. 'So that's what you are up to!'yoo'Take me,' he says, 'to such-and-such a police officer; I'll confessyooeverything.' Well, they took him to that police station--that isyoohere--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how oldyoohe is, 'twenty-two,' and so on. At the question, 'When you were workingyoowith Dmitri, didn't you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such ayootime?'--answer: 'To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I didyoonot notice them.' 'And didn't you hear anything, any noise, and so on?'yoo'We heard nothing special.' 'And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the sameyooday Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?' 'Iyoonever knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from AfanasyyooPavlovitch the day before yesterday.' 'And where did you find theyooear-rings?' 'I found them on the pavement.' 'Why didn't you go to workyoowith Dmitri the other day?' 'Because I was drinking.' 'And where wereyooyou drinking?' 'Oh, in such-and-such a place.' 'Why did you run awayyoofrom Dushkin's?' 'Because I was awfully frightened.' 'What wereyooyou frightened of?' 'That I should be accused.' 'How could you beyoofrightened, if you felt free from guilt?' Now, Zossimov, you may notyoobelieve me, that question was put literally in those words. I know ityoofor a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?"yooyoo"Well, anyway, there's the evidence."yooyoo"I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,yooof their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezedyoohim and he confessed: 'I did not find it in the street, but in the flatyoowhere I was painting with Dmitri.' 'And how was that?' 'Why, Dmitri andyooI were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, andyooDmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.yooI ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs Iyooran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemenyoowere there I don't remember. And the porter swore at me, and the otheryooporter swore, too, and the porter's wife came out, and swore at us, too;yooand a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,yootoo, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri'syoohair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caughtyoome by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temperyoobut in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran intoyoothe street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went backyooto the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting themyootogether, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in theyoocorner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrappedyooup in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,yooand in the box were the ear-rings....'"yooyoo"Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?" Raskolnikovyoocried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and heyooslowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.yooyoo"Yes... why? What's the matter? What's wrong?" Razumihin, too, got upyoofrom his seat.yooyoo"Nothing," Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All wereyoosilent for a while.yooyoo"He must have waked from a dream," Razumihin said at last, lookingyooinquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.yooyoo"Well, go on," said Zossimov. "What next?"yooyoo"What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri andyooeverything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, gotyooa rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, andyoowent off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:yoo'I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.'yoo'And why didn't you come to the police till now?' 'I was frightened.'yoo'And why did you try to hang yourself?' 'From anxiety.' 'What anxiety?'yoo'That I should be accused of it.' Well, that's the whole story. And nowyoowhat do you suppose they deduced from that?"yooyoo"Why, there's no supposing. There's a clue, such as it is, a fact. Youyoowouldn't have your painter set free?"yooyoo"Now they've simply taken him for the murderer. They haven't a shadow ofyoodoubt."yooyoo"That's nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? Youyoomust admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the oldyoowoman's box have come into Nikolay's hands, they must have come thereyoosomehow. That's a good deal in such a case."yooyoo"How did they get there? How did they get there?" cried Razumihin.yoo"How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has moreyooopportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you failyooto see the character of the man in the whole story? Don't you see atyooonce that the answers he has given in the examination are the holyyootruth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he steppedyooon the box and picked it up."yooyoo"The holy truth! But didn't he own himself that he told a lie at first?"yooyoo"Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakovyooand the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman whoyoowas sitting in the porter's lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just gotyooout of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on hisyooarm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri onyoothe ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to hisyoohair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking theyoothoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they 'like children'yoo(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,yoosquealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasingyooone another like children, they ran into the street. Now take carefulyoonote. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when theyyoofound them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken openyoothe boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you oneyooquestion: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childishyooscuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,yoorobbery? They'd just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, foryoothe bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowingyoothat people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, theyyoorolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.yooAnd there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!"yooyoo"Of course it is strange! It's impossible, indeed, but..."yooyoo"No, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay'syoohands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an importantyoopiece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanationyoogiven by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriouslyyooagainst him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove himyooinnocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. Andyoodo you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they willyooaccept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--restingyoosimply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusivelyyoobreaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, theyyoowon't accept it, they certainly won't, because they found the jewel-caseyooand the man tried to hang himself, 'which he could not have done if heyoohadn't felt guilty.' That's the point, that's what excites me, you mustyoounderstand!"yooyoo"Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proofyoois there that the box came from the old woman?"yooyoo"That's been proved," said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.yoo"Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, whoyooproved conclusively that it was his."yooyoo"That's bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the timeyoothat Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there noyooevidence about that?"yooyoo"Nobody did see him," Razumihin answered with vexation. "That's theyooworst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their wayyooupstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.yooThey said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work goingyooon in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whetheryoothere actually were men at work in it."yooyoo"Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beatingyooone another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...yooHow do you explain the facts yourself?"yooyoo"How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It's clear. At anyyoorate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, andyoothe jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.yooThe murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knockedyooat the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so theyoomurderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way ofyooescape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat whenyooNikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while theyooporter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out ofyoohearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitriyooand Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;yoopossibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people goingyooin and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket whenyoohe stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because heyoohad other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof thatyoohe did stand there.... That's how I explain it."yooyoo"Too clever! No, my boy, you're too clever. That beats everything."yooyoo"But, why, why?"yooyoo"Why, because everything fits too well... it's too melodramatic."yooyoo"A-ach!" Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door openedyooand a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VyooyooThis was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,yooand a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in theyoodoorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,yooas though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.yooMistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almostyooaffronted, he scanned Raskolnikov's low and narrow "cabin." With theyoosame amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,yoounwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then withyoothe same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure andyoounshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in theyooface without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for ayoocouple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shiftingyootook place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,yoothat he would get nothing in this "cabin" by attempting to overawe them,yoothe gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,yooemphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:yooyoo"Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?"yooyooZossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had notyooRazumihin anticipated him.yooyoo"Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?"yooyooThis familiar "what do you want" seemed to cut the ground from theyoofeet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checkedyoohimself in time and turned to Zossimov again.yooyoo"This is Raskolnikov," mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then heyoogave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then heyoolazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge goldyoowatch in a round hunter's case, opened it, looked at it and as slowlyyooand lazily proceeded to put it back.yooyooRaskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazingyoopersistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now thatyoohis face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, ityoowas extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had justyooundergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. Butyoothe new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,yoothen suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said "This is Raskolnikov"yoohe jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, butyooweak and breaking, voice articulated:yooyoo"Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?"yooyooThe visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:yooyoo"Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my nameyoois not wholly unknown to you?"yooyooBut Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazedyooblankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard theyooname of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.yooyoo"Is it possible that you can up to the present have received noyooinformation?" asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.yooyooIn reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his handsyoobehind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came intoyooLuzhin's face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitivelyyoothan ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.yooyoo"I had presumed and calculated," he faltered, "that a letter posted moreyoothan ten days, if not a fortnight ago..."yooyoo"I say, why are you standing in the doorway?" Razumihin interruptedyoosuddenly. "If you've something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are soyoocrowded. Nastasya, make room. Here's a chair, thread your way in!"yooyooHe moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between theyootable and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for theyoovisitor to "thread his way in." The minute was so chosen that it wasyooimpossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurryingyooand stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously atyooRazumihin.yooyoo"No need to be nervous," the latter blurted out. "Rodya has been ill foryoothe last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering andyoohas got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.yooI am a comrade of Rodya's, like him, formerly a student, and now I amyoonursing him; so don't you take any notice of us, but go on with youryoobusiness."yooyoo"Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence andyooconversation?" Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.yooyoo"N-no," mumbled Zossimov; "you may amuse him." He yawned again.yooyoo"He has been conscious a long time, since the morning," went onyooRazumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-natureyoothat Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,yoobecause this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as ayoostudent.yooyoo"Your mamma," began Luzhin.yooyoo"Hm!" Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at himyooinquiringly.yooyoo"That's all right, go on."yooyooLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.yooyoo"Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning inyooher neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days toyooelapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fullyyooassured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to myyooastonishment..."yooyoo"I know, I know!" Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.yoo"So you are the _fiancé_? I know, and that's enough!"yooyooThere was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch's being offended this time,yoobut he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it allyoomeant. There was a moment's silence.yooyooMeanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when heyooanswered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, asyoothough he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though somethingyoonew had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare atyoohim. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch's wholeyooappearance, something which seemed to justify the title of "fiancé" soyoounceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, faryootoo much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his fewyoodays in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectationyooof his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,yooindeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of theyooagreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in suchyoocircumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle ofyoofiancé. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor's and were allyooright, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Evenyoothe stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitchyootreated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. Theyooexquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,yooif only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them inyoohis hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in PyotryooPetrovitch's attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,yoolight thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, ayoocravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the bestyooof it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and evenyoohandsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.yooHis dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,yoogrowing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,yootouched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curledyooat a hairdresser's, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hairyoousually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.yooIf there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his ratheryoogood-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite otheryoocauses. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiledyoomalignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling asyoobefore.yooyooBut Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take noyoonotice of their oddities.yooyoo"I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation," he began,yooagain breaking the silence with an effort. "If I had been aware of youryooillness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. Iyoohave, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mentionyooother preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting youryoomamma and sister any minute."yooyooRaskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showedyoosome excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothingyoofollowed, he went on:yooyoo"... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival."yooyoo"Where?" asked Raskolnikov weakly.yooyoo"Very near here, in Bakaleyev's house."yooyoo"That's in Voskresensky," put in Razumihin. "There are two storeys ofyoorooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I've been there."yooyoo"Yes, rooms..."yooyoo"A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what's more, of doubtfulyoocharacter. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queeryoopeople living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It'syoocheap, though..."yooyoo"I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a strangeryooin Petersburg myself," Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. "However, theyootwo rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...yooI have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat," he said,yooaddressing Raskolnikov, "and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I amyoomyself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey SemyonovitchyooLebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told meyooof Bakaleyev's house, too..."yooyoo"Lebeziatnikov?" said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.yooyoo"Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do youyooknow him?"yooyoo"Yes... no," Raskolnikov answered.yooyoo"Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....yooA very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: oneyoolearns new things from them." Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.yooyoo"How do you mean?" asked Razumihin.yooyoo"In the most serious and essential matters," Pyotr Petrovitch replied,yooas though delighted at the question. "You see, it's ten years since Iyoovisited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us inyoothe provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.yooAnd it's my notion that you observe and learn most by watching theyooyounger generation. And I confess I am delighted..."yooyoo"At what?"yooyoo"Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I findyooclearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality..."yooyoo"That's true," Zossimov let drop.yooyoo"Nonsense! There's no practicality." Razumihin flew at him.yoo"Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down fromyooheaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced fromyooall practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting," he said toyooPyotr Petrovitch, "and desire for good exists, though it's in a childishyooform, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.yooAnyway, there's no practicality. Practicality goes well shod."yooyoo"I don't agree with you," Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evidentyooenjoyment. "Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,yoobut one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence ofyooenthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If littleyoohas been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.yooIt's my personal view, if you care to know, that something has beenyooaccomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works areyoocirculating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.yooLiterature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have beenyoorooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselvesyoooff irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a greatyoothing..."yooyoo"He's learnt it by heart to show off!" Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.yooyoo"What?" asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he receivedyoono reply.yooyoo"That's all true," Zossimov hastened to interpose.yooyoo"Isn't it so?" Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.yoo"You must admit," he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade ofyootriumph and superciliousness--he almost added "young man"--"that thereyoois an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science andyooeconomic truth..."yooyoo"A commonplace."yooyoo"No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, 'loveyoothy neighbour,' what came of it?" Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps withyooexcessive haste. "It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with myyooneighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb hasyooit, 'Catch several hares and you won't catch one.' Science now tellsyoous, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests onyooself-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properlyyooand your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better privateyooaffairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--theyoofirmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfareyooorganised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively foryoomyself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring toyoopass my neighbour's getting a little more than a torn coat; and that notyoofrom private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the generalyooadvance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long timeyooreaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet ityoowould seem to want very little wit to perceive it..."yooyoo"Excuse me, I've very little wit myself," Razumihin cut in sharply,yoo"and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I'veyoogrown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuseyoooneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,yooby Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in ayoohurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don't blame you,yoothat's quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man youyooare, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressiveyoocause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everythingyoothey touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That'syooenough!"yooyoo"Excuse me, sir," said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessiveyoodignity. "Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too..."yooyoo"Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that's enough," Razumihinyooconcluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previousyooconversation.yooyooPyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made upyoohis mind to take leave in another minute or two.yooyoo"I trust our acquaintance," he said, addressing Raskolnikov, "may, uponyooyour recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,yoobecome closer... Above all, I hope for your return to health..."yooyooRaskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began gettingyooup from his chair.yooyoo"One of her customers must have killed her," Zossimov declaredyoopositively.yooyoo"Not a doubt of it," replied Razumihin. "Porfiry doesn't give hisyooopinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there."yooyoo"Examining them?" Raskolnikov asked aloud.yooyoo"Yes. What then?"yooyoo"Nothing."yooyoo"How does he get hold of them?" asked Zossimov.yooyoo"Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on theyoowrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves."yooyoo"It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!yooThe coolness!"yooyoo"That's just what it wasn't!" interposed Razumihin. "That's what throwsyooyou all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, notyoopractised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition thatyooit was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn't work. Supposeyoohim to have been inexperienced, and it's clear that it was only a chanceyoothat saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foreseeyooobstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worthyooten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked theyooold woman's trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,yoobesides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not knowyoohow to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,yoohis first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than goodyoocounsel!"yooyoo"You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?" PyotryooPetrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and glovesyooin hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few moreyoointellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourableyooimpression and his vanity overcame his prudence.yooyoo"Yes. You've heard of it?"yooyoo"Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood."yooyoo"Do you know the details?"yooyoo"I can't say that; but another circumstance interests me in theyoocase--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crimeyoohas been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the lastyoofive years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,yoowhat strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,yootoo, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of ayoostudent's robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people ofyoogood social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a wholeyoogang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one ofyoothe ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretaryyooabroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this oldyoowoman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher classyooin society--for peasants don't pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explainyoothis demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?"yooyoo"There are many economic changes," put in Zossimov.yooyoo"How are we to explain it?" Razumihin caught him up. "It might beyooexplained by our inveterate impracticality."yooyoo"How do you mean?"yooyoo"What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why heyoowas forging notes? 'Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so Iyoowant to make haste to get rich too.' I don't remember the exact words,yoobut the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting oryooworking! We've grown used to having everything ready-made, to walkingyooon crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great houryoostruck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours."yooyoo     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.yoo     --TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.yooyoo"But morality? And so to speak, principles..."yooyoo"But why do you worry about it?" Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. "It'syooin accordance with your theory!"yooyoo"In accordance with my theory?"yooyoo"Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, andyooit follows that people may be killed..."yooyoo"Upon my word!" cried Luzhin.yooyoo"No, that's not so," put in Zossimov.yooyooRaskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathingyoopainfully.yooyoo"There's a measure in all things," Luzhin went on superciliously.yoo"Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but toyoosuppose..."yooyoo"And is it true," Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in ayoovoice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, "is it true thatyooyou told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that whatyoopleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was betteryooto raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control overyooher, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?"yooyoo"Upon my word," Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson withyooconfusion, "to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me toyooassure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,yoohas been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspectyoowho... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemedyooto me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhatyoohigh-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand milesyoofrom supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things inyooso fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed..."yooyoo"I tell you what," cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow andyoofixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, "I tell you what."yooyoo"What?" Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.yooSilence lasted for some seconds.yooyoo"Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about myyoomother... I shall send you flying downstairs!"yooyoo"What's the matter with you?" cried Razumihin.yooyoo"So that's how it is?" Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. "Let me tellyooyou, sir," he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himselfyoobut breathing hard, "at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposedyooto me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgiveyooa great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never afteryoothis..."yooyoo"I am not ill," cried Raskolnikov.yooyoo"So much the worse..."yooyoo"Go to hell!"yooyooBut Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezingyoobetween the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let himyoopass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, whoyoohad for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,yoohe went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoidyoocrushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve ofyoohis spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.yooyoo"How could you--how could you!" Razumihin said, shaking his head inyooperplexity.yooyoo"Let me alone--let me alone all of you!" Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.yoo"Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I amyoonot afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,yooalone, alone!"yooyoo"Come along," said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.yooyoo"But we can't leave him like this!"yooyoo"Come along," Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihinyoothought a minute and ran to overtake him.yooyoo"It might be worse not to obey him," said Zossimov on the stairs. "Heyoomustn't be irritated."yooyoo"What's the matter with him?"yooyoo"If only he could get some favourable shock, that's what would do it! Atyoofirst he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Someyoofixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!"yooyoo"Perhaps it's that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversationyooI gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received ayooletter about it just before his illness...."yooyoo"Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But haveyooyou noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond toyooanything except one point on which he seems excited--that's the murder?"yooyoo"Yes, yes," Razumihin agreed, "I noticed that, too. He is interested,yoofrightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the policeyoooffice; he fainted."yooyoo"Tell me more about that this evening and I'll tell you somethingyooafterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I'll go and seeyoohim again.... There'll be no inflammation though."yooyoo"Thanks! And I'll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on himyoothrough Nastasya...."yooyooRaskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,yoobut she still lingered.yooyoo"Won't you have some tea now?" she asked.yooyoo"Later! I am sleepy! Leave me."yooyooHe turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIyooyooBut as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid theyooparcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up againyooand began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have becomeyooperfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panicyoofear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strangeyoosudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose wasyooevident in them. "To-day, to-day," he muttered to himself. He understoodyoothat he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave himyoostrength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would notyoofall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, heyoolooked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment's thoughtyooput it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all theyoocopper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.yooThen he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs andyooglanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her backyooto him, blowing up the landlady's samovar. She heard nothing. Who wouldyoohave dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in theyoostreet.yooyooIt was nearly eight o'clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling asyoobefore, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His headyoofelt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in hisyoofeverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know andyoodid not think where he was going, he had one thought only: "that allyoo_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he wouldyoonot return home without it, because he _would not go on living likeyoothat_." How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,yoohe did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thoughtyootortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must beyoochanged "one way or another," he repeated with desperate and immovableyooself-confidence and determination.yooyooFrom old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the HayyooMarket. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing inyoothe road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a veryyoosentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stoodyooon the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, ayoomantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all veryyooold and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked andyoocoarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper fromyoothe shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a fiveyoocopeck piece and put it in the girl's hand. She broke off abruptly on ayoosentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder "Come on,"yooand both moved on to the next shop.yooyoo"Do you like street music?" said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-agedyooman standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.yooyoo"I love to hear singing to a street organ," said Raskolnikov, and hisyoomanner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--"I like ityooon cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all theyoopassers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wetyoosnow is falling straight down, when there's no wind--you know what Iyoomean?--and the street lamps shine through it..."yooyoo"I don't know.... Excuse me..." muttered the stranger, frightened by theyooquestion and Raskolnikov's strange manner, and he crossed over to theyooother side of the street.yooyooRaskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the HayyooMarket, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; butyoothey were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked roundyooand addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before ayoocorn chandler's shop.yooyoo"Isn't there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?"yooyoo"All sorts of people keep booths here," answered the young man, glancingyoosuperciliously at Raskolnikov.yooyoo"What's his name?"yooyoo"What he was christened."yooyoo"Aren't you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?"yooyooThe young man looked at Raskolnikov again.yooyoo"It's not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciouslyyooforgive me, your excellency!"yooyoo"Is that a tavern at the top there?"yooyoo"Yes, it's an eating-house and there's a billiard-room and you'll findyooprincesses there too.... La-la!"yooyooRaskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowdyooof peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, lookingyooat the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter intoyooconversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; theyyoowere all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little andyootook a turning to the right in the direction of V.yooyooHe had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leadingyoofrom the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawnyooto wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he mightyoofeel more so.yooyooNow he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a greatyooblock of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;yoowomen were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in theiryooindoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,yooespecially about the entrances to various festive establishments inyoothe lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, theyootinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.yooA crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on theyoosteps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunkenyoosoldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,yooswearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but hadyooforgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man deadyoodrunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng ofyoowomen, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and woreyoocotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and someyoonot more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.yooyooHe felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise andyoouproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancingyoofrantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitaryooand of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,yoogloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peepingyooinquisitively in from the pavement.yooyoo  "Oh, my handsome soldieryoo   Don't beat me for nothing,"yooyootrilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire toyoomake out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.yooyoo"Shall I go in?" he thought. "They are laughing. From drink. Shall I getyoodrunk?"yooyoo"Won't you come in?" one of the women asked him. Her voice wasyoostill musical and less thick than the others, she was young and notyoorepulsive--the only one of the group.yooyoo"Why, she's pretty," he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.yooyooShe smiled, much pleased at the compliment.yooyoo"You're very nice looking yourself," she said.yooyoo"Isn't he thin though!" observed another woman in a deep bass. "Have youyoojust come out of a hospital?"yooyoo"They're all generals' daughters, it seems, but they have all snubyoonoses," interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearingyooa loose coat. "See how jolly they are."yooyoo"Go along with you!"yooyoo"I'll go, sweetie!"yooyooAnd he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.yooyoo"I say, sir," the girl shouted after him.yooyoo"What is it?"yooyooShe hesitated.yooyoo"I'll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, butyoonow I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there's a nice youngyooman!"yooyooRaskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.yooyoo"Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!"yooyoo"What's your name?"yooyoo"Ask for Duclida."yooyoo"Well, that's too much," one of the women observed, shaking her headyooat Duclida. "I don't know how you can ask like that. I believe I shouldyoodrop with shame...."yooyooRaskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wenchyooof thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She madeyooher criticism quietly and earnestly. "Where is it," thought Raskolnikov.yoo"Where is it I've read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,yooan hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,yooon such a narrow ledge that he'd only room to stand, and the ocean,yooeverlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest aroundyoohim, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all hisyoolife, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to dieyooat once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...yooHow true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vileyoois he who calls him vile for that," he added a moment later.yooyooHe went into another street. "Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihinyoowas just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was ityooI wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he'd read it in theyoopapers. Have you the papers?" he asked, going into a very spacious andyoopositively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,yoohowever, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in ayooroom further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikovyoofancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at thatyoodistance. "What if it is?" he thought.yooyoo"Will you have vodka?" asked the waiter.yooyoo"Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the lastyoofive days, and I'll give you something."yooyoo"Yes, sir, here's to-day's. No vodka?"yooyooThe old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down andyoobegan to look through them.yooyoo"Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on ayoostaircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fireyooin Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in theyooPetersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....yooAh, here it is!" He found at last what he was seeking and began toyooread it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and beganyooeagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His handsyooshook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someoneyoosat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerkyooZametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and theyoowatch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with theyoosmart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a goodyoohumour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His darkyooface was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.yooyoo"What, you here?" he began in surprise, speaking as though he'd knownyoohim all his life. "Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you wereyoounconscious. How strange! And do you know I've been to see you?"yooyooRaskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers andyooturned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade ofyooirritable impatience was apparent in that smile.yooyoo"I know you have," he answered. "I've heard it. You looked for myyoosock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He saysyooyou've been with him to Luise Ivanovna's--you know, the woman you triedyooto befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and heyoowould not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail toyoounderstand--it was quite clear, wasn't it?"yooyoo"What a hot head he is!"yooyoo"The explosive one?"yooyoo"No, your friend Razumihin."yooyoo"You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the mostyooagreeable places. Who's been pouring champagne into you just now?"yooyoo"We've just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouringyooit into me!"yooyoo"By way of a fee! You profit by everything!" Raskolnikov laughed, "it'syooall right, my dear boy," he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. "Iyooam not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as thatyooworkman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case ofyoothe old woman...."yooyoo"How do you know about it?"yooyoo"Perhaps I know more about it than you do."yooyoo"How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. Youyoooughtn't to have come out."yooyoo"Oh, do I seem strange to you?"yooyoo"Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"There's a lot about the fires."yooyoo"No, I am not reading about the fires." Here he looked mysteriously atyooZametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. "No, I am notyooreading about the fires," he went on, winking at Zametov. "But confessyoonow, my dear fellow, you're awfully anxious to know what I am readingyooabout?"yooyoo"I am not in the least. Mayn't I ask a question? Why do you keepyooon...?"yooyoo"Listen, you are a man of culture and education?"yooyoo"I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium," said Zametov with someyoodignity.yooyoo"Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--youyooare a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!" Here Raskolnikovyoobroke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov's face. The latter drewyooback, more amazed than offended.yooyoo"Foo! how strange you are!" Zametov repeated very seriously. "I can'tyoohelp thinking you are still delirious."yooyoo"I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? Youyoofind me curious, do you?"yooyoo"Yes, curious."yooyoo"Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? Seeyoowhat a lot of papers I've made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?"yooyoo"Well, what is it?"yooyoo"You prick up your ears?"yooyoo"How do you mean--'prick up my ears'?"yooyoo"I'll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,yoobetter 'I confess'... No, that's not right either; 'I make a depositionyooand you take it.' I depose that I was reading, that I was looking andyoosearching...." he screwed up his eyes and paused. "I was searching--andyoocame here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the oldyoopawnbroker woman," he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringingyoohis face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at himyoosteadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametovyooafterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed foryooexactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.yooyoo"What if you have been reading about it?" he cried at last, perplexedyooand impatient. "That's no business of mine! What of it?"yooyoo"The same old woman," Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, notyooheeding Zametov's explanation, "about whom you were talking in theyoopolice-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understandyoonow?"yooyoo"What do you mean? Understand... what?" Zametov brought out, almostyooalarmed.yooyooRaskolnikov's set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and heyoosuddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as thoughyooutterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled withyooextraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, thatyoomoment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latchyootrembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a suddenyoodesire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue atyoothem, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!yooyoo"You are either mad, or..." began Zametov, and he broke off, as thoughyoostunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.yooyoo"Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!"yooyoo"Nothing," said Zametov, getting angry, "it's all nonsense!"yooyooBoth were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov becameyoosuddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table andyooleaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgottenyooZametov. The silence lasted for some time.yooyoo"Why don't you drink your tea? It's getting cold," said Zametov.yooyoo"What! Tea? Oh, yes...." Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel ofyoobread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to rememberyooeverything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his faceyooresumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.yooyoo"There have been a great many of these crimes lately," said Zametov.yoo"Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang ofyoofalse coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. Theyyooused to forge tickets!"yooyoo"Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,"yooRaskolnikov answered calmly. "So you consider them criminals?" he added,yoosmiling.yooyoo"Of course they are criminals."yooyoo"They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundredyoopeople meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be tooyoomany, and then they want to have more faith in one another than inyoothemselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.yooSimpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--whatyooa thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that theseyoosimpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for theyoorest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of hisyoolife! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to changeyoothe notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousandyooroubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,yoobut did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get theyoomoney into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. Andyoothe whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?"yooyoo"That his hands trembled?" observed Zametov, "yes, that's quiteyoopossible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can'tyoostand things."yooyoo"Can't stand that?"yooyoo"Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn't. For the sake of a hundredyooroubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notesyoointo a bank where it's their business to spot that sort of thing! No, Iyooshould not have the face to do it. Would you?"yooyooRaskolnikov had an intense desire again "to put his tongue out." Shiversyookept running down his spine.yooyoo"I should do it quite differently," Raskolnikov began. "This is how Iyoowould change the notes: I'd count the first thousand three or four timesyoobackwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I'd set to theyoosecond thousand; I'd count that half-way through and then hold someyoofifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the lightyooagain--to see whether it was a good one. 'I am afraid,' I would say, 'ayoorelation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through ayoofalse note,' and then I'd tell them the whole story. And after I beganyoocounting the third, 'No, excuse me,' I would say, 'I fancy I made ayoomistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.'yooAnd so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second andyooso on to the end. And when I had finished, I'd pick out one from theyoofifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the lightyooand ask again, 'Change them, please,' and put the clerk into such a stewyoothat he would not know how to get rid of me. When I'd finished and hadyoogone out, I'd come back, 'No, excuse me,' and ask for some explanation.yooThat's how I'd do it."yooyoo"Foo! what terrible things you say!" said Zametov, laughing. "But allyoothat is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you'd make a slip.yooI believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon onyoohimself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that oldyoowoman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been ayoodesperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved byyooa miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing theyooplace, he couldn't stand it. That was clear from the..."yooyooRaskolnikov seemed offended.yooyoo"Clear? Why don't you catch him then?" he cried, maliciously gibing atyooZametov.yooyoo"Well, they will catch him."yooyoo"Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You've a tough job! Ayoogreat point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he hadyoono money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that anyyoochild can mislead you."yooyoo"The fact is they always do that, though," answered Zametov. "A man willyoocommit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goesyoodrinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not allyooas cunning as you are. You wouldn't go to a tavern, of course?"yooyooRaskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.yooyoo"You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I shouldyoobehave in that case, too?" he asked with displeasure.yooyoo"I should like to," Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat tooyoomuch earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.yooyoo"Very much?"yooyoo"Very much!"yooyoo"All right then. This is how I should behave," Raskolnikov began, againyoobringing his face close to Zametov's, again staring at him and speakingyooin a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. "This is whatyooI should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I shouldyoohave walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted placeyoowith fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen gardenyooor place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stoneyooweighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner fromyoothe time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sureyooto be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in thatyoohole. Then I'd roll the stone back so that it would look as before,yoowould press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,yoothree maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There'dyoobe no trace."yooyoo"You are a madman," said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in ayoowhisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. Heyoohad turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.yooHe bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to moveyoowithout uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what heyoowas doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled onyoohis lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will breakyooout, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.yooyoo"And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?" he saidyoosuddenly and--realised what he had done.yooyooZametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. Hisyooface wore a contorted smile.yooyoo"But is it possible?" he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov lookedyoowrathfully at him.yooyoo"Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?"yooyoo"Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now," Zametov criedyoohastily.yooyoo"I've caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now youyoobelieve less than ever?"yooyoo"Not at all," cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. "Have you beenyoofrightening me so as to lead up to this?"yooyoo"You don't believe it then? What were you talking about behind myyooback when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosiveyoolieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there," he shouted to theyoowaiter, getting up and taking his cap, "how much?"yooyoo"Thirty copecks," the latter replied, running up.yooyoo"And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!" heyooheld out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. "Red notes andyooblue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my newyooclothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You've cross-examined myyoolandlady, I'll be bound.... Well, that's enough! _Assez causé!_ Till weyoomeet again!"yooyooHe went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hystericalyoosensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet heyoowas gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.yooHis fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensationyoostimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed asyooquickly when the stimulus was removed.yooyooZametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged inyoothought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain onyooa certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.yooyoo"Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead," he decided.yooyooRaskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when heyoostumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each otheryootill they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stoodyoolooking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, thenyooanger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.yooyoo"So here you are!" he shouted at the top of his voice--"you ran awayyoofrom your bed! And here I've been looking for you under the sofa! Weyoowent up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And hereyoohe is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the wholeyootruth! Confess! Do you hear?"yooyoo"It means that I'm sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,"yooRaskolnikov answered calmly.yooyoo"Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as ayoosheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doingyooin the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!"yooyoo"Let me go!" said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too muchyoofor Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.yooyoo"Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I'll doyoowith you directly? I'll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry youyoohome under my arm and lock you up!"yooyoo"Listen, Razumihin," Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--"can'tyooyou see that I don't want your benevolence? A strange desire you have toyooshower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden inyoofact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe Iyoowas very glad to die. Didn't I tell you plainly enough to-day thatyooyou were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want toyootorture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering myyoorecovery, because it's continually irritating me. You saw Zossimovyoowent away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, foryoogoodness' sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don'tyooyou see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how canyooI persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may beyooungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God's sake, let me be!yooLet me be, let me be!"yooyooHe began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he wasyooabout to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he hadyoobeen with Luzhin.yooyooRazumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.yooyoo"Well, go to hell then," he said gently and thoughtfully. "Stay," heyooroared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. "Listen to me. Let me tellyooyou, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you've anyyoolittle trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you areyooplagiarists even in that! There isn't a sign of independent life inyooyou! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you've lymph in your veinsyooinstead of blood. I don't believe in anyone of you! In any circumstancesyoothe first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!" heyoocried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again makingyooa movement--"hear me out! You know I'm having a house-warming thisyooevening, I dare say they've arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--Iyoojust ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren't a fool, a commonyoofool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...yooyou see, Rodya, I recognise you're a clever fellow, but you're ayoofool!--and if you weren't a fool you'd come round to me this eveningyooinstead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have goneyooout, there's no help for it! I'd give you a snug easy chair, my landladyyoohas one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--anyyooway you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?"yooyoo"No."yooyoo"R-rubbish!" Razumihin shouted, out of patience. "How do you know?yooYou can't answer for yourself! You don't know anything about it....yooThousands of times I've fought tooth and nail with people and run backyooto them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! Soyooremember, Potchinkov's house on the third storey...."yooyoo"Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you'd let anybody beat you from sheeryoobenevolence."yooyoo"Beat? Whom? Me? I'd twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkov'syoohouse, 47, Babushkin's flat...."yooyoo"I shall not come, Razumihin." Raskolnikov turned and walked away.yooyoo"I bet you will," Razumihin shouted after him. "I refuse to know you ifyooyou don't! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"Did you see him?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"Talked to him?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"What about? Confound you, don't tell me then. Potchinkov's house, 47,yooBabushkin's flat, remember!"yooyooRaskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.yooRazumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand heyoowent into the house but stopped short of the stairs.yooyoo"Confound it," he went on almost aloud. "He talked sensibly but yet...yooI am a fool! As if madmen didn't talk sensibly! And this was just whatyooZossimov seemed afraid of." He struck his finger on his forehead. "Whatyooif... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,yoowhat a blunder! I can't." And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, butyoothere was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps toyoothe Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.yooyooRaskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, andyooleaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On partingyoowith Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach thisyooplace. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bendingyooover the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of theyoosunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, atyooone distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire inyoothe last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,yooand the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashedyoobefore his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canalyoobanks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,yoosaved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. Heyoobecame aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he lookedyooand saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,yoowasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, butyooobviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned heryooright hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, thenyooher left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted andyooswallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowningyoowoman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her headyooand legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.yooyoo"A woman drowning! A woman drowning!" shouted dozens of voices; peopleyooran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge peopleyoocrowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.yooyoo"Mercy on it! it's our Afrosinya!" a woman cried tearfully close by.yoo"Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!"yooyoo"A boat, a boat" was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of ayooboat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his greatyoocoat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:yooshe floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold ofyooher clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which ayoocomrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. Theyyoolaid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recoveredyooconsciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,yoostupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.yooyoo"She's drunk herself out of her senses," the same woman's voice wailedyooat her side. "Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hangyooherself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my littleyoogirl to look after her--and here she's in trouble again! A neighbour,yoogentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,yoosee yonder...."yooyooThe crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someoneyoomentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strangeyoosensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. "No, that'syooloathsome... water... it's not good enough," he muttered to himself.yoo"Nothing will come of it," he added, "no use to wait. What about theyoopolice office...? And why isn't Zametov at the police office? The policeyoooffice is open till ten o'clock...." He turned his back to the railingyooand looked about him.yooyoo"Very well then!" he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge andyoowalked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow andyooempty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, thereyoowas not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out "to make anyooend of it all." Complete apathy had succeeded to it.yooyoo"Well, it's a way out of it," he thought, walking slowly and listlesslyyooalong the canal bank. "Anyway I'll make an end, for I want to.... Butyoois it a way out? What does it matter! There'll be the square yard ofyoospace--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them oryoonot? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lieyoodown soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don'tyoocare about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one's head."yooyooTo reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take theyoosecond turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at theyoofirst turning he stopped and, after a minute's thought, turned into ayooside street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without anyyooobject, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, lookingyooat the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he liftedyoohis head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.yooHe had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.yooAn overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into theyoohouse, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on theyooright, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.yooThe narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landingyooand looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the frameworkyooof the window had been taken out. "That wasn't so then," he thought.yooHere was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had beenyooworking. "It's shut up and the door newly painted. So it's to let." Thenyoothe third storey and the fourth. "Here!" He was perplexed to find theyoodoor of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;yoohe had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the lastyoostairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there wereyooworkmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that heyoowould find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in theyoosame places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemedyoostrange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. Thereyoowere two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than theyooother. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered withyoolilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov foryoosome reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paperyoowith dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.yooThe workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they wereyoohurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They tookyoono notice of Raskolnikov's coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikovyoofolded his arms and listened.yooyoo"She comes to me in the morning," said the elder to the younger, "veryyooearly, all dressed up. 'Why are you preening and prinking?' says I. 'Iyooam ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!' That's a way ofyoogoing on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!"yooyoo"And what is a fashion book?" the younger one asked. He obviouslyyooregarded the other as an authority.yooyoo"A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to theyootailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks howyooto dress, the male sex as well as the female. They're pictures. Theyoogentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies' fluffles,yoothey're beyond anything you can fancy."yooyoo"There's nothing you can't find in Petersburg," the younger criedyooenthusiastically, "except father and mother, there's everything!"yooyoo"Except them, there's everything to be found, my boy," the elderyoodeclared sententiously.yooyooRaskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,yoothe bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him veryyootiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in theyoocorner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it andyoowent to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.yooyoo"What do you want?" he asked suddenly.yooyooInstead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled theyoobell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second andyooa third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisinglyyoofearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and moreyoovividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and moreyoosatisfaction.yooyoo"Well, what do you want? Who are you?" the workman shouted, going out toyoohim. Raskolnikov went inside again.yooyoo"I want to take a flat," he said. "I am looking round."yooyoo"It's not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come upyoowith the porter."yooyoo"The floors have been washed, will they be painted?" Raskolnikov wentyooon. "Is there no blood?"yooyoo"What blood?"yooyoo"Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was ayooperfect pool there."yooyoo"But who are you?" the workman cried, uneasy.yooyoo"Who am I?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"You want to know? Come to the police station, I'll tell you."yooyooThe workmen looked at him in amazement.yooyoo"It's time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lockyooup," said the elder workman.yooyoo"Very well, come along," said Raskolnikov indifferently, and goingyooout first, he went slowly downstairs. "Hey, porter," he cried in theyoogateway.yooyooAt the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;yoothe two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.yooRaskolnikov went straight up to them.yooyoo"What do you want?" asked one of the porters.yooyoo"Have you been to the police office?"yooyoo"I've just been there. What do you want?"yooyoo"Is it open?"yooyoo"Of course."yooyoo"Is the assistant there?"yooyoo"He was there for a time. What do you want?"yooyooRaskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.yooyoo"He's been to look at the flat," said the elder workman, coming forward.yooyoo"Which flat?"yooyoo"Where we are at work. 'Why have you washed away the blood?' says he.yoo'There has been a murder here,' says he, 'and I've come to take it.'yooAnd he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. 'Come to the policeyoostation,' says he. 'I'll tell you everything there.' He wouldn't leaveyoous."yooyooThe porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.yooyoo"Who are you?" he shouted as impressively as he could.yooyoo"I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live inyooShil's house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, heyooknows me." Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, notyooturning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.yooyoo"Why have you been to the flat?"yooyoo"To look at it."yooyoo"What is there to look at?"yooyoo"Take him straight to the police station," the man in the long coatyoojerked in abruptly.yooyooRaskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in theyoosame slow, lazy tones:yooyoo"Come along."yooyoo"Yes, take him," the man went on more confidently. "Why was he goingyoointo _that_, what's in his mind, eh?"yooyoo"He's not drunk, but God knows what's the matter with him," muttered theyooworkman.yooyoo"But what do you want?" the porter shouted again, beginning to get angryyooin earnest--"Why are you hanging about?"yooyoo"You funk the police station then?" said Raskolnikov jeeringly.yooyoo"How funk it? Why are you hanging about?"yooyoo"He's a rogue!" shouted the peasant woman.yooyoo"Why waste time talking to him?" cried the other porter, a huge peasantyooin a full open coat and with keys on his belt. "Get along! He is a rogueyooand no mistake. Get along!"yooyooAnd seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. Heyoolurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators inyoosilence and walked away.yooyoo"Strange man!" observed the workman.yooyoo"There are strange folks about nowadays," said the woman.yooyoo"You should have taken him to the police station all the same," said theyooman in the long coat.yooyoo"Better have nothing to do with him," decided the big porter. "A regularyoorogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, youyoowon't get rid of him.... We know the sort!"yooyoo"Shall I go there or not?" thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middleyooof the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, asyoothough expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, allyoowas dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, toyoohim alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yardsyooaway, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.yooIn the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in theyoomiddle of the street. "What is it?" Raskolnikov turned to the rightyooand went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiledyoocoldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go toyoothe police station and knew that it would all soon be over.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIIyooyooAn elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair ofyoospirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had gotyoooff his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....yooA mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. Oneyooof them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lyingyooclose to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; theyoocoachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:yooyoo"What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!"yooyooRaskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at lastyooin seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground ayooman who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered withyooblood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood wasyooflowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated andyoodisfigured. He was evidently badly injured.yooyoo"Merciful heaven!" wailed the coachman, "what more could I do? If I'dyoobeen driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,yoonot in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybodyyooelse. A drunken man can't walk straight, we all know.... I saw himyoocrossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted againyooand a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fellyoostraight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was veryyootipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,yoohe screamed... that made them worse. That's how it happened!"yooyoo"That's just how it was," a voice in the crowd confirmed.yooyoo"He shouted, that's true, he shouted three times," another voiceyoodeclared.yooyoo"Three times it was, we all heard it," shouted a third.yooyooBut the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It wasyooevident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person whoyoowas awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no littleyooanxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was toyootake the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knewyoohis name.yooyooMeanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. Theyoolantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man's face. He recognisedyoohim.yooyoo"I know him! I know him!" he shouted, pushing to the front. "It's ayoogovernment clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives closeyooby in Kozel's house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?" Heyoopulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was inyooviolent agitation.yooyooThe police were glad that they had found out who the man was.yooRaskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if ityoohad been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconsciousyooMarmeladov to his lodging at once.yooyoo"Just here, three houses away," he said eagerly, "the house belongs toyooKozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,yoohe is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has oneyoodaughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there isyoosure to be a doctor in the house. I'll pay, I'll pay! At least he willyoobe looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he'll dieyoobefore you get him to the hospital." He managed to slip somethingyoounseen into the policeman's hand. But the thing was straightforwardyooand legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised theyooinjured man; people volunteered to help.yooyooKozel's house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,yoocarefully holding Marmeladov's head and showing the way.yooyoo"This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turnyooround! I'll pay, I'll make it worth your while," he muttered.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every freeyoomoment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove andyooback again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herselfyooand coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldestyoogirl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did notyoounderstand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and soyooalways watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmostyooto appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her littleyoobrother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy wasyoowaiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.yooHe was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,yooserious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heelsyootogether and toes turned out.yooyooHe was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sittingyooperfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all goodyoolittle boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A littleyoogirl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,yoowaiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieveyoothem a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from theyooother rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,yooconsumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinneryooduring that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter thanyooever.yooyoo"You wouldn't believe, you can't imagine, Polenka," she said, walkingyooabout the room, "what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa's houseyooand how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!yooPapa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so thatyooeveryone who came to see him said, 'We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,yooas our governor!' When I... when..." she coughed violently, "oh, cursedyoolife," she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to heryoobreast, "when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal's...yooPrincess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your fatheryooand I were married, Polenka--she asked at once 'Isn't that the prettyyoogirl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?' (You must mendyoothat tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, oryooto-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger," sheyooarticulated with effort.) "Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had justyoocome from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted toyoomake me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressionsyooand told him that my heart had long been another's. That other was youryoofather, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give meyoothe shirt, and the stockings! Lida," said she to the youngest one, "youyoomust manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings outyoowith it... I'll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabondyoodoesn't come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,yoohe has torn it to rags! I'd do it all together, so as not to have toyoowork two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!yooWhat's this?" she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,yoowho were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. "What is it? What areyoothey bringing? Mercy on us!"yooyoo"Where are we to put him?" asked the policeman, looking round whenyooMarmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.yooyoo"On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,"yooRaskolnikov showed him.yooyoo"Run over in the road! Drunk!" someone shouted in the passage.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. Theyoochildren were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka andyooclutched at her, trembling all over.yooyooHaving laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.yooyoo"For God's sake be calm, don't be frightened!" he said, speakingyooquickly, "he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don'tyoobe frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I've beenyoohere already, you remember? He will come to; I'll pay!"yooyoo"He's done it this time!" Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and sheyoorushed to her husband.yooyooRaskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women whoyooswoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man's head ayoopillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examiningyoohim. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lipsyooand stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.yooyooRaskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was ayoodoctor, it appeared, next door but one.yooyoo"I've sent for a doctor," he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, "don't beyoouneasy, I'll pay. Haven't you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,yooanything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believeyoome.... We shall see what the doctor says!"yooyooKaterina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in theyoocorner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, inyooreadiness for washing her children's and husband's linen that night.yooThis washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice ayooweek, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that theyyoowere practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna couldyoonot endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, sheyoopreferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength whenyoothe rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dryyooby the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov's request,yoobut almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had alreadyyoosucceeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood offyooMarmeladov's face.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her handsyooto her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov beganyooto realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured manyoobrought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.yooyoo"Polenka," cried Katerina Ivanovna, "run to Sonia, make haste. If youyoodon't find her at home, leave word that her father has been run overyooand that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!yoothere, put on the shawl."yooyoo"Run your fastest!" cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, afteryoowhich he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, hisyooheels thrust forward and his toes spread out.yooyooMeanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn't haveyoodropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for ayootime, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almostyooall Madame Lippevechsel's lodgers had streamed in from the inner roomsyooof the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, butyooafterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into ayoofury.yooyoo"You might let him die in peace, at least," she shouted at the crowd,yoo"is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,yoocough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in hisyoohat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!"yooyooHer cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. Theyyooevidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one afteryooanother, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feelingyooof satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a suddenyooaccident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from whichyoono living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy andyoocompassion.yooyooVoices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and sayingyoothat they'd no business to make a disturbance here.yooyoo"No business to die!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing toyoothe door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face toyooface with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accidentyooand ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome andyooirresponsible German.yooyoo"Ah, my God!" she cried, clasping her hands, "your husband drunkenyoohorses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!"yooyoo"Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,"yooKaterina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone withyoothe landlady that she might "remember her place" and even now could notyoodeny herself this satisfaction). "Amalia Ludwigovna..."yooyoo"I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna mayyoonot dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna."yooyoo"You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am notyooone of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who's laughingyoobehind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of 'they are at ityooagain' was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call youyooAmalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike thatyooname. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;yoohe is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.yooLet him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,yoohimself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knewyoome as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often beenyooa benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had manyyoofriends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourableyoopride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed toyooRaskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who hasyoowealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from ayoochild. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna..."yooyooAll this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,yoobut a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna's eloquence. At thatyooinstant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; sheyooran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition oryoounderstanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drewyoodeep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouthyooand drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognisingyooRaskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna lookedyooat him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.yooyoo"My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding," she saidyooin despair. "We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, SemyonyooZaharovitch, if you can," she cried to him.yooyooMarmeladov recognised her.yooyoo"A priest," he articulated huskily.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the windowyooframe and exclaimed in despair:yooyoo"Oh, cursed life!"yooyoo"A priest," the dying man said again after a moment's silence.yooyoo"They've gone for him," Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed heryooshout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; sheyooreturned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not foryoolong.yooyooSoon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking inyoothe corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with heryoowondering childish eyes.yooyoo"A-ah," he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.yooyoo"What now?" cried Katerina Ivanovna.yooyoo"Barefoot, barefoot!" he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes theyoochild's bare feet.yooyoo"Be silent," Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, "you know why she isyoobarefooted."yooyoo"Thank God, the doctor," exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.yooyooThe doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking aboutyoohim mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefullyyoofelt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned theyooblood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man's chest. It was gashed,yoocrushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.yooOn the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-lookingyooyellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse's hoof. The doctoryoofrowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel andyooturned round with it for thirty yards on the road.yooyoo"It's wonderful that he has recovered consciousness," the doctoryoowhispered softly to Raskolnikov.yooyoo"What do you think of him?" he asked.yooyoo"He will die immediately."yooyoo"Is there really no hope?"yooyoo"Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,yootoo... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.yooHe is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes."yooyoo"Better bleed him then."yooyoo"If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless."yooyooAt that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,yooand the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearingyoothe sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.yooThe doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.yooRaskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged hisyooshoulders and remained.yooyooAll stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probablyyoounderstood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.yooKaterina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, kneltyoodown in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front ofyooher. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on hisyoolittle bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself withyooprecision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, whichyooseemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit heryoolips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pullingyoostraight the boy's shirt, and managed to cover the girl's bare shouldersyoowith a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from heryooknees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms wasyooopened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators fromyooall the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did notyooventure beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.yooyooAt that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. Sheyoocame in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked foryooher mother, went up to her and said, "She's coming, I met her in theyoostreet." Her mother made her kneel beside her.yooyooTimidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,yooand strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,yoodeath and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all ofyoothe cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,yoounmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in theyoodoorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.yooShe forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here withyooits ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up theyoowhole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she broughtyoowith her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hatyoowith its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hatyoowas a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring inyooterror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, ratheryoopretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and theyoopriest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, someyoowords in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took ayoostep forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.yooyooThe service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.yooThe priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition andyooconsolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.yooyoo"What am I to do with these?" she interrupted sharply and irritably,yoopointing to the little ones.yooyoo"God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour," the priest began.yooyoo"Ach! He is merciful, but not to us."yooyoo"That's a sin, a sin, madam," observed the priest, shaking his head.yooyoo"And isn't that a sin?" cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dyingyooman.yooyoo"Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree toyoocompensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings."yooyoo"You don't understand!" cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.yoo"And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himselfyoounder the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.yooHe drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, heyoowasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he's dying! Oneyooless to keep!"yooyoo"You must forgive in the hour of death, that's a sin, madam, suchyoofeelings are a great sin."yooyooKaterina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,yoowiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,yooand had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Nowyooshe flew at him almost in a frenzy.yooyoo"Ah, father! That's words and only words! Forgive! If he'd not been runyooover, he'd have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty andyooin rags and he'd have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have beenyoosousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children'syooand then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight Iyooshould have been darning them. That's how I spend my nights!... What'syoothe use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!"yooyooA terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchiefyooto her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to heryooaching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowedyoohis head and said nothing.yooyooMarmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the faceyooof Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept tryingyooto say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty andyooarticulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that heyoowanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:yooyoo"Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!" And the sick manyoowas silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to theyoodoorway and he saw Sonia.yooyooTill then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in ayoocorner.yooyoo"Who's that? Who's that?" he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,yooin agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where hisyoodaughter was standing, and trying to sit up.yooyoo"Lie down! Lie do-own!" cried Katerina Ivanovna.yooyooWith unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on hisyooelbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, asyoothough not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.yooSuddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation andyoogaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dyingyoofather. His face showed intense suffering.yooyoo"Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!" he cried, and he tried to hold out his handyooto her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards onyoothe floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but heyoowas dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained soyoowithout moving. He died in her arms.yooyoo"He's got what he wanted," Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband'syoodead body. "Well, what's to be done now? How am I to bury him! What canyooI give them to-morrow to eat?"yooyooRaskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.yooyoo"Katerina Ivanovna," he began, "last week your husband told me all hisyoolife and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionateyooreverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to youyooall and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,yooin spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we becameyoofriends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to myyoodead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of anyyooassistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I willyoobe sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....yooGood-bye!"yooyooAnd he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowdyooto the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against NikodimyooFomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructionsyooin person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, butyooNikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.yooyoo"Ah, is that you?" he asked him.yooyoo"He's dead," answered Raskolnikov. "The doctor and the priest have been,yooall as it should have been. Don't worry the poor woman too much, she isyooin consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are ayookind-hearted man, I know..." he added with a smile, looking straight inyoohis face.yooyoo"But you are spattered with blood," observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticingyooin the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov's waistcoat.yooyoo"Yes... I'm covered with blood," Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;yoothen he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.yooyooHe walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not consciousyooof it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life andyoostrength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might beyoocompared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly beenyoopardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest onyoohis way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greetingyoowith him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapidyoofootsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She wasyoorunning after him, calling "Wait! wait!"yooyooHe turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stoppedyooshort a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikovyoocould distinguish the child's thin but pretty little face, looking atyoohim with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a messageyoowhich she was evidently glad to give.yooyoo"Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?" she saidyoohurriedly in a breathless voice.yooyooHe laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort ofyoorapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have saidyoowhy.yooyoo"Who sent you?"yooyoo"Sister Sonia sent me," answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.yooyoo"I knew it was sister Sonia sent you."yooyoo"Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,yootoo, and said 'Run fast, Polenka.'"yooyoo"Do you love sister Sonia?"yooyoo"I love her more than anyone," Polenka answered with a peculiaryooearnestness, and her smile became graver.yooyoo"And will you love me?"yooyooBy way of answer he saw the little girl's face approaching him, her fullyoolips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticksyooheld him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girlyoowept softly, pressing her face against him.yooyoo"I am sorry for father," she said a moment later, raising heryootear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. "It'syoonothing but misfortunes now," she added suddenly with that peculiarlyyoosedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speakyoolike grown-up people.yooyoo"Did your father love you?"yooyoo"He loved Lida most," she went on very seriously without a smile,yooexactly like grown-up people, "he loved her because she is little andyoobecause she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. Butyoohe taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too," she added withyoodignity. "And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that sheyooliked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,yoofor it's time my education began."yooyoo"And do you know your prayers?"yooyoo"Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myselfyooas I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.yooFirst they repeat the 'Ave Maria' and then another prayer: 'Lord,yooforgive and bless sister Sonia,' and then another, 'Lord, forgive andyoobless our second father.' For our elder father is dead and this isyooanother one, but we do pray for the other as well."yooyoo"Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. 'And Thyyooservant Rodion,' nothing more."yooyoo"I'll pray for you all the rest of my life," the little girl declaredyoohotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged himyoowarmly once more.yooyooRaskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure toyoocome next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was pastyooten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing onyoothe bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.yooyoo"Enough," he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. "I've done withyoofancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven't I livedyoojust now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom ofyooHeaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for theyooreign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and nowyoowe will see! We will try our strength!" he added defiantly, as thoughyoochallenging some power of darkness. "And I was ready to consent to liveyooin a square of space!yooyoo"I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.yooI knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov's houseyoois only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even ifyooit were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him someyoosatisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, youyoocan get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that'syoowhat they don't know," he added proudly and self-confidently andyoohe walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride andyooself-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becomingyooa different man every moment. What was it had happened to work thisyoorevolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at ayoostraw, he suddenly felt that he, too, 'could live, that there was stillyoolife for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.' Perhaps heyoowas in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think ofyoothat.yooyoo"But I did ask her to remember 'Thy servant Rodion' in her prayers," theyooidea struck him. "Well, that was... in case of emergency," he added andyoolaughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.yooyooHe easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known atyooPotchinkov's and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-wayyooupstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a bigyoogathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he couldyoohear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin's room was fairly large; theyoocompany consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,yoowhere two of the landlady's servants were busy behind a screen with twoyoosamovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought upyoofrom the landlady's kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ranyooout delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had ayoogreat deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quiteyoodrunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.yooyoo"Listen," Raskolnikov hastened to say, "I've only just come to tell youyooyou've won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen toyoohim. I can't come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. Andyooso good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow."yooyoo"Do you know what? I'll see you home. If you say you're weak yourself,yooyou must..."yooyoo"And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peepedyooout?"yooyoo"He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle's, I expect, or perhapsyoohe has come without being invited... I'll leave uncle with them, heyoois an invaluable person, pity I can't introduce you to him now. Butyooconfound them all now! They won't notice me, and I need a little freshyooair, for you've come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and Iyooshould have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...yooyou simply can't imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn't youyooimagine? Don't we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that's theyooway to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I'll fetch Zossimov."yooyooZossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a specialyoointerest in him; soon his face brightened.yooyoo"You must go to bed at once," he pronounced, examining the patient asyoofar as he could, "and take something for the night. Will you take it? Iyoogot it ready some time ago... a powder."yooyoo"Two, if you like," answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.yooyoo"It's a good thing you are taking him home," observed Zossimov toyooRazumihin--"we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he's not at allyooamiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn..."yooyoo"Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?"yooRazumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. "I won't tellyooyou everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told meyooto talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, andyooafterwards I am to tell him about it, for he's got a notion in his headyoothat you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,yooyou've three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,yooyou needn't care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,yoothat piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mentalyoodiseases, and what's brought him to this conclusion about you was youryooconversation to-day with Zametov."yooyoo"Zametov told you all about it?"yooyoo"Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so doesyooZametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a littleyoodrunk now.... But that's... no matter... the point is that thisyooidea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... youyoounderstand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the ideayoois too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, thatyoobubble's burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gaveyooZametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that's between ourselves,yoobrother; please don't let out a hint that you know of it; I've noticedyoohe is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna's. But to-day, to-dayyooit's all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! Heyootook advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamedyooof it himself now; I know that..."yooyooRaskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk tooyoofreely.yooyoo"I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint," saidyooRaskolnikov.yooyoo"No need to explain that! And it wasn't the paint only: the fever hadyoobeen coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushedyoothat boy is now, you wouldn't believe! 'I am not worth his littleyoofinger,' he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,yoobrother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palaisyoode Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,yooyou know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convincedyoohim again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then youyoosuddenly--put out your tongue at him: 'There now, what do you make ofyooit?' It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, byyooJove, it's what they deserve! Ah, that I wasn't there! He was hoping toyoosee you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance..."yooyoo"Ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?"yooyoo"Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,yooyou see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it'syooclear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... andyoohow that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a littleyoodrunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... Iyootell you, he's mad on mental diseases. But don't you mind him..."yooyooFor half a minute both were silent.yooyoo"Listen, Razumihin," began Raskolnikov, "I want to tell you plainly:yooI've just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... I gave them all myyoomoney... and besides I've just been kissed by someone who, if I hadyookilled anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone elseyoothere... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; Iyooam very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly..."yooyoo"What's the matter? What's the matter with you?" Razumihin askedyooanxiously.yooyoo"I am a little giddy, but that's not the point, I am so sad, so sad...yoolike a woman. Look, what's that? Look, look!"yooyoo"What is it?"yooyoo"Don't you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack..."yooyooThey were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the levelyooof the landlady's door, and they could, as a fact, see from below thatyoothere was a light in Raskolnikov's garret.yooyoo"Queer! Nastasya, perhaps," observed Razumihin.yooyoo"She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,yoobut... I don't care! Good-bye!"yooyoo"What do you mean? I am coming with you, we'll come in together!"yooyoo"I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and sayyoogood-bye to you here. So give me your hand, good-bye!"yooyoo"What's the matter with you, Rodya?"yooyoo"Nothing... come along... you shall be witness."yooyooThey began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin thatyooperhaps Zossimov might be right after all. "Ah, I've upset him with myyoochatter!" he muttered to himself.yooyooWhen they reached the door they heard voices in the room.yooyoo"What is it?" cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open theyoodoor; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.yooyooHis mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting anyoohour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought ofyoothem, though the news that they had started, were on their way and wouldyooarrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They hadyoospent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She wasyoostanding before them and had told them everything by now. They wereyoobeside themselves with alarm when they heard of his "running away"yooto-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! "GoodyooHeavens, what had become of him?" Both had been weeping, both had beenyooin anguish for that hour and a half.yooyooA cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov's entrance. Both rushed toyoohim. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struckyoohim like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, heyoocould not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,yoolaughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,yoofainting.yooyooAnxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in theyoodoorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms andyooin a moment had him on the sofa.yooyoo"It's nothing, nothing!" he cried to the mother and sister--"it's only ayoofaint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better,yoothat he is perfectly well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he isyooall right again!"yooyooAnd seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he madeyooher bend down to see that "he is all right again." The mother and sisteryoolooked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. Theyyoohad heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodyayooduring his illness, by this "very competent young man," as PulcheriayooAlexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation withyooDounia.yooyooyooyooyooPART IIIyooyooyooyooCHAPTER IyooyooRaskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weaklyyooto Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolationsyoohe was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the handyooand for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.yooHis mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotionyooagonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almostyooinsane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.yooyooAvdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother's.yooyoo"Go home... with him," he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,yoo"good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since youyooarrived?"yooyoo"This evening, Rodya," answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "the train wasyooawfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! Iyoowill spend the night here, near you..."yooyoo"Don't torture me!" he said with a gesture of irritation.yooyoo"I will stay with him," cried Razumihin, "I won't leave him for ayoomoment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts' content!yooMy uncle is presiding there."yooyoo"How, how can I thank you!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, onceyoomore pressing Razumihin's hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.yooyoo"I can't have it! I can't have it!" he repeated irritably, "don't worryyoome! Enough, go away... I can't stand it!"yooyoo"Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute," Douniayoowhispered in dismay; "we are distressing him, that's evident."yooyoo"Mayn't I look at him after three years?" wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"Stay," he stopped them again, "you keep interrupting me, and my ideasyooget muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?"yooyoo"No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,yoothat Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today," PulcheriayooAlexandrovna added somewhat timidly.yooyoo"Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I'd throw himyoodownstairs and told him to go to hell...."yooyoo"Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don't mean to tell us..."yooPulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking atyooDounia.yooyooAvdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waitingyoofor what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel fromyooNastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,yooand were in painful perplexity and suspense.yooyoo"Dounia," Raskolnikov continued with an effort, "I don't want thatyoomarriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,yooso that we may never hear his name again."yooyoo"Good Heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"Brother, think what you are saying!" Avdotya Romanovna beganyooimpetuously, but immediately checked herself. "You are not fit to talkyoonow, perhaps; you are tired," she added gently.yooyoo"You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_yoosake. But I won't accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter beforeyooto-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that willyoobe the end of it!"yooyoo"That I can't do!" the girl cried, offended, "what right have you..."yooyoo"Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don't you see..."yoothe mother interposed in dismay. "Better come away!"yooyoo"He is raving," Razumihin cried tipsily, "or how would he dare!yooTo-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly didyoodrive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He madeyoospeeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went outyoocrest-fallen...."yooyoo"Then it's true?" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"Good-bye till to-morrow, brother," said Dounia compassionately--"let usyoogo, mother... Good-bye, Rodya."yooyoo"Do you hear, sister," he repeated after them, making a last effort,yoo"I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act likeyooa scoundrel, but you mustn't... one is enough... and though I am ayooscoundrel, I wouldn't own such a sister. It's me or Luzhin! Go now...."yooyoo"But you're out of your mind! Despot!" roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikovyoodid not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, andyooturned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked withyoointerest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positivelyyoostarted at her glance.yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.yooyoo"Nothing would induce me to go," she whispered in despair to Razumihin.yoo"I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home."yooyoo"You'll spoil everything," Razumihin answered in the same whisper,yoolosing patience--"come out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show ayoolight! I assure you," he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--"thatyoohe was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do youyoounderstand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as notyooto irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at onceyooand slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at thisyootime of night, and will do himself some mischief...."yooyoo"What are you saying?"yooyoo"And Avdotya Romanovna can't possibly be left in those lodgings withoutyooyou. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitchyoocouldn't find you better lodgings... But you know I've had a little toyoodrink, and that's what makes me... swear; don't mind it...."yooyoo"But I'll go to the landlady here," Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,yoo"I'll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. Iyoocan't leave him like that, I cannot!"yooyooThis conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady'syoodoor. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was inyooextraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringingyooRaskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware ofyooit himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities heyoohad imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that heyoohad drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood withyoothe two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and givingyoothem reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost everyyooword he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed theiryoohands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without theyooleast regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out ofyoohis huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drewyoothem all the closer to him. If they'd told him to jump head foremostyoofrom the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitationyooin their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young manyoowas really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxietyyooover her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and wasyoounwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovnayooshared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could notyoosee the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. Ityoowas only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya's account of heryoobrother's queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away fromyoohim, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,yoothat even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,yoohowever, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic ofyooRazumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he mightyoobe in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.yooyoo"You can't go to the landlady, that's perfect nonsense!" he cried. "Ifyooyou stay, though you are his mother, you'll drive him to a frenzy, andyoothen goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I'll tell you what I'llyoodo: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I'll conduct you both home, youyoocan't be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in thatyooway.... But no matter! Then I'll run straight back here and a quarter ofyooan hour later, on my word of honour, I'll bring you news how he is,yoowhether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I'll run home inyooa twinkling--I've a lot of friends there, all drunk--I'll fetchyooZossimov--that's the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,yoobut he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I'll drag himyooto Rodya, and then to you, so that you'll get two reports in theyoohour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that's ayoovery different thing from my account of him! If there's anything wrong,yooI swear I'll bring you here myself, but, if it's all right, you go toyoobed. And I'll spend the night here, in the passage, he won't hear me,yooand I'll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady's, to be at hand. Whichyoois better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But theyoolandlady is out of the question; it's all right for me, but it's out ofyoothe question for you: she wouldn't take you, for she's... for she's ayoofool... She'd be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,yootoo, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is anyooabsolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...yooNo matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?"yooyoo"Let us go, mother," said Avdotya Romanovna, "he will certainly do whatyoohe has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor reallyyoowill consent to spend the night here, what could be better?"yooyoo"You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!"yooRazumihin cried in ecstasy, "let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sityoowith him with a light; I'll come in a quarter of an hour."yooyooThough Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made noyoofurther resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them downyoothe stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent andyoogood-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed inyoosuch a condition....yooyoo"Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!" Razumihin broke in uponyooher thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with hugeyoosteps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact heyoodid not observe, however. "Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,yoobut that's not it; I am not drunk from wine. It's seeing you has turnedyoomy head... But don't mind me! Don't take any notice: I am talkingyoononsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! Theyoominute I've taken you home, I'll pour a couple of pailfuls of water overyoomy head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If onlyyooyou knew how I love you both! Don't laugh, and don't be angry! You mayyoobe angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore Iyooam your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last yearyoothere was a moment... though it wasn't a presentiment really, foryooyou seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan't sleep allyoonight... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...yoothat's why he mustn't be irritated."yooyoo"What do you say?" cried the mother.yooyoo"Did the doctor really say that?" asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.yooyoo"Yes, but it's not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, ayoopowder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have beenyoobetter if you had come to-morrow. It's a good thing we went away. And inyooan hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is notyoodrunk! And I shan't be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Becauseyoothey got me into an argument, damn them! I've sworn never to argue! Theyyootalk such trash! I almost came to blows! I've left my uncle to preside.yooWould you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualismyooand that's just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlikeyoothemselves as they can. That's what they regard as the highest point ofyooprogress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is..."yooyoo"Listen!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only addedyoofuel to the flames.yooyoo"What do you think?" shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, "you think Iyooam attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talkyoononsense. That's man's one privilege over all creation. Through erroryooyou come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach anyyootruth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred andyoofourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can't even makeyoomistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,yooand I'll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one's own way is better thanyooto go right in someone else's. In the first case you are a man, in theyoosecond you're no better than a bird. Truth won't escape you, but lifeyoocan be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?yooIn science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,yoojudgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we areyoostill in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on otheryoopeople's ideas, it's what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?" criedyooRazumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies' hands.yooyoo"Oh, mercy, I do not know," cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"Yes, yes... though I don't agree with you in everything," added AvdotyayooRomanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her handyooso painfully.yooyoo"Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you..." he cried inyooa transport, "you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... andyooperfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kissyooyour hands here at once, on my knees..." and he fell on his knees on theyoopavement, fortunately at that time deserted.yooyoo"Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?" Pulcheria Alexandrovnayoocried, greatly distressed.yooyoo"Get up, get up!" said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.yooyoo"Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That's it! Enough! Iyooget up and we'll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you andyoodrunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you, but to doyoohomage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! AndyooI've done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodyayoowas right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! howyoodare he put you in such lodgings! It's a scandal! Do you know theyoosort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You areyoohis betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I'll tell you, your _fiancé_ is ayooscoundrel."yooyoo"Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting..." Pulcheria Alexandrovnayoowas beginning.yooyoo"Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,"yooRazumihin made haste to apologise. "But... but you can't be angry withyoome for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!yooThat would be disgraceful; in fact not because I'm in... hm! Well,yooanyway, I won't say why, I daren't.... But we all saw to-day when heyoocame in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hairyoocurled at the barber's, not because he was in such a hurry to show hisyoowit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flintyooand a buffoon. That's evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is ayoofool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,yooladies?" he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, "thoughyooall my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though weyoodo talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to theyootruth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...yoois not on the right path. Though I've been calling them all sorts ofyoonames just now, I do respect them all... though I don't respect Zametov,yooI like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because heyoois an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it's all said andyooforgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let's go on. I know this corridor,yooI've been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are youyoohere? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.yooDon't let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I'll come back with news,yooand half an hour later I'll bring Zossimov, you'll see! Good-bye, I'llyoorun."yooyoo"Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?" said PulcheriayooAlexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.yooyoo"Don't worry yourself, mother," said Dounia, taking off her hat andyoocape. "God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from ayoodrinking party. We can depend on him, I assure you. And all that he hasyoodone for Rodya...."yooyoo"Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bringyoomyself to leave Rodya?... And how different, how different I had fanciedyooour meeting! How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us...."yooyooTears came into her eyes.yooyoo"No, it's not that, mother. You didn't see, you were crying all theyootime. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that's the reason."yooyoo"Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talkedyooto you, Dounia!" said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,yootrying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia'syoostanding up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgivenyoohim. "I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow," she added,yooprobing her further.yooyoo"And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,"yooAvdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no goingyoobeyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna wasyooafraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latteryoowarmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to waityooanxiously for Razumihin's return, timidly watching her daughter whoyoowalked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.yooThis walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of AvdotyayooRomanovna's and the mother was always afraid to break in on heryoodaughter's mood at such moments.yooyooRazumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuationyoofor Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, manyyoopeople would have thought it justified if they had seen AvdotyayooRomanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to andyoofro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna wasyooremarkably good looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,yoostrong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in everyyoogesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace andyoosoftness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but sheyoomight be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, ayoolittle lighter than her brother's; there was a proud light in her almostyooblack eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She wasyoopale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshnessyooand vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projectedyooa little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautifulyooface, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughtyyooexpression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;yoobut how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,yoolaughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,yoosimple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyoneyoolike her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his headyooimmediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for theyoofirst time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy atyoomeeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignationyooat her brother's insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate wasyoosealed.yooyooHe had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunkenyootalk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov's eccentricyoolandlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as ofyooAvdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna wasyooforty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; sheyoolooked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always theyoocase with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pureyoosincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that toyoopreserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Heryoohair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow'syoofoot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken fromyooanxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Douniayooover again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.yooPulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid andyooyielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept ayoogreat deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was ayoocertain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictionsyoowhich nothing would induce her to cross.yooyooExactly twenty minutes after Razumihin's departure, there came twoyoosubdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.yooyoo"I won't come in, I haven't time," he hastened to say when the door wasyooopened. "He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he mayyoosleep ten hours. Nastasya's with him; I told her not to leave till Iyoocame. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you'dyoobetter turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything...."yooyooAnd he ran off down the corridor.yooyoo"What a very competent and... devoted young man!" cried PulcheriayooAlexandrovna exceedingly delighted.yooyoo"He seems a splendid person!" Avdotya Romanovna replied with someyoowarmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.yooyooIt was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridoryooand another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completelyyoorelying on Razumihin's promise; he actually had succeeded in bringingyooZossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party toyoogo to Raskolnikov's, but he came reluctantly and with the greatestyoosuspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilaratedyoocondition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he sawyoothat they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just tenyoominutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting PulcheriayooAlexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve andyooextreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.yooHe did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display theyooslightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the twoyooladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of AvdotyayooRomanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit andyooaddressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave himyooextraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought theyooinvalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to hisyooobservations the patient's illness was due partly to his unfortunateyoomaterial surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly alsoyooa moral origin, "was, so to speak, the product of several material andyoomoral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...yooand so on." Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following hisyoowords with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on thisyootheme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna's anxiously and timidly inquiring asyooto "some suspicion of insanity," he replied with a composed and candidyoosmile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patientyoohad some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,yoowas now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--butyoothat it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been inyoodelirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would haveyooa favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, "if only allyoofresh shocks can be avoided," he added significantly. Then he got up,yootook leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warmyoogratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovnayoospontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleasedyoowith his visit and still more so with himself.yooyoo"We'll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!" Razumihin said in conclusion,yoofollowing Zossimov out. "I'll be with you to-morrow morning as early asyoopossible with my report."yooyoo"That's a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna," remarked Zossimov,yooalmost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.yooyoo"Fetching? You said fetching?" roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimovyooand seized him by the throat. "If you ever dare.... Do you understand?yooDo you understand?" he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezingyoohim against the wall. "Do you hear?"yooyoo"Let me go, you drunken devil," said Zossimov, struggling and when heyoohad let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.yooRazumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.yooyoo"Of course, I am an ass," he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, "butyoostill... you are another."yooyoo"No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly."yooyooThey walked along in silence and only when they were close toyooRaskolnikov's lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerableyooanxiety.yooyoo"Listen," he said, "you're a first-rate fellow, but among your otheryoofailings, you're a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. Youyooare a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you're getting fatyooand lazy and can't deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty becauseyooit leads one straight into the dirt. You've let yourself get so slackyoothat I don't know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.yooYou--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to youryoopatients! In another three or four years you won't get up for youryoopatients... But hang it all, that's not the point!... You are goingyooto spend to-night in the landlady's flat here. (Hard work I've had toyoopersuade her!) And I'll be in the kitchen. So here's a chance for you toyooget to know her better.... It's not as you think! There's not a trace ofyooanything of the sort, brother...!"yooyoo"But I don't think!"yooyoo"Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savageyoovirtue... and yet she's sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!yooSave me from her, by all that's unholy! She's most prepossessing... I'llyoorepay you, I'll do anything...."yooyooZossimov laughed more violently than ever.yooyoo"Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?"yooyoo"It won't be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,yooas long as you sit by her and talk. You're a doctor, too; try curingyooher of something. I swear you won't regret it. She has a piano, and youyooknow, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: 'Iyooshed hot tears.' She likes the genuine article--and well, it allyoobegan with that song; Now you're a regular performer, a _maître_, ayooRubinstein.... I assure you, you won't regret it!"yooyoo"But have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise ofyoomarriage, perhaps?"yooyoo"Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is notyoothat sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that...."yooyoo"Well then, drop her!"yooyoo"But I can't drop her like that!"yooyoo"Why can't you?"yooyoo"Well, I can't, that's all about it! There's an element of attractionyoohere, brother."yooyoo"Then why have you fascinated her?"yooyoo"I haven't fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.yooBut she won't care a straw whether it's you or I, so long as somebodyyoosits beside her, sighing.... I can't explain the position, brother...yoolook here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... beginyooteaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I'm not joking, I'myooin earnest, it'll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sighyoofor a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a timeyooabout the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--sheyoojust sighed and perspired! And you mustn't talk of love--she's bashfulyooto hysterics--but just let her see you can't tear yourself away--that'syooenough. It's fearfully comfortable; you're quite at home, you canyooread, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if you'reyoocareful."yooyoo"But what do I want with her?"yooyoo"Ach, I can't make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!yooI have often been reminded of you!... You'll come to it in the end! Soyoodoes it matter whether it's sooner or later? There's the feather-bedyooelement here, brother--ach! and not only that! There's an attractionyoohere--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,yoothe navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of theyooworld, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the eveningyoosamovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--asyoosnug as though you were dead, and yet you're alive--the advantagesyooof both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I'm talking, it'syoobedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so I'll go in and look atyoohim. But there's no need, it's all right. Don't you worry yourself,yooyet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you noticeyooanything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there can't be...."yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIyooyooRazumihin waked up next morning at eight o'clock, troubled and serious.yooHe found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.yooHe had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. Heyooremembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectlyyoonovel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impressionyoounlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognisedyooclearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelesslyyoounattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, andyoohe hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficultiesyoobequeathed him by that "thrice accursed yesterday."yooyooThe most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shownyoohimself "base and mean," not only because he had been drunk, butyoobecause he had taken advantage of the young girl's position to abuseyooher _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutualyoorelations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. Andyoowhat right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?yooWho had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature asyooAvdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So thereyoomust be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he knowyoothe character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! howyoodespicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?yooSuch a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and theyootruth had all come out, "that is, all the uncleanness of his coarseyooand envious heart"! And would such a dream ever be permissible toyoohim, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisyyoobraggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynicalyooa juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea andyoosuddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he hadyoosaid last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous ofyooAvdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fistyoodown heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of theyoobricks flying.yooyoo"Of course," he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling ofyooself-abasement, "of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out oryoosmoothed over... and so it's useless even to think of it, and I mustyoogo to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not askyooforgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!"yooyooAnd yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.yooHe hadn't another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn't have put ityooon. "I would have made a point of not putting it on." But in any case heyoocould not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offendyoothe feelings of others, especially when they were in need of hisyooassistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.yooHis linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.yooyooHe washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--heyoowashed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to theyooquestion whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovnayoohad capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the questionyoowas angrily answered in the negative. "Let it stay as it is! What ifyoothey think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would thinkyooso! Not on any account!"yooyoo"And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had theyoomanners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he hadyoosome of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to beyooproud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and allyoothe same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactlyyoodishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and toyooset all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he'dyoomake a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and heyoowouldn't care! He'd be worse!"yooyooHe was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the nightyooin Praskovya Pavlovna's parlour, came in.yooyooHe was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.yooRazumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.yooZossimov gave orders that they shouldn't wake him and promised to seeyoohim again about eleven.yooyoo"If he is still at home," he added. "Damn it all! If one can't controlyooone's patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ willyoogo to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?"yooyoo"They are coming, I think," said Razumihin, understanding the objectyooof the question, "and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.yooI'll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I."yooyoo"But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I've plentyyooto do besides looking after them."yooyoo"One thing worries me," interposed Razumihin, frowning. "On the way homeyooI talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... andyooamongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane."yooyoo"You told the ladies so, too."yooyoo"I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think soyooseriously?"yooyoo"That's nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,yooyourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me toyoohim... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, withyooyour story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,yooperhaps, mad on that very point! If only I'd known what happened thenyooat the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with thisyoosuspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.yooThese monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... andyoosee their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it wasyooZametov's story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, Iyooknow one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throatyooof a little boy of eight, because he couldn't endure the jokes he madeyooevery day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent policeyooofficer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man halfyoofrantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! Thatyoomay well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother ityooall!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, butyoohm... he shouldn't have told all that last night. He is an awfulyoochatterbox!"yooyoo"But whom did he tell it to? You and me?"yooyoo"And Porfiry."yooyoo"What does that matter?"yooyoo"And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?yooTell them to be more careful with him to-day...."yooyoo"They'll get on all right!" Razumihin answered reluctantly.yooyoo"Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn'tyooseem to dislike him... and they haven't a farthing, I suppose? eh?"yooyoo"But what business is it of yours?" Razumihin cried with annoyance. "Howyoocan I tell whether they've a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhapsyooyou'll find out...."yooyoo"Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night's wine has not gone offyooyet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night'syoolodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ throughyoothe door; she was up at seven o'clock, the samovar was taken into heryoofrom the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview...."yooyooAt nine o'clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev'syoohouse. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. Theyyoohad risen at seven o'clock or earlier. He entered looking as black asyoonight, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. Heyoohad reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed atyoohim, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glancedyootimidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at thatyoomoment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, suchyoocomplete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks andyooill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greateryooconfusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was ayoosubject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.yooyooHearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,yooPulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, becauseyoo"she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk overyoobeforehand." Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitationyooto have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. AvdotyayooRomanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, andyoothey asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in suchyooa dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihinyoovigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stoppedyooin embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna'syooquestions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.yooyooHe talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interruptedyooby their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all theyoomost important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov's life,yooconcluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,yoohowever, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene atyoothe police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerlyyooto his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied hisyoolisteners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.yooyoo"Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don't knowyooyour name!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.yooyoo"Dmitri Prokofitch."yooyoo"I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how heyoolooks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what areyoohis likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,yoowhat are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences isyoohe now? In a word, I should like..."yooyoo"Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?" observed Dounia.yooyoo"Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,yooDmitri Prokofitch!"yooyoo"Naturally," answered Razumihin. "I have no mother, but my uncle comesyooevery year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even inyooappearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years' separationyoomeans a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion foryooa year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and ofyoolate--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious andyoofanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not likeyooshowing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open hisyooheart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simplyyoocold and inhumanly callous; it's as though he were alternating betweenyootwo characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he isyooso busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doingyoonothing. He doesn't jeer at things, not because he hasn't the wit, butyooas though he hadn't time to waste on such trifles. He never listensyooto what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests otheryoopeople at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhapsyoohe is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a mostyoobeneficial influence upon him."yooyoo"God grant it may," cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed byyooRazumihin's account of her Rodya.yooyooAnd Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.yooHe glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment andyoolooked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listeningyooattentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with heryooarms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,yoowithout stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening toyoowhat was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had ayoowhite transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs ofyooextreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressedyoolike a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhapsyoojust because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the miseryyooof her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to beyooafraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was veryyootrying for a man who already felt diffident.yooyoo"You've told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother'syoocharacter... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that youyoowere too uncritically devoted to him," observed Avdotya Romanovna withyooa smile. "I think you are right that he needs a woman's care," she addedyoothoughtfully.yooyoo"I didn't say so; but I daresay you are right, only..."yooyoo"What?"yooyoo"He loves no one and perhaps he never will," Razumihin declaredyoodecisively.yooyoo"You mean he is not capable of love?"yooyoo"Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, inyooeverything, indeed!" he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, butyooremembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,yoohe turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. AvdotyayooRomanovna couldn't help laughing when she looked at him.yooyoo"You may both be mistaken about Rodya," Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,yooslightly piqued. "I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.yooWhat Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I haveyoosupposed may be mistaken, but you can't imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, howyoomoody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on whatyoohe would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he mightyoodo something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, foryooinstance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gaveyoome a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying thatyoogirl--what was her name--his landlady's daughter?"yooyoo"Did you hear about that affair?" asked Avdotya Romanovna.yooyoo"Do you suppose----" Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. "Do youyoosuppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death fromyoogrief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly haveyoodisregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn't that he doesn't love us!"yooyoo"He has never spoken a word of that affair to me," Razumihin answeredyoocautiously. "But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,yoothough she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly wasyoorather strange."yooyoo"And what did you hear?" both the ladies asked at once.yooyoo"Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, whichyooonly failed to take place through the girl's death, was not at all toyooPraskovya Pavlovna's liking. They say, too, the girl was not at allyoopretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... andyooqueer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must haveyoohad some good qualities or it's quite inexplicable.... She had no moneyyooeither and he wouldn't have considered her money.... But it's alwaysyoodifficult to judge in such matters."yooyoo"I am sure she was a good girl," Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.yooyoo"God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don't knowyoowhich of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to heryooor she to him," Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she beganyootentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day withyooLuzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously toyoothe latter's annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidentlyyoocaused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it inyoodetail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openlyyooblamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, notyooseeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.yooyoo"He had planned it before his illness," he added.yooyoo"I think so, too," Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.yooBut she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himselfyooso carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.yooAvdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.yooyoo"So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?" Pulcheria Alexandrovnayoocould not resist asking.yooyoo"I can have no other opinion of your daughter's future husband,"yooRazumihin answered firmly and with warmth, "and I don't say it simplyyoofrom vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovnayoohas of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke soyoorudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...yoomad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and thisyoomorning I am ashamed of it."yooyooHe crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did notyoobreak the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they beganyooto speak of Luzhin.yooyooWithout her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know whatyooto do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, sheyooconfessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.yooyoo"You see, Dmitri Prokofitch," she began. "I'll be perfectly open withyooDmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?"yooyoo"Of course, mother," said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.yooyoo"This is what it is," she began in haste, as though the permission toyoospeak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. "Very early thisyoomorning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letteryooannouncing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, youyooknow; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of theseyoolodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he wouldyoobe here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.yooYou'd better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries meyoovery much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candidyooopinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya's character better thanyooanyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tellyooyou, made her decision at once, but I still don't feel sure how to actyooand I... I've been waiting for your opinion."yooyooRazumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and readyooas follows:yooyoo"Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform youyoothat owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you atyoothe railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same objectyooin view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview withyooyou to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit ofyoodelay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while youyooare meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall haveyoothe honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgingsyoonot later than to-morrow evening at eight o'clock precisely, andyooherewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperativeyoorequest that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--asyoohe offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of myyoovisit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desireyoofrom you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanationyooupon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your ownyoointerpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,yoothat if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall beyoocompelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself toyooblame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared soyooill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being ableyooto leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that beliefyooby the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man whoyoowas run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman ofyoonotorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of theyoofuneral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at toyooraise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimableyoodaughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homageyooofyooyoo"Your humble servant,yooyoo"P. LUZHIN."yooyooyoo"What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?" began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,yooalmost weeping. "How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insistedyooso earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered notyooto receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what willyoohappen then?"yooyoo"Act on Avdotya Romanovna's decision," Razumihin answered calmly atyooonce.yooyoo"Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn'tyooexplain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not thatyooit would be best, but that it's absolutely necessary that Rodya shouldyoomake a point of being here at eight o'clock and that they must meet....yooI didn't want even to show him the letter, but to prevent himyoofrom coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is soyooirritable.... Besides I don't understand about that drunkard who diedyooand that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all theyoomoney... which..."yooyoo"Which cost you such sacrifice, mother," put in Avdotya Romanovna.yooyoo"He was not himself yesterday," Razumihin said thoughtfully, "if youyooonly knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though thereyoowas sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going homeyooyesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn't understandyooa word.... But last night, I myself..."yooyoo"The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves andyoothere I assure you we shall see at once what's to be done. Besides,yooit's getting late--good heavens, it's past ten," she cried looking atyooa splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thinyooVenetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of heryoodress. "A present from her _fiancé_," thought Razumihin.yooyoo"We must start, Dounia, we must start," her mother cried in a flutter.yoo"He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our comingyooso late. Merciful heavens!"yooyooWhile she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;yooDounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, wereyoonot merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident povertyyoogave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found inyoopeople who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverentlyyooat Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. "The queen who mended heryoostockings in prison," he thought, "must have looked then every inch ayooqueen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées."yooyoo"My God!" exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "little did I think that Iyooshould ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,yooDmitri Prokofitch," she added, glancing at him timidly.yooyoo"Don't be afraid, mother," said Dounia, kissing her, "better have faithyooin him."yooyoo"Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven't slept all night,"yooexclaimed the poor woman.yooyooThey came out into the street.yooyoo"Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed ofyooMarfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, tookyoomy hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she wereyooblaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don't know, DmitriyooProkofitch, that Marfa Petrovna's dead!"yooyoo"No, I didn't know; who is Marfa Petrovna?"yooyoo"She died suddenly; and only fancy..."yooyoo"Afterwards, mamma," put in Dounia. "He doesn't know who Marfa Petrovnayoois."yooyoo"Ah, you don't know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.yooForgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don't know what I am thinking aboutyoothese last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, andyooso I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as ayoorelation.... Don't be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what's theyoomatter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?"yooyoo"Yes, I bruised it," muttered Razumihin overjoyed.yooyoo"I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds faultyoowith me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whetheryoohe is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,yooyou say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoyyoohim with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I toyootreat him? I feel quite distracted, you know."yooyoo"Don't question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don'tyooask him too much about his health; he doesn't like that."yooyoo"Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are theyoostairs.... What an awful staircase!"yooyoo"Mother, you are quite pale, don't distress yourself, darling," saidyooDounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: "He ought to beyoohappy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so."yooyoo"Wait, I'll peep in and see whether he has waked up."yooyooThe ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when theyyooreached the landlady's door on the fourth storey, they noticed that heryoodoor was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watchingyoothem from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door wasyoosuddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost criedyooout.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIIyooyoo"He is well, quite well!" Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.yooyooHe had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same placeyooas before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,yoofully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been foryoosome time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managedyooto follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.yooyooRaskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition theyooday before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked likeyooa wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.yooHis brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spokeyoolittle and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was ayoorestlessness in his movements.yooyooHe only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to completeyoothe impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. Theyoopale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sisteryooentered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, inyooplace of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the lookyooof suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patientyoowith all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticedyooin him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort ofyoobitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitableyootorture. He saw later that almost every word of the followingyooconversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. Butyooat the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himselfyooand hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like ayoomonomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.yooyoo"Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well," said Raskolnikov,yoogiving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made PulcheriayooAlexandrovna radiant at once. "And I don't say this _as I didyooyesterday_," he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure ofyoohis hand.yooyoo"Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day," began Zossimov, muchyoodelighted at the ladies' entrance, for he had not succeeded in keepingyooup a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. "In another three oryoofour days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,yooas he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has beenyoocoming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has beenyooperhaps your own fault?" he added, with a tentative smile, as thoughyoostill afraid of irritating him.yooyoo"It is very possible," answered Raskolnikov coldly.yooyoo"I should say, too," continued Zossimov with zest, "that your completeyoorecovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,yooI should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid theyooelementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce youryoomorbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will goyoofrom bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don't know, but they mustyoobe known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observedyooyourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangementyoocoincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left withoutyoooccupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, Iyoofancy, be very beneficial."yooyoo"Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return toyoothe university: and then everything will go smoothly...."yooyooZossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect beforeyoothe ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at hisyoopatient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lastedyooan instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thankingyooZossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.yooyoo"What! he saw you last night?" Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.yoo"Then you have not slept either after your journey."yooyoo"Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o'clock. Dounia and I never go toyoobed before two at home."yooyoo"I don't know how to thank him either," Raskolnikov went on,yoosuddenly frowning and looking down. "Setting aside the question ofyoopayment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--Iyooreally don't know what I have done to deserve such special attentionyoofrom you! I simply don't understand it... and... and... it weighs uponyoome, indeed, because I don't understand it. I tell you so candidly."yooyoo"Don't be irritated." Zossimov forced himself to laugh. "Assume that youyooare my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise loveyooour first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall inyoolove with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients."yooyoo"I say nothing about him," added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,yoo"though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble."yooyoo"What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,yooare you?" shouted Razumihin.yooyooIf he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was noyootrace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.yooBut Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watchingyooher brother.yooyoo"As for you, mother, I don't dare to speak," he went on, as thoughyoorepeating a lesson learned by heart. "It is only to-day that I haveyoobeen able to realise a little how distressed you must have been hereyooyesterday, waiting for me to come back."yooyooWhen he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,yoosmiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of realyoounfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed hisyoohand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed heryoosince their dispute the previous day. The mother's face lighted upyoowith ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspokenyooreconciliation. "Yes, that is what I love him for," Razumihin,yooexaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in hisyoochair. "He has these movements."yooyoo"And how well he does it all," the mother was thinking to herself. "Whatyoogenerous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an endyooto all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out hisyoohand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And whatyoofine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even betteryoolooking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terriblyyoohe's dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch's shop, isyoobetter dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--butyooI am afraid.... Oh, dear, he's so strange! He's talking kindly, but I'myooafraid! Why, what am I afraid of?..."yooyoo"Oh, Rodya, you wouldn't believe," she began suddenly, in haste toyooanswer his words to her, "how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Nowyoothat it's all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I canyootell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embraceyooyou and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She toldyoous at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run awayyoofrom the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in theyoostreets. You can't imagine how we felt! I couldn't help thinking of theyootragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father's--youyoocan't remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high feveryooand fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn't pull him outyootill next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point ofyoorushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we wereyooalone, utterly alone," she said plaintively and stopped short,yoosuddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of PyotryooPetrovitch, although "we are quite happy again."yooyoo"Yes, yes.... Of course it's very annoying...." Raskolnikov muttered inyooreply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazedyooat him in perplexity.yooyoo"What else was it I wanted to say?" He went on trying to recollect. "Oh,yooyes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don't think that I didn't meanyooto come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first."yooyoo"What are you saying, Rodya?" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,yoowas surprised.yooyoo"Is he answering us as a duty?" Dounia wondered. "Is he being reconciledyooand asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeatingyooa lesson?"yooyoo"I've only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owingyooto my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash outyoothe blood... I've only just dressed."yooyoo"Blood! What blood?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.yooyoo"Oh, nothing--don't be uneasy. It was when I was wandering aboutyooyesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been runyooover... a clerk..."yooyoo"Delirious? But you remember everything!" Razumihin interrupted.yooyoo"That's true," Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. "Iyooremember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I didyoothat and went there and said that, I can't clearly explain now."yooyoo"A familiar phenomenon," interposed Zossimov, "actions are sometimesyooperformed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of theyooactions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it'syoolike a dream."yooyoo"Perhaps it's a good thing really that he should think me almost ayoomadman," thought Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too," observedyooDounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.yooyoo"There is some truth in your observation," the latter replied. "In thatyoosense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with theyooslight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for weyoomust draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Amongyoodozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with."yooyooAt the word "madman," carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter onyoohis favourite subject, everyone frowned.yooyooRaskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with ayoostrange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.yooyoo"Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!"yooRazumihin cried hastily.yooyoo"What?" Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. "Oh... I got spattered withyooblood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did anyoounpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gaveyooaway all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She'syooa widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,yoostarving... nothing in the house... there's a daughter, too... perhapsyooyou'd have given it yourself if you'd seen them. But I had no right toyoodo it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.yooTo help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,yoochiens, si vous n'êtes pas contents_." He laughed, "That's right, isn'tyooit, Dounia?"yooyoo"No, it's not," answered Dounia firmly.yooyoo"Bah! you, too, have ideals," he muttered, looking at her almost withyoohatred, and smiling sarcastically. "I ought to have considered that....yooWell, that's praiseworthy, and it's better for you... and if you reach ayooline you won't overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,yoomaybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that's nonsense," he addedyooirritably, vexed at being carried away. "I only meant to say that I begyooyour forgiveness, mother," he concluded, shortly and abruptly.yooyoo"That's enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,"yoosaid his mother, delighted.yooyoo"Don't be too sure," he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.yooyooA silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all thisyooconversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in theyooforgiveness, and all were feeling it.yooyoo"It is as though they were afraid of me," Raskolnikov was thinkingyooto himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. PulcheriayooAlexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.yooyoo"Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much," flashed throughyoohis mind.yooyoo"Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead," Pulcheria Alexandrovnayoosuddenly blurted out.yooyoo"What Marfa Petrovna?"yooyoo"Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much aboutyooher."yooyoo"A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she's dead! Oh, really?" he rousedyoohimself suddenly, as if waking up. "What did she die of?"yooyoo"Only imagine, quite suddenly," Pulcheria Alexandrovna answeredyoohurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. "On the very day I was sendingyooyou that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have beenyoothe cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully."yooyoo"Why, were they on such bad terms?" he asked, addressing his sister.yooyoo"Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always veryyoopatient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of theiryoomarried life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. Allyooof a sudden he seems to have lost patience."yooyoo"Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for sevenyooyears? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?"yooyoo"No, no, he's an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!" Douniayooanswered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking intoyoothought.yooyoo"That had happened in the morning," Pulcheria Alexandrovna went onyoohurriedly. "And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to beyooharnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always usedyooto drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I amyootold...."yooyoo"After the beating?"yooyoo"That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as notyooto be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she wasyooundergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, andyooshe used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she gotyoointo the water when she suddenly had a stroke!"yooyoo"I should think so," said Zossimov.yooyoo"And did he beat her badly?"yooyoo"What does that matter!" put in Dounia.yooyoo"H'm! But I don't know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,"yoosaid Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.yooyoo"Ah, my dear, I don't know what to talk about," broke from PulcheriayooAlexandrovna.yooyoo"Why, are you all afraid of me?" he asked, with a constrained smile.yooyoo"That's certainly true," said Dounia, looking directly and sternly atyooher brother. "Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up theyoostairs."yooyooHis face worked, as though in convulsion.yooyoo"Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don't be angry, please, Rodya....yooWhy did you say that, Dounia?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,yoooverwhelmed--"You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in theyootrain, how we should meet, how we should talk over everythingyootogether.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But whatyooam I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happyyoonow--simply in seeing you, Rodya...."yooyoo"Hush, mother," he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, butyoopressing her hand. "We shall have time to speak freely of everything!"yooyooAs he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turnedyoopale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadlyyoochill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible toyoohim that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now beyooable to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able toyoo_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such thatyoofor a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and notyoolooking at anyone walked towards the door.yooyoo"What are you about?" cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.yooyooHe sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They wereyooall looking at him in perplexity.yooyoo"But what are you all so dull for?" he shouted, suddenly and quiteyoounexpectedly. "Do say something! What's the use of sitting like this?yooCome, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....yooCome, anything!"yooyoo"Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginningyooagain," said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.yooyoo"What is the matter, Rodya?" asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.yooyoo"Oh, nothing! I remembered something," he answered, and suddenlyyoolaughed.yooyoo"Well, if you remembered something; that's all right!... I was beginningyooto think..." muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. "It is timeyoofor me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can..." He madeyoohis bows, and went out.yooyoo"What an excellent man!" observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent," Raskolnikovyoobegan, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness heyoohad not shown till then. "I can't remember where I met him before myyooillness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a goodyooman, too," he nodded at Razumihin. "Do you like him, Dounia?" he askedyooher; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.yooyoo"Very much," answered Dounia.yooyoo"Foo!--what a pig you are!" Razumihin protested, blushing in terribleyooconfusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiledyoofaintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.yooyoo"Where are you off to?"yooyoo"I must go."yooyoo"You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don't go.yooWhat's the time? Is it twelve o'clock? What a pretty watch you have got,yooDounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking."yooyoo"It was a present from Marfa Petrovna," answered Dounia.yooyoo"And a very expensive one!" added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady's."yooyoo"I like that sort," said Dounia.yooyoo"So it is not a present from her _fiancé_," thought Razumihin, and wasyoounreasonably delighted.yooyoo"I thought it was Luzhin's present," observed Raskolnikov.yooyoo"No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet."yooyoo"A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to getyoomarried?" he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcertedyooby the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.yooyoo"Oh, yes, my dear."yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.yooyoo"H'm, yes. What shall I tell you? I don't remember much indeed. She wasyoosuch a sickly girl," he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.yoo"Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and wasyooalways dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when sheyoobegan talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember veryyoowell. She was an ugly little thing. I really don't know what drew meyooto her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had beenyoolame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still," heyoosmiled dreamily. "Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium."yooyoo"No, it was not only spring delirium," said Dounia, with warm feeling.yooyooHe fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or didyoonot understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,yoowent up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.yooyoo"You love her even now?" said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.yooyoo"Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that's all now, asyooit were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everythingyoohappening here seems somehow far away." He looked attentively at them.yoo"You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...yoobut, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what's the use ofyooasking about it?" he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fellyoointo dreamy silence again.yooyoo"What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It's like a tomb," saidyooPulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. "Iyooam sure it's quite half through your lodging you have become soyoomelancholy."yooyoo"My lodging," he answered, listlessly. "Yes, the lodging had a greatyoodeal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,yoowhat a strange thing you said just now, mother," he said, laughingyoostrangely.yooyooA little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,yoowith him after three years' absence, this intimate tone of conversation,yooin face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,yoowould have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgentyoomatter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he hadyoodecided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means ofyooescape.yooyoo"Listen, Dounia," he began, gravely and drily, "of course I beg youryoopardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again thatyooI do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am ayooscoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I ceaseyooat once to look on you as a sister."yooyoo"Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again," PulcheriayooAlexandrovna cried, mournfully. "And why do you call yourself ayooscoundrel? I can't bear it. You said the same yesterday."yooyoo"Brother," Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. "In allyoothis there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,yooand found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I amyoosacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case atyooall. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard foryoome. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful toyoomy family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision...."yooyoo"She is lying," he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.yoo"Proud creature! She won't admit she wants to do it out of charity! Tooyoohaughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,yoohow I... hate them all!"yooyoo"In fact," continued Dounia, "I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because ofyootwo evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects ofyoome, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?" She, too,yooflushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.yooyoo"All?" he asked, with a malignant grin.yooyoo"Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch'syoocourtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think tooyoowell of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughingyooagain?"yooyoo"And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You areyoointentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold youryooown against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talkedyoowith him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case youyooare acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it."yooyoo"It is not true. I am not lying," cried Dounia, losing her composure.yoo"I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems meyooand thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmlyyooconvinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincingyooproof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, asyooyou say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on ayoovile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?yooWhy do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? Ityoois despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... Iyooam not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are youyooso pale? Rodya, darling, what's the matter?"yooyoo"Good heavens! You have made him faint," cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"No, no, nonsense! It's nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. Youyoohave fainting on the brain. H'm, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. Inyoowhat way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,yooand that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?"yooyoo"Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch's letter," said Dounia.yooyooWith trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. Heyootook it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly lookedyoowith a sort of wonder at Dounia.yooyoo"It is strange," he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. "Whatyooam I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!"yooyooHe said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked foryoosome time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter atyoolast, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,yooslowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.yooPulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expectedyoosomething particular.yooyoo"What surprises me," he began, after a short pause, handing the letteryooto his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, "is that he is ayoobusiness man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, andyooyet he writes such an uneducated letter."yooyooThey all started. They had expected something quite different.yooyoo"But they all write like that, you know," Razumihin observed, abruptly.yooyoo"Have you read it?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now," PulcheriayooAlexandrovna began, embarrassed.yooyoo"That's just the jargon of the courts," Razumihin put in. "Legalyoodocuments are written like that to this day."yooyoo"Legal? Yes, it's just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,yooand not quite educated--business language!"yooyoo"Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheapyooeducation, he is proud indeed of having made his own way," AvdotyayooRomanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother's tone.yooyoo"Well, if he's proud of it, he has reason, I don't deny it. You seem toyoobe offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on theyooletter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose toyooannoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the styleyoooccurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. Thereyoois one expression, 'blame yourselves' put in very significantly andyooplainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if Iyooam present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandonyooyou both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoningyooyou to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such anyooexpression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) hadyoowritten it, or Zossimov, or one of us?"yooyoo"N-no," answered Dounia, with more animation. "I saw clearly that ityoowas too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skillyooin writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,yooindeed..."yooyoo"It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps heyoointended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expressionyooin the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. Iyoogave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushedyoowith trouble, and not 'on the pretext of the funeral,' but simply to payyoofor the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,yooof notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in myyoolife)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slanderyoome and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legalyoojargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, andyoowith a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to actyoosensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... Iyoodon't think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply toyoowarn you, because I sincerely wish for your good..."yooyooDounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was onlyyooawaiting the evening.yooyoo"Then what is your decision, Rodya?" asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, whoyoowas more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of hisyootalk.yooyoo"What decision?"yooyoo"You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us thisyooevening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?"yooyoo"That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you areyoonot offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, isyoonot offended. I will do what you think best," he added, drily.yooyoo"Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her," PulcheriayooAlexandrovna hastened to declare.yooyoo"I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us atyoothis interview," said Dounia. "Will you come?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o'clock," she said,yooaddressing Razumihin. "Mother, I am inviting him, too."yooyoo"Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided," added PulcheriayooAlexandrovna, "so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not likeyooconcealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... PyotryooPetrovitch may be angry or not, now!"yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IVyooyooAt that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked intoyoothe room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her withyoosurprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recogniseyooher. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday foryoothe first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in suchyooa dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now sheyoowas a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,yooalmost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid butyoosomewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indooryoodress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried ayooparasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not soyoomuch embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like ayoolittle child. She was even about to retreat. "Oh... it's you!" saidyooRaskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at onceyoorecollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin's letteryooof "some young woman of notorious behaviour." He had only just beenyooprotesting against Luzhin's calumny and declaring that he had seen theyoogirl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. Heyooremembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression "ofyoonotorious behaviour." All this passed vaguely and fleetingly throughyoohis brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliatedyoocreature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When sheyoomade a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.yooyoo"I did not expect you," he said, hurriedly, with a look that made heryoostop. "Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.yooAllow me--not there. Sit here...."yooyooAt Sonia's entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one ofyooRaskolnikov's three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her toyooenter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa whereyooZossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served himyooas a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her toyooRazumihin's chair.yooyoo"You sit here," he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.yooyooSonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at theyootwo ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that sheyoocould sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightenedyoothat she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressedyooRaskolnikov.yooyoo"I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you," sheyoobegan falteringly. "I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one toyoosend. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... inyoothe morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...yooto do her the honour... she told me to beg you..." Sonia stammered andyooceased speaking.yooyoo"I will try, certainly, most certainly," answered Raskolnikov. He,yootoo, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.yoo"Please sit down," he said, suddenly. "I want to talk to you. You areyooperhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes," andyoohe drew up a chair for her.yooyooSonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightenedyoolook at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov's pale faceyooflushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.yooyoo"Mother," he said, firmly and insistently, "this is Sofya SemyonovnayooMarmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was runyooover yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you."yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed upyooher eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya's urgent andyoochallenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Douniayoogazed gravely and intently into the poor girl's face, and scrutinisedyooher with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raiseyooher eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.yooyoo"I wanted to ask you," said Raskolnikov, hastily, "how things wereyooarranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?"yooyoo"No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...yoothey did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry."yooyoo"Why?"yooyoo"At the body's remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,yooto-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, untilyooto-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she seesyooherself that it's necessary..."yooyoo"To-day, then?"yooyoo"She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for theyooservice, and then to be present at the funeral lunch."yooyoo"She is giving a funeral lunch?"yooyoo"Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helpingyoous yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral."yooyooAll at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, sheyoocontrolled herself, looking down again.yooyooDuring the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had ayoothin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with ayoosharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, butyooher blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was suchyooa kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not helpyoobeing attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had anotheryoopeculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she lookedyooalmost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, thisyoochildishness seemed almost absurd.yooyoo"But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?yooDoes she even mean to have a funeral lunch?" Raskolnikov asked,yoopersistently keeping up the conversation.yooyoo"The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, soyooit won't cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, soyoothat there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxiousyooit should be so. You know one can't... it's a comfort to her... she isyoolike that, you know...."yooyoo"I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my roomyoolike that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb."yooyoo"You gave us everything yesterday," Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in ayooloud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lipsyooand chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at onceyooby Raskolnikov's poor surroundings, and now these words broke outyoospontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia's eyes,yooand even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.yooyoo"Rodya," she said, getting up, "we shall have dinner together, ofyoocourse. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a littleyoowalk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I amyooafraid we have exhausted you...."yooyoo"Yes, yes, I'll come," he answered, getting up fussily. "But I haveyoosomething to see to."yooyoo"But surely you will have dinner together?" cried Razumihin, looking inyoosurprise at Raskolnikov. "What do you mean?"yooyoo"Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.yooYou do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking himyoofrom you?"yooyoo"Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of diningyoowith us?"yooyoo"Please do," added Dounia.yooyooRazumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were allyoostrangely embarrassed.yooyoo"Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.yooGood-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again."yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failedyooto come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.yooyooBut Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her motheryooout, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gaveyooa hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfortyooin her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna's courtesy and attention wereyoooppressive and painful to her.yooyoo"Dounia, good-bye," called Raskolnikov, in the passage. "Give me youryoohand."yooyoo"Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?" said Dounia, turningyoowarmly and awkwardly to him.yooyoo"Never mind, give it to me again." And he squeezed her fingers warmly.yooyooDounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.yooyoo"Come, that's capital," he said to Sonia, going back and lookingyoobrightly at her. "God give peace to the dead, the living have still toyoolive. That is right, isn't it?"yooyooSonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He lookedyooat her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead fatheryoofloated before his memory in those moments....yooyoo*****yooyoo"Heavens, Dounia," Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were inyoothe street, "I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.yooHow little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be gladyooof that."yooyoo"I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don't you see it?yooPerhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, muchyoocan be forgiven."yooyoo"Well, you were not very patient!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,yoohotly and jealously. "Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. Youyooare the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. Youyooare both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and bothyoogenerous.... Surely he can't be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think ofyoowhat is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!"yooyoo"Don't be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be."yooyoo"Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitchyoobreaks it off?" poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.yooyoo"He won't be worth much if he does," answered Dounia, sharply andyoocontemptuously.yooyoo"We did well to come away," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.yoo"He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and hasyooa breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where isyooone to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-upyoorooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they willyoocrush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, Iyoodeclare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman,yootoo."yooyoo"What young woman, mother?yooyoo"Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now."yooyoo"Why?"yooyoo"I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, butyooas soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chiefyoocause of the trouble...."yooyoo"Nothing of the sort!" cried Dounia, in vexation. "What nonsense, withyooyour presentiments, mother! He only made her acquaintance the eveningyoobefore, and he did not know her when she came in."yooyoo"Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you willyoosee! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I couldyooscarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do youyooremember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like thatyooabout her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a greatyoodeal of her."yooyoo"People will write anything. We were talked about and written about,yootoo. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl, and that ityoois all nonsense."yooyoo"God grant it may be!"yooyoo"And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer," Dounia snapped out,yoosuddenly.yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.yooyoo*****yooyoo"I will tell you what I want with you," said Raskolnikov, drawingyooRazumihin to the window.yooyoo"Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming," Sonia saidyoohurriedly, preparing to depart.yooyoo"One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in ouryooway. I want to have another word or two with you. Listen!" he turnedyoosuddenly to Razumihin again. "You know that... what's his name...yooPorfiry Petrovitch?"yooyoo"I should think so! He is a relation. Why?" added the latter, withyoointerest.yooyoo"Is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?... Youyoowere speaking about it yesterday."yooyoo"Yes... well?" Razumihin's eyes opened wide.yooyoo"He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have someyoopledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake whenyooI left home, and my father's silver watch--they are only worth five oryoosix roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? Iyoodo not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking justyoonow, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia'syoowatch. It is the only thing of father's left us. She would be ill ifyooit were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know Iyooought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not beyoobetter to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matteryoomight be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it beforeyoodinner."yooyoo"Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry," Razumihinyooshouted in extraordinary excitement. "Well, how glad I am. Let us go atyooonce. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him."yooyoo"Very well, let us go."yooyoo"And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance. I haveyoooften talked to him of you at different times. I was speaking of youyooyesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman? So that's it! It is allyooturning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna..."yooyoo"Sofya Semyonovna," corrected Raskolnikov. "Sofya Semyonovna, this is myyoofriend Razumihin, and he is a good man."yooyoo"If you have to go now," Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihinyooat all, and still more embarrassed.yooyoo"Let us go," decided Raskolnikov. "I will come to you to-day, SofyayooSemyonovna. Only tell me where you live."yooyooHe was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided heryooeyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so. They all wentyooout together.yooyoo"Don't you lock up?" asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs.yooyoo"Never," answered Raskolnikov. "I have been meaning to buy a lock foryoothese two years. People are happy who have no need of locks," he said,yoolaughing, to Sonia. They stood still in the gateway.yooyoo"Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me, by theyooway?" he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. Heyoowanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.yooyoo"Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday."yooyoo"Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is your sister?yooDid I give her the address?"yooyoo"Why, had you forgotten?"yooyoo"No, I remember."yooyoo"I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name,yooand he did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name,yooI asked to-day, 'Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?' I did not know youyoohad only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna."yooyooShe was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,yoohurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twentyyoosteps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and thenyoomoving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, toyooremember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had sheyoofelt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world wasyooopening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant toyoocome to her that day, perhaps at once!yooyoo"Only not to-day, please, not to-day!" she kept muttering with a sinkingyooheart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child. "Mercy! toyoome... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!"yooyooShe was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman whoyoowas watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her fromyoothe gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stoodyoostill at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,yoostarted on hearing Sonia's words: "and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikovyoolived?" He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especiallyyooupon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and notedyoothe house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying notyooto betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting foryoosomething. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, andyoothat Sonia was going home.yooyoo"Home? Where? I've seen that face somewhere," he thought. "I must findyooout."yooyooAt the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming theyoosame way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her onyoothe other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtookyooher and kept two or three yards behind her.yooyooHe was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad highyooshoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He woreyoogood and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.yooHe carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at eachyoostep; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant faceyoowith high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.yooHis flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there withyoogrey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.yooHis eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips wereyoocrimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much youngeryoothan his years.yooyooWhen Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons onyoothe pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reachingyoothe house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followedyooher, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the rightyoocorner. "Bah!" muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairsyoobehind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,yooturned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribedyooin chalk, "Kapernaumov, Tailor." "Bah!" the stranger repeated again,yoowondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.yooThe doors were two or three yards apart.yooyoo"You lodge at Kapernaumov's," he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.yoo"He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here atyooMadame Resslich's. How odd!" Sonia looked at him attentively.yooyoo"We are neighbours," he went on gaily. "I only came to town the dayyoobefore yesterday. Good-bye for the present."yooyooSonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt foryoosome reason ashamed and uneasy.yooyoo*****yooyooOn the way to Porfiry's, Razumihin was obviously excited.yooyoo"That's capital, brother," he repeated several times, "and I am glad! Iyooam glad!"yooyoo"What are you glad about?" Raskolnikov thought to himself.yooyoo"I didn't know that you pledged things at the old woman's, too. And...yoowas it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?"yooyoo"What a simple-hearted fool he is!"yooyoo"When was it?" Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. "Two or threeyoodays before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeemyoothe things now," he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuousyoosolicitude about the things. "I've not more than a silver roubleyooleft... after last night's accursed delirium!"yooyooHe laid special emphasis on the delirium.yooyoo"Yes, yes," Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. "Thenyoothat's why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium youyoowere continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that'syooclear, it's all clear now."yooyoo"Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man willyoogo to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _clearedyooup_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must haveyooon all of them!"yooyoo"Shall we find him?" he asked suddenly.yooyoo"Oh, yes," Razumihin answered quickly. "He is a nice fellow, you willyoosee, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polishedyoomanners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligentyoofellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... Heyoois incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, oryoorather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....yooBut he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up ayoocase of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, veryyooanxious to make your acquaintance!"yooyoo"On what grounds is he so anxious?"yooyoo"Oh, it's not exactly... you see, since you've been ill I happen to haveyoomentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... aboutyooyour being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,yoo'What a pity!' And so I concluded... from everything together, not onlyyoothat; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense onyoothe way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,yooof your exaggerating it, you see."yooyoo"What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right," he saidyoowith a constrained smile.yooyoo"Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there wasyoosomething else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense."yooyoo"But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!" Raskolnikov criedyoowith exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.yooyoo"I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One's ashamedyooto speak of it."yooyoo"If you are ashamed, then don't speak of it."yooyooBoth were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikovyooperceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin hadyoojust said about Porfiry.yooyoo"I shall have to pull a long face with him too," he thought, with ayoobeating heart, and he turned white, "and do it naturally, too. But theyoomost natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothingyooat all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, weyooshall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a goodyoothing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart isyoobeating, that's what's bad!"yooyoo"In this grey house," said Razumihin.yooyoo"The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the oldyoohag's flat yesterday... and asked about the blood? I must find that outyooinstantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise... I'llyoofind out, if it's my ruin."yooyoo"I say, brother," he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a slyyoosmile, "I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiouslyyooexcited. Isn't it so?"yooyoo"Excited? Not a bit of it," said Razumihin, stung to the quick.yooyoo"Yes, brother, I assure you it's noticeable. Why, you sat on your chairyooin a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to beyoowrithing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment youyoowere angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You evenyooblushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushedyooawfully."yooyoo"Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?"yooyoo"But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By Jove, thereyoohe's blushing again."yooyoo"What a pig you are!"yooyoo"But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, I'll tell of youyooto-day. Ha-ha-ha! I'll make mother laugh, and someone else, too..."yooyoo"Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you fiend!"yooRazumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. "What willyooyou tell them? Come, brother... foo! what a pig you are!"yooyoo"You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; ayooRomeo over six foot high! And how you've washed to-day--you cleaned youryoonails, I declare. Eh? That's something unheard of! Why, I do believeyooyou've got pomatum on your hair! Bend down."yooyoo"Pig!"yooyooRaskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. Soyoolaughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch's flat. This is whatyooRaskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as theyyoocame in, still guffawing in the passage.yooyoo"Not a word here or I'll... brain you!" Razumihin whispered furiously,yooseizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VyooyooRaskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as thoughyoohe had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind himyooRazumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,yoowith an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face andyoowhole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justifiedyooRaskolnikov's laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,yoobowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the roomyoolooking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, stillyooapparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a fewyoowords to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assumingyooa serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again asyoothough accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:yoohis stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he triedyooto restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin receivedyoothis "spontaneous" mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of mostyoogenuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression asyoothough on purpose.yooyoo"Fool! You fiend," he roared, waving his arm which at once struck ayoolittle round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sentyooflying and crashing.yooyoo"But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it's a loss to the Crown,"yooPorfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.yooyooRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch's,yoobut anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a naturalyooend to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the tableyooand smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed andyooturned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his backyooto the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.yooPorfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, butyooobviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in theyoocorner, but he rose at the visitors' entrance and was standing inyooexpectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise andyooeven it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with ayoocertain embarrassment. Zametov's unexpected presence struck Raskolnikovyoounpleasantly.yooyoo"I've got to think of that," he thought. "Excuse me, please," he began,yooaffecting extreme embarrassment. "Raskolnikov."yooyoo"Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you've comeyooin.... Why, won't he even say good-morning?" Porfiry Petrovitch noddedyooat Razumihin.yooyoo"Upon my honour I don't know why he is in such a rage with me. I onlyyootold him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. Andyoothat was all, I think!"yooyoo"Pig!" ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.yooyoo"There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious atyoothe word," Porfiry laughed.yooyoo"Oh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!" snapped Razumihin, and suddenlyyoobursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a moreyoocheerful face as though nothing had happened. "That'll do! We areyooall fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion RomanovitchyooRaskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to makeyooyour acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business withyooyou. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have youyooknown each other long?"yooyoo"What does this mean?" thought Raskolnikov uneasily.yooyooZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.yooyoo"Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday," he said easily.yooyoo"Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging meyooto introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other outyoowithout me. Where is your tobacco?"yooyooPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, andyootrodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,yoostout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut shortyooand had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. Hisyoosoft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,yoobut had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have beenyoogood-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,yoomawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expressionyooof those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanishyoofigure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed atyoofirst sight.yooyooAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matteryooof business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat downyoohimself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, withyoothat careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive andyooembarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you areyoodiscussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for suchyooexceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikovyooexplained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfiedyoowith himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.yooPorfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,yoositting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,yoolooking from one to the other every moment with rather excessiveyoointerest.yooyoo"Fool," Raskolnikov swore to himself.yooyoo"You have to give information to the police," Porfiry replied, with ayoomost businesslike air, "that having learnt of this incident, that is ofyoothe murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that suchyooand such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...yooor... but they will write to you."yooyoo"That's just the point, that at the present moment," Raskolnikov triedyoohis utmost to feign embarrassment, "I am not quite in funds... andyooeven this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, foryoothe present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I haveyoomoney...."yooyoo"That's no matter," answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving hisyooexplanation of his pecuniary position coldly, "but you can, if youyooprefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of theyoomatter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg..."yooyoo"On an ordinary sheet of paper?" Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, againyoointerested in the financial side of the question.yooyoo"Oh, the most ordinary," and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked withyooobvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking atyoohim. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov's fancy, for it all lasted but ayoomoment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov couldyoohave sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.yooyoo"He knows," flashed through his mind like lightning.yooyoo"Forgive my troubling you about such trifles," he went on, a littleyoodisconcerted, "the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize themyooparticularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I mustyooconfess that I was alarmed when I heard..."yooyoo"That's why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov thatyooPorfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!" Razumihin put inyoowith obvious intention.yooyooThis was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at himyoowith a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediatelyyoorecollected himself.yooyoo"You seem to be jeering at me, brother?" he said to him, with ayoowell-feigned irritability. "I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxiousyooabout such trash; but you mustn't think me selfish or grasping for that,yooand these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told youyoojust now that the silver watch, though it's not worth a cent, is theyooonly thing left us of my father's. You may laugh at me, but my mother isyoohere," he turned suddenly to Porfiry, "and if she knew," he turned againyoohurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, "that theyoowatch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!"yooyoo"Not a bit of it! I didn't mean that at all! Quite the contrary!"yooshouted Razumihin distressed.yooyoo"Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?" Raskolnikov askedyoohimself in a tremor. "Why did I say that about women?"yooyoo"Oh, your mother is with you?" Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"When did she come?"yooyoo"Last night."yooyooPorfiry paused as though reflecting.yooyoo"Your things would not in any case be lost," he went on calmly andyoocoldly. "I have been expecting you here for some time."yooyooAnd as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offeredyoothe ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ashyooover the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to beyoolooking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin's cigarette.yooyoo"What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?"yoocried Razumihin.yooyooPorfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and onyoothe paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with theyoodate on which you left them with her..."yooyoo"How observant you are!" Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his veryyooutmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenlyyooadded:yooyoo"I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that ityoomust be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all soyooclearly, and... and..."yooyoo"Stupid! Feeble!" he thought. "Why did I add that?"yooyoo"But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn'tyoocome forward," Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.yooyoo"I haven't been quite well."yooyoo"I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distressyooabout something. You look pale still."yooyoo"I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well," Raskolnikov snappedyooout rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger wasyoomounting, he could not repress it. "And in my anger I shall betrayyoomyself," flashed through his mind again. "Why are they torturing me?"yooyoo"Not quite well!" Razumihin caught him up. "What next! He wasyoounconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, asyoosoon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,yooand gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,yoodelirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!"yooyoo"Really delirious? You don't say so!" Porfiry shook his head in ayoowomanish way.yooyoo"Nonsense! Don't you believe it! But you don't believe it anyway,"yooRaskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seemyooto catch those strange words.yooyoo"But how could you have gone out if you hadn't been delirious?"yooRazumihin got hot suddenly. "What did you go out for? What was theyooobject of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you didyooit? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly."yooyoo"I was awfully sick of them yesterday." Raskolnikov addressed Porfiryyoosuddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, "I ran away from them toyootake lodgings where they wouldn't find me, and took a lot of money withyoome. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible oryoodelirious yesterday; settle our dispute."yooyooHe could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were hisyooexpression and his silence to him.yooyoo"In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you wereyooextremely irritable," Zametov pronounced dryly.yooyoo"And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day," put in Porfiry Petrovitch,yoo"that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who hadyoobeen run over."yooyoo"And there," said Razumihin, "weren't you mad then? You gave your lastyoopenny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteenyooor twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but heyooflung away all the twenty-five at once!"yooyoo"Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? Soyoothat's why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I've found ayootreasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an houryoowith such trivialities," he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, withyootrembling lips. "We are boring you, aren't we?"yooyoo"Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how youyoointerest me! It's interesting to look on and listen... and I am reallyyooglad you have come forward at last."yooyoo"But you might give us some tea! My throat's dry," cried Razumihin.yooyoo"Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn't youyoolike... something more essential before tea?"yooyoo"Get along with you!"yooyooPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.yooyooRaskolnikov's thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.yooyoo"The worst of it is they don't disguise it; they don't care to stand onyooceremony! And how if you didn't know me at all, did you come to talkyooto Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don't care to hide that they areyootracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face." He wasyooshaking with rage. "Come, strike me openly, don't play with me like ayoocat with a mouse. It's hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps Iyoowon't allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your uglyyoofaces, and you'll see how I despise you." He could hardly breathe.yoo"And what if it's only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and throughyooinexperience I get angry and don't keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it'syooall unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there isyoosomething about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.yooWhy did he say bluntly, 'With her'? Why did Zametov add that I spokeyooartfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihinyoois sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead neveryoodoes see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Ofyoocourse it's nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upsetyoomy nerves or are they teasing me? Either it's ill fancy or they know!yooEven Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.yooI foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it's myyoofirst visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his backyooto him. They're as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt theyyoowere talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? Ifyooonly they'd make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat heyoolet it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of useyooafterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about lastyoonight! He didn't know of my mother's arrival! The hag had written theyoodate on in pencil! You are wrong, you won't catch me! There are noyoofacts... it's all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn't ayoofact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about theyooflat? I won't go without finding out. What did I come for? But my beingyooangry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that'syooright; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catchyoome. Why did I come?"yooyooAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.yooyooPorfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.yooyoo"Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am outyooof sorts altogether," he began in quite a different tone, laughing toyooRazumihin.yooyoo"Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.yooWho got the best of it?"yooyoo"Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floatedyoooff into space."yooyoo"Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such ayoothing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off."yooyoo"What is there strange? It's an everyday social question," Raskolnikovyooanswered casually.yooyoo"The question wasn't put quite like that," observed Porfiry.yooyoo"Not quite, that's true," Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm andyoohurried as usual. "Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want toyoohear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you toyoohelp me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialistyoodoctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against theyooabnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothingyoomore; no other causes admitted!..."yooyoo"You are wrong there," cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeablyyooanimated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made himyoomore excited than ever.yooyoo"Nothing is admitted," Razumihin interrupted with heat.yooyoo"I am not wrong. I'll show you their pamphlets. Everything with themyoois 'the influence of environment,' and nothing else. Their favouriteyoophrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,yooall crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protestyooagainst and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human natureyoois not taken into account, it is excluded, it's not supposed to exist!yooThey don't recognise that humanity, developing by a historical livingyooprocess, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that ayoosocial system that has come out of some mathematical brain is goingyooto organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in anyooinstant, quicker than any living process! That's why they instinctivelyyoodislike history, 'nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,' and theyyooexplain it all as stupidity! That's why they so dislike the _living_yooprocess of life; they don't want a _living soul_! The living soulyoodemands life, the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is anyooobject of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want thoughyooit smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is notyooalive, has no will, is servile and won't revolt! And it comes in the endyooto their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planningyooof rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,yooindeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--ityoowants life, it hasn't completed its vital process, it's too soon for theyoograveyard! You can't skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes threeyoopossibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduceyooit all to the question of comfort! That's the easiest solution of theyooproblem! It's seductively clear and you musn't think about it. That'syoothe great thing, you mustn't think! The whole secret of life in twoyoopages of print!"yooyoo"Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!" laughedyooPorfiry. "Can you imagine," he turned to Raskolnikov, "six peopleyooholding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as ayoopreliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for ayoogreat deal in crime; I can assure you of that."yooyoo"Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a childyooof ten; was it environment drove him to it?"yooyoo"Well, strictly speaking, it did," Porfiry observed with noteworthyyoogravity; "a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to theyooinfluence of environment."yooyooRazumihin was almost in a frenzy. "Oh, if you like," he roared. "I'llyooprove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to theyooChurch of Ivan the Great's being two hundred and fifty feet high, and Iyoowill prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberalyootendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?"yooyoo"Done! Let's hear, please, how he will prove it!"yooyoo"He is always humbugging, confound him," cried Razumihin, jumping up andyoogesticulating. "What's the use of talking to you? He does all thatyooon purpose; you don't know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday,yoosimply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And theyyoowere delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year heyoopersuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for twoyoomonths. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was goingyooto get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He orderedyoonew clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was noyoobride, nothing, all pure fantasy!"yooyoo"Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes inyoofact that made me think of taking you in."yooyoo"Are you such a good dissembler?" Raskolnikov asked carelessly.yooyoo"You wouldn't have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in,yootoo. Ha-ha-ha! No, I'll tell you the truth. All these questions aboutyoocrime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yoursyoowhich interested me at the time. 'On Crime'... or something of theyoosort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in theyoo_Periodical Review_."yooyoo"My article? In the _Periodical Review_?" Raskolnikov asked inyooastonishment. "I certainly did write an article upon a book six monthsyooago when I left the university, but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_."yooyoo"But it came out in the _Periodical_."yooyoo"And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist, so that's why it wasn'tyooprinted at the time."yooyoo"That's true; but when it ceased to exist, the _Weekly Review_ wasyooamalgamated with the _Periodical_, and so your article appeared twoyoomonths ago in the latter. Didn't you know?"yooyooRaskolnikov had not known.yooyoo"Why, you might get some money out of them for the article! What ayoostrange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you knowyoonothing of matters that concern you directly. It's a fact, I assureyooyou."yooyoo"Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!" cried Razumihin. "I'llyoorun to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago?yooWhat was the date? It doesn't matter though, I will find it. Think ofyoonot telling us!"yooyoo"How did you find out that the article was mine? It's only signed withyooan initial."yooyoo"I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I knowyoohim.... I was very much interested."yooyoo"I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before andyooafter the crime."yooyoo"Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is alwaysyooaccompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that partyooof your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end ofyoothe article which I regret to say you merely suggested without workingyooit out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there areyoocertain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but haveyooa perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that theyoolaw is not for them."yooyooRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of hisyooidea.yooyoo"What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of theyooinfluence of environment?" Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.yooyoo"No, not exactly because of it," answered Porfiry. "In his article allyoomen are divided into 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary.' Ordinary men haveyooto live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,yoodon't you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right toyoocommit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because theyyooare extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?"yooyoo"What do you mean? That can't be right?" Razumihin muttered inyoobewilderment.yooyooRaskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where theyyoowanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.yooyoo"That wasn't quite my contention," he began simply and modestly. "YetyooI admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,yooperfectly so." (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) "The onlyyoodifference is that I don't contend that extraordinary people are alwaysyoobound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubtyoowhether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that anyoo'extraordinary' man has the right... that is not an official right, butyooan inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certainyooobstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilmentyooof his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).yooYou say that my article isn't definite; I am ready to make it as clearyooas I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. Iyoomaintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not haveyoobeen made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, ayoohundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed haveyoobeen in duty bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men foryoothe sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. Butyooit does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder peopleyooright and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, Iyoomaintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,yoosuch as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all withoutyooexception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, theyyootransgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and heldyoosacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,yooif that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defenceyooof ancient law--were of use to their cause. It's remarkable, in fact,yoothat the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanityyoowere guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great menyooor even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of givingyoosome new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,yooof course. Otherwise it's hard for them to get out of the common rut;yooand to remain in the common rut is what they can't submit to, from theiryoovery nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit toyooit. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. Theyoosame thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for myyoodivision of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge thatyooit's somewhat arbitrary, but I don't insist upon exact numbers. I onlyyoobelieve in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a lawyooof nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,yoomaterial that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who haveyoothe gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,yooinnumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of bothyoocategories are fairly well marked. The first category, generallyyoospeaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they liveyoounder control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their dutyyooto be controlled, because that's their vocation, and there is nothingyoohumiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress theyoolaw; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to theiryoocapacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;yoofor the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of theyoopresent for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for theyoosake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, Iyoomaintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wadingyoothrough blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.yooIt's only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my articleyoo(you remember it began with the legal question). There's no need foryoosuch anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,yoothey punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfilyooquite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set theseyoocriminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more oryooless). The first category is always the man of the present, the secondyoothe man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, theyoosecond move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equalyooright to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive layooguerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!"yooyoo"Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?"yooyoo"I do," Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and duringyoothe whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.yooyoo"And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity."yooyoo"I do," repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.yooyoo"And... do you believe in Lazarus' rising from the dead?"yooyoo"I... I do. Why do you ask all this?"yooyoo"You believe it literally?"yooyoo"Literally."yooyoo"You don't say so.... I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let usyoogo back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on theyoocontrary..."yooyoo"Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in thisyoolife, and then..."yooyoo"They begin executing other people?"yooyoo"If it's necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark isyoovery witty."yooyoo"Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinaryyoopeople from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feelyoothere ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse theyoonatural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn't theyyooadopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn't they wear something, beyoobranded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member ofyooone category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to 'eliminateyooobstacles' as you so happily expressed it, then..."yooyoo"Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other."yooyoo"Thank you."yooyoo"No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise inyoothe first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhapsyoounfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition toyooobedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimesyoovouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,yoo'destroyers,' and to push themselves into the 'new movement,' andyoothis quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very oftenyoounobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovellingyootendencies. But I don't think there is any considerable danger here,yooand you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,yoothey might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run awayyoowith them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, evenyoothis isn't necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are veryyooconscientious: some perform this service for one another and othersyoochastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose variousyoopublic acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifyingyooeffect; in fact you've nothing to be uneasy about.... It's a law ofyoonature."yooyoo"Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; butyoothere's another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many peopleyoowho have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I amyooready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it's alarmingyooif there are a great many of them, eh?"yooyoo"Oh, you needn't worry about that either," Raskolnikov went on in theyoosame tone. "People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity foryoosaying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarilyyooso in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all theseyoogrades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularityyoosome law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I amyooconvinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass ofyoomankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,yooby some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races andyoostocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of ayoothousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--Iyoospeak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and withyoostill greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of geniusyoois one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,yooappear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I haveyoonot peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But thereyoocertainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter ofyoochance."yooyoo"Why, are you both joking?" Razumihin cried at last. "There you sit,yoomaking fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?"yooyooRaskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.yooAnd the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm ofyooPorfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.yooyoo"Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,yooin saying that it's not new, that it's like what we've read and heard ayoothousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and isyooexclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshedyoo_in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with suchyoofanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But thatyoosanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terribleyoothan the official, legal sanction of bloodshed...."yooyoo"You are quite right, it is more terrible," Porfiry agreed.yooyoo"Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it.yooYou can't think that! I shall read it."yooyoo"All that is not in the article, there's only a hint of it," saidyooRaskolnikov.yooyoo"Yes, yes." Porfiry couldn't sit still. "Your attitude to crime isyoopretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence (I amyooreally ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you've removedyoomy anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are variousyoopractical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youthyooimagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--andyoosuppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some greatyooenterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...yoodo you see?"yooyooZametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not evenyooraise his eyes to him.yooyoo"I must admit," he went on calmly, "that such cases certainly mustyooarise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into thatyoosnare; young people especially."yooyoo"Yes, you see. Well then?"yooyoo"What then?" Raskolnikov smiled in reply; "that's not my fault. So it isyooand so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)yoothat I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,yoobanishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There's no need toyoobe uneasy. You have but to catch the thief."yooyoo"And what if we do catch him?"yooyoo"Then he gets what he deserves."yooyoo"You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?"yooyoo"Why do you care about that?"yooyoo"Simply from humanity."yooyoo"If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be hisyoopunishment--as well as the prison."yooyoo"But the real geniuses," asked Razumihin frowning, "those who haveyoothe right to murder? Oughtn't they to suffer at all even for the bloodyoothey've shed?"yooyoo"Why the word _ought_? It's not a matter of permission or prohibition.yooHe will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering areyooalways inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. Theyooreally great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth," he addedyoodreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.yooyooHe raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took hisyoocap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, andyoohe felt this. Everyone got up.yooyoo"Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like," PorfiryyooPetrovitch began again, "but I can't resist. Allow me one littleyooquestion (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion Iyoowant to express, simply that I may not forget it."yooyoo"Very good, tell me your little notion," Raskolnikov stood waiting, paleyooand grave before him.yooyoo"Well, you see... I really don't know how to express it properly....yooIt's a playful, psychological idea.... When you were writing youryooarticle, surely you couldn't have helped, he-he! fancying yourself...yoojust a little, an 'extraordinary' man, uttering a _new word_ in youryoosense.... That's so, isn't it?"yooyoo"Quite possibly," Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.yooyooRazumihin made a movement.yooyoo"And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficultiesyooand hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...yooFor instance, to rob and murder?"yooyooAnd again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just asyoobefore.yooyoo"If I did I certainly should not tell you," Raskolnikov answered withyoodefiant and haughty contempt.yooyoo"No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literaryyoopoint of view..."yooyoo"Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!" Raskolnikov thought withyoorepulsion.yooyoo"Allow me to observe," he answered dryly, "that I don't consider myselfyooa Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not beingyooone of them I cannot tell you how I should act."yooyoo"Oh, come, don't we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?"yooPorfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.yooyooSomething peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.yooyoo"Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for AlyonayooIvanovna last week?" Zametov blurted out from the corner.yooyooRaskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.yooRazumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticingyoosomething. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomyyoosilence. Raskolnikov turned to go.yooyoo"Are you going already?" Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand withyooexcessive politeness. "Very, very glad of your acquaintance. As for youryoorequest, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still,yoocome to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed. I shallyoobe there at eleven o'clock for certain. We'll arrange it all; we'll haveyooa talk. As one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able toyootell us something," he added with a most good-natured expression.yooyoo"You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?" Raskolnikov askedyoosharply.yooyoo"Oh, why? That's not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me.yooI lose no opportunity, you see, and... I've talked with all who hadyoopledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are theyoolast.... Yes, by the way," he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, "Iyoojust remember, what was I thinking of?" he turned to Razumihin, "youyoowere talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I knowyoovery well," he turned to Raskolnikov, "that the fellow is innocent, butyoowhat is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point,yoothis is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn't it?"yooyoo"Yes," answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the veryyoomoment he spoke that he need not have said it.yooyoo"Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn't you see inyooa flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmenyooor at least one of them? They were painting there, didn't you noticeyoothem? It's very, very important for them."yooyoo"Painters? No, I didn't see them," Raskolnikov answered slowly, asyoothough ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was rackingyooevery nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly asyoopossible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. "No, I didn'tyoosee them, and I don't think I noticed a flat like that open.... But onyoothe fourth storey" (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)yoo"I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite AlyonayooIvanovna's.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some portersyoowere carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. Butyoopainters... no, I don't remember that there were any painters, and Iyoodon't think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn't."yooyoo"What do you mean?" Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he hadyooreflected and realised. "Why, it was on the day of the murder theyoopainters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are youyooasking?"yooyoo"Foo! I have muddled it!" Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.yoo"Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!" he addressedyooRaskolnikov somewhat apologetically. "It would be such a great thing foryoous to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight atyoothe flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... Iyooquite muddled it."yooyoo"Then you should be more careful," Razumihin observed grimly.yooyooThe last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw themyooto the door with excessive politeness.yooyooThey went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps theyyoodid not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIyooyoo"I don't believe it, I can't believe it!" repeated Razumihin, trying inyooperplexity to refute Raskolnikov's arguments.yooyooThey were by now approaching Bakaleyev's lodgings, where PulcheriayooAlexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihinyookept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excitedyooby the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly aboutyoo_it_.yooyoo"Don't believe it, then!" answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, carelessyoosmile. "You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing everyyooword."yooyoo"You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h'm...yoocertainly, I agree, Porfiry's tone was rather strange, and stillyoomore that wretch Zametov!... You are right, there was something aboutyoohim--but why? Why?"yooyoo"He has changed his mind since last night."yooyoo"Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would doyootheir utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch youyooafterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless."yooyoo"If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds foryoosuspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,yooin the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long agoyoobesides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--allyooambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out byyooimpudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurtedyooit out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems anyoointelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending toyooknow. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsomeyooexplaining it all. Stop!"yooyoo"And it's insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we haveyoospoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--Iyooam glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,yoothis idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why anyooinsinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only youyooknew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,yoounhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe deliriousyooillness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul toyoospeak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has toyooface some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; andyoothe unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presentedyooby Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stiflingyooatmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a personyoowhere he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--heyoomight well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found ityooall on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,yooRodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,yooand spit a dozen times in all directions. I'd hit out in allyoodirections, neatly too, and so I'd put an end to it. Damn them! Don't beyoodownhearted. It's a shame!"yooyoo"He really has put it well, though," Raskolnikov thought.yooyoo"Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?" he said withyoobitterness. "Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feelyoovexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in theyoorestaurant...."yooyoo"Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, asyooone of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! Andyooas for Zametov..."yooyoo"At last he sees through him!" thought Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Stay!" cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. "Stay! youyoowere wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?yooYou say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you hadyoodone _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...yooand the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even ifyooyou had seen it. Who would own it against himself?"yooyoo"If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I hadyooseen the workmen and the flat," Raskolnikov answered, with reluctanceyooand obvious disgust.yooyoo"But why speak against yourself?"yooyoo"Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices denyyooeverything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developedyooand experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external factsyoothat can't be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, willyoointroduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them anotheryoosignificance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckonyoothat I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give anyooair of truth, and then make some explanation."yooyoo"But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have beenyoothere two days before, and that therefore you must have been there onyoothe day of the murder at eight o'clock. And so he would have caught youyooover a detail."yooyoo"Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time toyooreflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, andyooso would forget that the workmen could not have been there two daysyoobefore."yooyoo"But how could you forget it?"yooyoo"Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are mostyooeasily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that heyoowill be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpleryoothe trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as youyoothink...."yooyoo"He is a knave then, if that is so!"yooyooRaskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he wasyoostruck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagernessyoowith which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all theyoopreceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,yoofrom necessity.yooyoo"I am getting a relish for certain aspects!" he thought to himself.yooBut almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though anyoounexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept onyooincreasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev's.yooyoo"Go in alone!" said Raskolnikov suddenly. "I will be back directly."yooyoo"Where are you going? Why, we are just here."yooyoo"I can't help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them."yooyoo"Say what you like, I will come with you."yooyoo"You, too, want to torture me!" he screamed, with such bitteryooirritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin's hands dropped.yooHe stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikovyoostriding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, grittingyoohis teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiryyoolike a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure PulcheriayooAlexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.yooyooWhen Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he wasyoobreathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into hisyoounlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terroryoohe rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had putyoothe things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in theyoohole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got upyooand drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev's, heyoosuddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paperyooin which they had been wrapped with the old woman's handwriting on it,yoomight somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and thenyoomight suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.yooyooHe stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, halfyoosenseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and wentyooquietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamilyyoothrough the gateway.yooyoo"Here he is himself," shouted a loud voice.yooyooHe raised his head.yooyooThe porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointingyoohim out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coatyooand a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. Heyoostooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkledyooflabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat andyoothey looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.yooyoo"What is it?" Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.yooyooThe man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at himyooattentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of theyoogate into the street without saying a word.yooyoo"What is it?" cried Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned youryooname and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out andyoohe went away. It's funny."yooyooThe porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and afteryoowondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.yooyooRaskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight ofyoohim walking along the other side of the street with the same even,yoodeliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though inyoomeditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.yooAt last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The manyoonoticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;yooand so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.yooyoo"You were inquiring for me... of the porter?" Raskolnikov said at last,yoobut in a curiously quiet voice.yooyooThe man made no answer; he didn't even look at him. Again they were bothyoosilent.yooyoo"Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What's theyoomeaning of it?"yooyooRaskolnikov's voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the wordsyooclearly.yooyooThe man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look atyooRaskolnikov.yooyoo"Murderer!" he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.yooyooRaskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, ayoocold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still foryooa moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. Soyoothey walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.yooyooThe man did not look at him.yooyoo"What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?" mutteredyooRaskolnikov hardly audibly.yooyoo"_You_ are a murderer," the man answered still more articulately andyooemphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he lookedyoostraight into Raskolnikov's pale face and stricken eyes.yooyooThey had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the leftyoowithout looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing afteryoohim. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him stillyoostanding there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied thatyoohe was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.yooyooWith slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his wayyooback to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his capyooand put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.yooThen he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain heyoostretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.yooyooHe thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, someyooimages without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces ofyoopeople he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he wouldyoonever have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard tableyooin a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigarsyooin some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quiteyoodark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and theyooSunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed oneyooanother, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and triedyooto clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppressionyoowithin him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was evenyoopleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that tooyoowas an almost pleasant sensation.yooyooHe heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes andyoopretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for someyootime in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly intoyoothe room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya'syoowhisper:yooyoo"Don't disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later."yooyoo"Quite so," answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed theyoodoor. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned onyoohis back again, clasping his hands behind his head.yooyoo"Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,yoowhat did he see? He has seen it all, that's clear. Where was he then?yooAnd from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?yooAnd how could he see? Is it possible? Hm..." continued Raskolnikov,yooturning cold and shivering, "and the jewel case Nikolay found behind theyoodoor--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and youyoocan build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is ityoopossible?" He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak heyoohad become. "I ought to have known it," he thought with a bitter smile.yoo"And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up anyooaxe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I didyooknow!" he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at someyoothought.yooyoo"No, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all isyoopermitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army inyooEgypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets offyoowith a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, andyooso _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh butyooof bronze!"yooyooOne sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, theyoopyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker withyooa red trunk under her bed--it's a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch toyoodigest! How can they digest it! It's too inartistic. "A Napoleon creepyoounder an old woman's bed! Ugh, how loathsome!"yooyooAt moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverishyooexcitement. "The old woman is of no consequence," he thought, hotly andyooincoherently. "The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is notyoowhat matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry toyoooverstep.... I didn't kill a human being, but a principle! I killed theyooprinciple, but I didn't overstep, I stopped on this side.... I wasyooonly capable of killing. And it seems I wasn't even capable of that...yooPrinciple? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They areyooindustrious, commercial people; 'the happiness of all' is their case.yooNo, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; Iyoodon't want to wait for 'the happiness of all.' I want to live myself,yooor else better not live at all. I simply couldn't pass by my motheryoostarving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for theyoo'happiness of all.' I am putting my little brick into the happiness ofyooall and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I onlyyoolive once, I too want.... Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothingyoomore," he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. "Yes, I am certainly ayoolouse," he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playingyoowith it with vindictive pleasure. "In the first place, because I canyooreason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have beenyootroubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not foryoomy own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and nobleyooobject--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly asyoopossible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I pickedyooout the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as Iyooneeded for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have goneyooto a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that Iyooam utterly a louse," he added, grinding his teeth, "is that I amyooperhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I feltyoobeforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Canyooanything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! Theyooabjectness! I understand the 'prophet' with his sabre, on his steed:yooAllah commands and 'trembling' creation must obey! The 'prophet' isyooright, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows upyoothe innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! It's for you toyooobey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that's not foryooyou!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!"yooyooHis hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, hisyooeyes were fixed on the ceiling.yooyoo"Mother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hateyoothem, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can't bear them near me....yooI went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace heryooand think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That's just whatyooI might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am," he added, strainingyoohimself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. "Ah, how I hateyoothe old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!yooPoor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It's strange though, why is ityooI scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn't killed her? Lizaveta!yooSonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don'tyoothey weep? Why don't they moan? They give up everything... their eyesyooare soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia!"yooyooHe lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn't rememberyoohow he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallenyooand the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was ayoopeculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in theyoostreet; workmen and business people were making their way home; otheryoopeople had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust andyoostagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he wasyoodistinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to doyoosomething in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly heyoostood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,yoobeckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned andyoowalked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign toyoohim. "Stay, did he really beckon?" Raskolnikov wondered, but he triedyooto overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him andyoowas frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the longyoocoat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;yoothey went down a turning; the man still did not look round. "Does heyooknow I am following him?" thought Raskolnikov. The man went into theyoogateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked inyooto see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yardyoothe man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov atyooonce followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must haveyoogone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heardyooslow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangelyyoofamiliar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shoneyoothrough the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then heyooreached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters wereyooat work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The stepsyooof the man above had died away. "So he must have stopped or hiddenyoosomewhere." He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was ayoostillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his ownyoofootsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must beyoohiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, heyoohesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, asyoothough everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlouryoowhich was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, theyoochairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in theyooframes. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.yoo"It's the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery," thoughtyooRaskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the moreyoosilent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it wasyoopainful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharpyoocrack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A flyyooflew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. Atyoothat moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the littleyoocupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. "Why is that cloakyoohere?" he thought, "it wasn't there before...." He went up to it quietlyyooand felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously movedyoothe cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bentyoodouble so that he couldn't see her face; but it was she. He stood overyooher. "She is afraid," he thought. He stealthily took the axe from theyoonoose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strangeyooto say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He wasyoofrightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,yoobent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped upyoointo her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the oldyoowoman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doingyooher utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the dooryoofrom the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter andyoowhispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting theyooold woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axeyoothe laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the oldyoowoman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but theyoopassage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on theyoolanding, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows ofyooheads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.yooSomething gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, theyyoowould not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.yooyooHe drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:yoohis door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in theyoodoorway watching him intently.yooyooRaskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed themyooagain. He lay on his back without stirring.yooyoo"Is it still a dream?" he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardlyyooperceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watchingyoohim.yooyooHe stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door afteryoohim, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes onyooRaskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; heyooput his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his caneyooand his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to waityooindefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolenyooglances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almostyoowhitish beard.yooyooTen minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. Thereyoowas complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.yooOnly a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It wasyoounbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.yooyoo"Come, tell me what you want."yooyoo"I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending," the stranger answeredyoooddly, laughing calmly. "Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me toyoointroduce myself...."yooyooyooyooyooPART IVyooyooyooyooCHAPTER Iyooyoo"Can this be still a dream?" Raskolnikov thought once more.yooyooHe looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.yooyoo"Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can't be!" he said at last aloud inyoobewilderment.yooyooHis visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.yooyoo"I've come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I wanted to makeyooyour personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal aboutyooyou that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hopeyoothat you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning theyoowelfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support sheyoomight not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,yoobut with your assistance I reckon on..."yooyoo"You reckon wrongly," interrupted Raskolnikov.yooyoo"They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?"yooyooRaskolnikov made no reply.yooyoo"It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well,yoolet me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don't consider it necessaryyooto justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularlyyoocriminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,yoowith common sense?"yooyooRaskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.yooyoo"That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and 'insulted heryoowith my infamous proposals'--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) Butyooyou've only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in ayooword, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (whichyoodoes not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in theyoomost natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myselfyooa victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of myyoopassion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherishedyoothe deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promotingyooour mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,yooprobably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!"yooyoo"But that's not the point," Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. "It'syoosimply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. We don'tyoowant to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!"yooyooSvidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.yooyoo"But you're... but there's no getting round you," he said, laughing inyoothe frankest way. "I hoped to get round you, but you took up the rightyooline at once!"yooyoo"But you are trying to get round me still!"yooyoo"What of it? What of it?" cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly. "But thisyoois what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form ofyoodeception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, Iyoorepeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except foryoowhat happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna..."yooyoo"You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?" Raskolnikovyoointerrupted rudely.yooyoo"Oh, you've heard that, too, then? You'd be sure to, though.... Butyooas for your question, I really don't know what to say, though my ownyooconscience is quite at rest on that score. Don't suppose that I am inyooany apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medicalyooinquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavyyoodinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothingyooelse. But I'll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, onyoomy way here in the train, especially: didn't I contribute to all that...yoocalamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of theyoosort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of theyooquestion."yooyooRaskolnikov laughed.yooyoo"I wonder you trouble yourself about it!"yooyoo"But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her just twiceyoowith a switch--there were no marks even... don't regard me as a cynic,yooplease; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;yoobut I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleasedyooat my, so to say, warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out toyoothe last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced toyoosit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides,yooshe had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading theyooletter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Heryoofirst act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speakyooof the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to beyooinsulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instancesyooof it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love toyoobe insulted, have you noticed that? But it's particularly so with women.yooOne might even say it's their only amusement."yooyooAt one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and soyoofinishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudenceyoomade him linger for a moment.yooyoo"You are fond of fighting?" he asked carelessly.yooyoo"No, not very," Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. "And Marfa Petrovna andyooI scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she was alwaysyoopleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (notyoocounting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The firstyootime, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in theyoocountry, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did youyoosuppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?yooHa, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few yearsyooago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I've forgottenyoohis name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for havingyoothrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was inyoothose days, that very year I believe, the 'disgraceful action of theyoo_Age_' took place (you know, 'The Egyptian Nights,' that public reading,yooyou remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,yoowhere are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,yooI feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is thereyoofor sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provokingyoo'Germans' that I don't believe there is a progressive who could quiteyooanswer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of viewyoothen, but that's the truly humane point of view, I assure you."yooyooAfter saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.yooRaskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in hisyoomind and able to keep it to himself.yooyoo"I expect you've not talked to anyone for some days?" he asked.yooyoo"Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such anyooadaptable man?"yooyoo"No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man."yooyoo"Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is thatyooit? But why take offence? As you asked, so I answered," he replied,yoowith a surprising expression of simplicity. "You know, there'syoohardly anything I take interest in," he went on, as it were dreamily,yoo"especially now, I've nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty toyooimagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly asyooI told you I want to see your sister about something. But I'll confessyoofrankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I amyoodelighted to see you.... Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but youyooseem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, there'syoosomething wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,yoobut now, generally.... Well, well, I won't, I won't, don't scowl! I amyoonot such a bear, you know, as you think."yooyooRaskolnikov looked gloomily at him.yooyoo"You are not a bear, perhaps, at all," he said. "I fancy indeed thatyooyou are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion toyoobehave like one."yooyoo"I am not particularly interested in anyone's opinion," Svidrigaïlovyooanswered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, "and therefore whyyoonot be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for ouryooclimate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way," heyooadded, laughing again.yooyoo"But I've heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, 'notyoowithout connections.' What can you want with me, then, unless you'veyoosome special object?"yooyoo"That's true that I have friends here," Svidrigaïlov admitted, notyooreplying to the chief point. "I've met some already. I've been loungingyooabout for the last three days, and I've seen them, or they've seen me.yooThat's a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a pooryooman; the emancipation of the serfs hasn't affected me; my propertyyooconsists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has notyoofallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them longyooago. I've been here three days and have called on no one.... What a townyooit is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town ofyooofficials and students of all sorts. Yes, there's a great deal I didn'tyoonotice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My onlyyoohope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!"yooyoo"Anatomy?"yooyoo"But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,yoomaybe--well, all that can go on without me," he went on, again withoutyoonoticing the question. "Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?"yooyoo"Why, have you been a card-sharper then?"yooyoo"How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the bestyoosociety, eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding,yooyou know, poets, men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russianyoosociety the best manners are found among those who've been thrashed,yoohave you noticed that? I've deteriorated in the country. But I did getyoointo prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. ThenyooMarfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off foryoothirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were unitedyooin lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.yooYou know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. Foryooseven years I never left the country. And, take note, that all my lifeyooshe held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, soyooif I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped atyooonce! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible inyoothat."yooyoo"If it hadn't been for that, would you have given her the slip?"yooyoo"I don't know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. Iyoodidn't want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to goyooabroad, seeing I was bored, but I've been abroad before, and alwaysyoofelt sick there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, theyoosea--you look at them and it makes you sad. What's most revolting isyoothat one is really sad! No, it's better at home. Here at least oneyooblames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have goneyooperhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _j'ai le vinyoomauvais_ and hate drinking, and there's nothing left but wine. I haveyootried it. But, I say, I've been told Berg is going up in a great balloonyoonext Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at ayoofee. Is it true?"yooyoo"Why, would you go up?"yooyoo"I... No, oh, no," muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep inyoothought.yooyoo"What does he mean? Is he in earnest?" Raskolnikov wondered.yooyoo"No, the document didn't restrain me," Svidrigaïlov went on,yoomeditatively. "It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearlyyooa year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-dayyooand made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too. She had ayoofortune, you know. 'You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch'--thatyoowas actually her expression. You don't believe she used it? But doyooyou know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in theyooneighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved,yoobut afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying."yooyoo"You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?"yooyoo"Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do youyoobelieve in ghosts?"yooyoo"What ghosts?"yooyoo"Why, ordinary ghosts."yooyoo"Do you believe in them?"yooyoo"Perhaps not, _pour vous plaire_.... I wouldn't say no exactly."yooyoo"Do you see them, then?"yooyooSvidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.yooyoo"Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me," he said, twisting his mouthyoointo a strange smile.yooyoo"How do you mean 'she is pleased to visit you'?"yooyoo"She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of theyoofuneral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left toyoocome here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, onyoothe journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was twoyoohours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone."yooyoo"Were you awake?"yooyoo"Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me foryooa minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hearyooher."yooyoo"What made me think that something of the sort must be happening toyooyou?" Raskolnikov said suddenly.yooyooAt the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was muchyooexcited.yooyoo"What! Did you think so?" Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment. "Did youyooreally? Didn't I say that there was something in common between us, eh?"yooyoo"You never said so!" Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.yooyoo"Didn't I?"yooyoo"No!"yooyoo"I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,yoopretending, I said to myself at once, 'Here's the man.'"yooyoo"What do you mean by 'the man?' What are you talking about?" criedyooRaskolnikov.yooyoo"What do I mean? I really don't know...." Svidrigaïlov mutteredyooingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.yooyooFor a minute they were silent. They stared in each other's faces.yooyoo"That's all nonsense!" Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. "What does sheyoosay when she comes to you?"yooyoo"She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--manyoois a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (Iyoowas tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunchyooafterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar andyoobegan to think), she came in at the door. 'You've been so busy to-day,yooArkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,'yooshe said. All those seven years I've wound that clock every week, and ifyooI forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my wayyoohere. I got out at the station at daybreak; I'd been asleep, tired out,yoowith my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up andyoothere was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack ofyoocards in her hands. 'Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, ArkadyyooIvanovitch?' She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall neveryooforgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,yoobesides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after ayoomiserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a suddenyooMarfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dressyoowith a long train. 'Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like myyoodress? Aniska can't make like this.' (Aniska was a dressmaker in theyoocountry, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, ayoopretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,yooand then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. 'I wonderyooyou trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.' 'Goodyoogracious, you won't let one disturb you about anything!' To tease heryooI said, 'I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.' 'That's just like you,yooArkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for ayoobride when you've hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a goodyoochoice, at least, but I know it won't be for your happiness or hers, youyoowill only be a laughing-stock to all good people.' Then she went out andyooher train seemed to rustle. Isn't it nonsense, eh?"yooyoo"But perhaps you are telling lies?" Raskolnikov put in.yooyoo"I rarely lie," answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently notyoonoticing the rudeness of the question.yooyoo"And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?"yooyoo"Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I hadyooa serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting 'Filka, myyoopipe!' He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I satyoostill and thought 'he is doing it out of revenge,' because we had ayooviolent quarrel just before his death. 'How dare you come in with a holeyooin your elbow?' I said. 'Go away, you scamp!' He turned and went out,yooand never came again. I didn't tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wantedyooto have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed."yooyoo"You should go to a doctor."yooyoo"I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don't knowyoowhat's wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn'tyooask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether youyoobelieve that they exist."yooyoo"No, I won't believe it!" Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.yooyoo"What do people generally say?" muttered Svidrigaïlov, as thoughyoospeaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. "They say, 'Youyooare ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.' But that's notyoostrictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but thatyooonly proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not thatyoothey don't exist."yooyoo"Nothing of the sort," Raskolnikov insisted irritably.yooyoo"No? You don't think so?" Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at himyoodeliberately. "But what do you say to this argument (help me withyooit): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, theyoobeginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to seeyoothem, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for theyoosake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soonyooas one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism isyoobroken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and theyoomore seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one's contact with thatyooother world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into thatyooworld. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, youyoocould believe in that, too."yooyoo"I don't believe in a future life," said Raskolnikov.yooyooSvidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.yooyoo"And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,"yoohe said suddenly.yooyoo"He is a madman," thought Raskolnikov.yooyoo"We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,yoosomething vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, whatyooif it's one little room, like a bath house in the country, blackyooand grimy and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is? Iyoosometimes fancy it like that."yooyoo"Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting thanyoothat?" Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.yooyoo"Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you knowyooit's what I would certainly have made it," answered Svidrigaïlov, with ayoovague smile.yooyooThis horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlovyooraised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.yooyoo"Only think," he cried, "half an hour ago we had never seen each other,yoowe regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled betweenyoous; we've thrown it aside, and away we've gone into the abstract! Wasn'tyooI right in saying that we were birds of a feather?"yooyoo"Kindly allow me," Raskolnikov went on irritably, "to ask you to explainyoowhy you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,yooI have no time to waste. I want to go out."yooyoo"By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going toyoobe married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?"yooyoo"Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioningyooher name? I can't understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,yooif you really are Svidrigaïlov."yooyoo"Why, but I've come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioningyooher?"yooyoo"Very good, speak, but make haste."yooyoo"I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.yooLuzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have onlyyooseen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is noyoomatch for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificingyooherself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake ofyooher family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be veryyooglad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldlyyooadvantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it."yooyoo"All this is very naïve... excuse me, I should have said impudent onyooyour part," said Raskolnikov.yooyoo"You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don't be uneasy, RodionyooRomanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not haveyoospoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess somethingyoopsychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love foryooAvdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell youyoothat I've no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonderyoomyself indeed, for I really did feel something..."yooyoo"Through idleness and depravity," Raskolnikov put in.yooyoo"I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualitiesyoothat even I could not help being impressed by them. But that's allyoononsense, as I see myself now."yooyoo"Have you seen that long?"yooyoo"I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it theyooday before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. Iyoostill fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get AvdotyayooRomanovna's hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin."yooyoo"Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the objectyooof your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out..."yooyoo"With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on ayoocertain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminaryyooarrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well providedyoofor; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I shouldyoomake, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a yearyooago. That's enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.yooBefore the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.yooIt's not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelledyoowith Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.yooI want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if youyoolike in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place sheyoowill never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, beggingyooher pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of tenyoothousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture toyoowhich I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the wayyooto it."yooyoo"You are certainly mad," cried Raskolnikov not so much angered asyooastonished. "How dare you talk like that!"yooyoo"I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am notyoorich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely noyooneed for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall wasteyooit in some more foolish way. That's the first thing. Secondly, myyooconscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.yooYou may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you willyooknow. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom Iyoogreatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerelyyooregretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for theyoounpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to showyoothat I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If thereyoowere a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should notyoohave made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousandyooonly, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,yoovery soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicionyooof any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say thatyooin marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only fromyooanother man. Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coollyyooand quietly."yooyooSvidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was sayingyoothis.yooyoo"I beg you to say no more," said Raskolnikov. "In any case this isyoounpardonable impertinence."yooyoo"Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbouryooin this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of goodyooby trivial conventional formalities. That's absurd. If I died, foryooinstance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely sheyoowouldn't refuse it?"yooyoo"Very likely she would."yooyoo"Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though tenyoothousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case Iyoobeg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna."yooyoo"No, I won't."yooyoo"In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see heryoomyself and worry her by doing so."yooyoo"And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?"yooyoo"I don't know really what to say. I should like very much to see heryooonce more."yooyoo"Don't hope for it."yooyoo"I'm sorry. But you don't know me. Perhaps we may become betteryoofriends."yooyoo"You think we may become friends?"yooyoo"And why not?" Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up and took his hat.yoo"I didn't quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoningyooon it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning."yooyoo"Where did you see me this morning?" Raskolnikov asked uneasily.yooyoo"I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about youyoolike me.... But don't be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get onyooall right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a greatyoopersonage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write aboutyooRaphael's _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov's album, and I never left MarfayooPetrovna's side for seven years, and I used to stay the night atyooViazemsky's house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up inyooa balloon with Berg, perhaps."yooyoo"Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?"yooyoo"What travels?"yooyoo"Why, on that 'journey'; you spoke of it yourself."yooyoo"A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that's a wideyoosubject.... if only you knew what you are asking," he added, and gaveyooa sudden, loud, short laugh. "Perhaps I'll get married instead of theyoojourney. They're making a match for me."yooyoo"Here?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"How have you had time for that?"yooyoo"But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly begyooit. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something.yooTell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna rememberedyooher in her will and left her three thousand roubles. That's absolutelyyoocertain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it wasyoodone in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the moneyyooin two or three weeks."yooyoo"Are you telling the truth?"yooyoo"Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near you."yooyooAs he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIyooyooIt was nearly eight o'clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev's,yooto arrive before Luzhin.yooyoo"Why, who was that?" asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in theyoostreet.yooyoo"It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister wasyooinsulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her withyoohis attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. ThisyooMarfa Petrovna begged Dounia's forgiveness afterwards, and she's justyoodied suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don'tyooknow why I'm afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wife'syoofuneral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... Weyoomust guard Dounia from him... that's what I wanted to tell you, do youyoohear?"yooyoo"Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya,yoofor speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her. Where doesyoohe live?"yooyoo"I don't know."yooyoo"Why didn't you ask? What a pity! I'll find out, though."yooyoo"Did you see him?" asked Raskolnikov after a pause.yooyoo"Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well."yooyoo"You did really see him? You saw him clearly?" Raskolnikov insisted.yooyoo"Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I haveyooa good memory for faces."yooyooThey were silent again.yooyoo"Hm!... that's all right," muttered Raskolnikov. "Do you know, Iyoofancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination."yooyoo"What do you mean? I don't understand you."yooyoo"Well, you all say," Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into ayoosmile, "that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad,yooand have only seen a phantom."yooyoo"What do you mean?"yooyoo"Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything thatyoohappened all these days may be only imagination."yooyoo"Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he say, what didyoohe come for?"yooyooRaskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.yooyoo"Now let me tell you my story," he began, "I came to you, you wereyooasleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry's, Zametov wasyoostill with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn't speak inyoothe right way. They don't seem to understand and can't understand, butyooare not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talkingyooto him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. Atyoolast I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I'dyoobrain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That wasyooall. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn't say a word. But, you see, Iyoothought I'd made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant ideayoostruck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any dangeryooor anything, but why need you care? You needn't care a hang for them. Weyooshall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I'dyoomystify them more than ever. How ashamed they'll be afterwards! Hangyoothem! We can thrash them afterwards, but let's laugh at them now!"yooyoo"To be sure," answered Raskolnikov. "But what will you say to-morrow?"yoohe thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had neveryoooccurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As heyoothought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin's account of his visityooto Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and goneyoosince then.yooyooIn the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctuallyyooat eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went inyootogether without greeting or looking at one another. The young menyoowalked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered ayoolittle in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna cameyooforward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming heryoobrother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though withyooredoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as thoughyoohe were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. PulcheriayooAlexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to makeyoothem all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Douniayooand Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.yooRazumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihinyoowas next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.yooyooA moment's silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out ayoocambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air ofyooa benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved toyooinsist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him toyookeep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharpyooand emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.yooBut he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endureyoouncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been soyooopenly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it wasyoobetter to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them andyoothere would always be time for that.yooyoo"I trust you had a favourable journey," he inquired officially ofyooPulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch."yooyoo"I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatiguedyooeither?"yooyoo"I am young and strong, I don't get tired, but it was a great strain foryoomother," answered Dounia.yooyoo"That's unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.yoo'Mother Russia,' as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all myyoodesire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust allyoopassed off without inconvenience?"yooyoo"Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening," PulcheriayooAlexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, "and ifyooDmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself,yoowe should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri ProkofitchyooRazumihin," she added, introducing him to Luzhin.yooyoo"I had the pleasure... yesterday," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with ayoohostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.yooyooPyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface veryyoopolite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,yoodirectly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, andyoobecome more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.yooAgain all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, AvdotyayooRomanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin hadyoonothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.yooyoo"Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?" she began having recourse toyooher leading item of conversation.yooyoo"To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come toyoomake you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlovyooset off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife's funeral. Soyooat least I have excellent authority for believing."yooyoo"To Petersburg? here?" Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.yooyoo"Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view theyoorapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it."yooyoo"Good heavens! won't he leave Dounia in peace even here?" criedyooPulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyoo"I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds foryoouneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of gettingyoointo communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am nowyoodiscovering where he is lodging."yooyoo"Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you haveyoogiven me," Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: "I've only seen him twice,yoobut I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was theyoocause of Marfa Petrovna's death."yooyoo"It's impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. Iyoodo not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course ofyooevents by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to theyoogeneral conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I amyooin agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, andyooprecisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me withinyooa very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has anyyoopecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He isyoothe most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.yooI have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was soyoounfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight yearsyooago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertionsyooand sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantasticyooand homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced toyooSiberia, was hushed up. That's the sort of man he is, if you care toyooknow."yooyoo"Good heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listenedyooattentively.yooyoo"Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence ofyoothis?" Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.yooyoo"I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I mustyooobserve that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.yooThere was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,yooa foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did otheryoocommissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while closeyooand mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, livingyoowith her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more thanyoofourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; sheyooused to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging inyoothe garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usualyooproceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given thatyoothe child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, thisyoowas not clearly established, the information was given by another Germanyoowoman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statementyoowas actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna's money andyooexertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a veryyoosignificant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you wereyoowith them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment heyooreceived six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom."yooyoo"I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself."yooyoo"Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,yooto suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.yooSvidrigaïlov."yooyoo"I don't know that," answered Dounia, dryly. "I only heard a queer storyyoothat Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,yoothe servants used to say, 'he read himself silly,' and that he hangedyoohimself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov's mockery of him and notyoohis blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and theyyoowere actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him foryooPhilip's death."yooyoo"I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake hisyoodefence all of a sudden," Luzhin observed, twisting his lips intoyooan ambiguous smile, "there's no doubt that he is an astute man, andyooinsinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who hasyoodied so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to beyooof service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewedyooefforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it'syoomy firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor's prison again.yooMarfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anythingyoosubstantial on him, having regard for his children's interests, and,yooif she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,yoosomething insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for ayooman of his habits."yooyoo"Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you," said Dounia, "say no more of Mr.yooSvidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable."yooyoo"He has just been to see me," said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence foryoothe first time.yooyooThere were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even PyotryooPetrovitch was roused.yooyoo"An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, andyoointroduced himself," Raskolnikov continued. "He was fairly cheerfulyooand at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He isyooparticularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, atyoowhich he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, andyoohe told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death MarfayooPetrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and thatyooyou can receive the money very shortly."yooyoo"Thank God!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. "Pray foryooher soul, Dounia!"yooyoo"It's a fact!" broke from Luzhin.yooyoo"Tell us, what more?" Dounia urged Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Then he said that he wasn't rich and all the estate was left to hisyoochildren who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhereyoonot far from me, but where, I don't know, I didn't ask...."yooyoo"But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?" cried PulcheriayooAlexandrovna in a fright. "Did he tell you?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"What was it?"yooyoo"I'll tell you afterwards."yooyooRaskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.yooyooPyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.yooyoo"I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be inyooyour way," he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.yooyoo"Don't go, Pyotr Petrovitch," said Dounia, "you intended to spendyoothe evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have anyooexplanation with mother."yooyoo"Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna," Pyotr Petrovitch answeredyooimpressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. "Iyoocertainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother uponyooa very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openlyyooin my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do notyoodesire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...yooof certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weightyyooand urgent request has been disregarded...."yooyooAssuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.yooyoo"Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting wasyoodisregarded solely at my instance," said Dounia. "You wrote that youyoohad been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained atyooonce, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you,yoothen he _should_ and _will_ apologise."yooyooPyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.yooyoo"There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make usyooforget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;yooand when it has been overstepped, there is no return."yooyoo"That wasn't what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch," Douniayoointerrupted with some impatience. "Please understand that our wholeyoofuture depends now on whether all this is explained and set right asyoosoon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look atyooit in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all thisyoobusiness must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat thatyooif my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness."yooyoo"I am surprised at your putting the question like that," said Luzhin,yoogetting more and more irritated. "Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you,yooI may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some memberyooof your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, Iyoocannot accept duties incompatible with..."yooyoo"Ah, don't be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch," Douniayoointerrupted with feeling, "and be the sensible and generous man I haveyooalways considered, and wish to consider, you to be. I've given you ayoogreat promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believeyoome, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part ofyoojudge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insistedyooon his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I toldyoohim nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are notyooreconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. Thatyoois how the question rests on your side and on his. I don't want to beyoomistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break offyoowith my brother, for my brother's sake I must break off with you. I canyoofind out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want toyooknow it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me,yoowhether you are the husband for me."yooyoo"Avdotya Romanovna," Luzhin declared huffily, "your words are of tooyoomuch consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in viewyooof the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To sayyoonothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with anyooimpertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise toyoome. You say 'you or he,' showing thereby of how little consequence Iyooam in your eyes... I cannot let this pass considering the relationshipyooand... the obligations existing between us."yooyoo"What!" cried Dounia, flushing. "I set your interest beside all that hasyoohitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the _whole_ ofyoomy life, and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account ofyooyou."yooyooRaskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but PyotryooPetrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word heyoobecame more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it.yooyoo"Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought toyoooutweigh your love for your brother," he pronounced sententiously, "andyooin any case I cannot be put on the same level.... Although I said soyooemphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother's presence,yoonevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessaryyooexplanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.yooYour son," he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "yesterday in theyoopresence of Mr. Razsudkin (or... I think that's it? excuse me I haveyooforgotten your surname," he bowed politely to Razumihin) "insulted me byyoomisrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation,yoodrinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has hadyooexperience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point ofyooview than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitableyoofor the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated theyoosignificance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me ofyoomalicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon youryoocorrespondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, PulcheriayooAlexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an oppositeyooconclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me knowyooin what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to RodionyooRomanovitch."yooyoo"I don't remember," faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "I repeated them asyooI understood them. I don't know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhapsyoohe exaggerated."yooyoo"He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation."yooyoo"Pyotr Petrovitch," Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, "theyooproof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense isyoothe fact that we are here."yooyoo"Good, mother," said Dounia approvingly.yooyoo"Then this is my fault again," said Luzhin, aggrieved.yooyoo"Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself haveyoojust written what was false about him," Pulcheria Alexandrovna added,yoogaining courage.yooyoo"I don't remember writing anything false."yooyoo"You wrote," Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, "that Iyoogave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as wasyoothe fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).yooYou wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for thatyooobject added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom youyoodon't know. All that is mean slander."yooyoo"Excuse me, sir," said Luzhin, quivering with fury. "I enlarged uponyooyour qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to youryoosister's and mother's inquiries, how I found you, and what impressionyooyou made on me. As for what you've alluded to in my letter, be so goodyooas to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn'tyoothrow away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in thatyoofamily, however unfortunate."yooyoo"To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the littleyoofinger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones."yooyoo"Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother andyoosister?"yooyoo"I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit down to-dayyoowith mother and Dounia."yooyoo"Rodya!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned, Razumihinyooknitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.yooyoo"You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna," he said, "whether it isyoopossible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end,yooonce and for all. I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasuresyooof family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets." He got up from hisyoochair and took his hat. "But in withdrawing, I venture to requestyoothat for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so toyoosay, compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured PulcheriayooAlexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed toyooyou and to no one else."yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.yooyoo"You seem to think we are completely under your authority, PyotryooPetrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded,yooshe had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you wereyoolaying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours asyooa command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to showyooparticular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrownyooup everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in anyyoocase in a sense in your hands."yooyoo"That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at theyoopresent moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna's legacy, whichyooseems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me," heyooadded sarcastically.yooyoo"Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you wereyooreckoning on our helplessness," Dounia observed irritably.yooyoo"But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desireyoonot to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of ArkadyyooIvanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has entrusted to your brother andyoowhich have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interestyoofor you."yooyoo"Good heavens!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyooRazumihin could not sit still on his chair.yooyoo"Aren't you ashamed now, sister?" asked Raskolnikov.yooyoo"I am ashamed, Rodya," said Dounia. "Pyotr Petrovitch, go away," sheyooturned to him, white with anger.yooyooPyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.yooHe had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in theyoohelplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turnedyoopale, and his lips quivered.yooyoo"Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such ayoodismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back. Consideryoowhat you are doing. My word is not to be shaken."yooyoo"What insolence!" cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. "I don'tyoowant you to come back again."yooyoo"What! So that's how it stands!" cried Luzhin, utterly unable to theyoolast moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out ofyoohis reckoning now. "So that's how it stands! But do you know, AvdotyayooRomanovna, that I might protest?"yooyoo"What right have you to speak to her like that?" Pulcheria Alexandrovnayoointervened hotly. "And what can you protest about? What rights have you?yooAm I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us altogether!yooWe are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I aboveyooall...."yooyoo"But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna," Luzhin stormed in ayoofrenzy, "by your promise, and now you deny it and... besides... I haveyoobeen led on account of that into expenses...."yooyooThis last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, thatyooRaskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,yoocould not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna wasyoofurious.yooyoo"Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But theyooconductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have boundyooyou! What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us,yoohand and foot, not we!"yooyoo"Enough, mother, no more please," Avdotya Romanovna implored. "PyotryooPetrovitch, do be kind and go!"yooyoo"I am going, but one last word," he said, quite unable to controlyoohimself. "Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up myyoomind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spreadyooall over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding publicyooopinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainlyyoomight very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look foryoogratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I seeyoomyself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding theyoouniversal verdict...."yooyoo"Does the fellow want his head smashed?" cried Razumihin, jumping up.yooyoo"You are a mean and spiteful man!" cried Dounia.yooyoo"Not a word! Not a movement!" cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back;yoothen going close up to Luzhin, "Kindly leave the room!" he said quietlyyooand distinctly, "and not a word more or..."yooyooPyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face thatyooworked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any manyoocarried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt againstyooRaskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It isyoonoteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his caseyoowas perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies wereyooconcerned, all might "very well indeed" be set right again.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIIyooyooThe fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such anyooending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming thatyootwo destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. Thisyooconviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit toyoothe point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up fromyooinsignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highestyooopinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloatedyooin solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valuedyooabove all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sortsyooof devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been hisyoosuperiors.yooyooWhen he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her inyoospite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerityyooand had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such "black ingratitude."yooAnd yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of theyoogroundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhereyoocontradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all theyootownspeople, who were warm in Dounia'a defence. And he would not haveyoodenied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highlyyooof his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it asyoosomething heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secretyoofeeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand thatyooothers should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov withyoothe feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his goodyoodeeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, heyooconsidered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.yooyooDounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.yooFor many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he hadyoogone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profoundyoosecret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),yoovery young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, oneyoowho had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one whoyoowould all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire himyooand only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imaginedyooon this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,yoobehold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty andyooeducation of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless positionyoohad been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than heyoodreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of educationyooand breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature wouldyoobe slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, andyoowould humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,yoounbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after longyooreflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career andyoowas now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change hisyoocherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likelyyooto be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortuneyooin Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. Theyoofascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might makeyoohis way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwingyooan aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This suddenyoohorrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like ayoohideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,yoohad not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carriedyooaway--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did loveyooDounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and allyooat once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,yoosmoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksopyoowho was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not helpyoorecalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;yooas though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The manyoohe really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He had, in short, ayoogreat deal to attend to....yooyoo*****yooyoo"No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!" said Dounia, kissing andyooembracing her mother. "I was tempted by his money, but on my honour,yoobrother, I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through himyoobefore, nothing would have tempted me! Don't blame me, brother!"yooyoo"God has delivered us! God has delivered us!" Pulcheria Alexandrovnayoomuttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise whatyoohad happened.yooyooThey were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only nowyooand then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.yooPulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:yooshe had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terribleyoomisfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express hisyoojoy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weightyoohad fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life toyoothem, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid toyoothink of further possibilities and dared not let his imaginationyoorange. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen andyooindifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid ofyooLuzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Douniayoocould not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and PulcheriayooAlexandrovna watched him timidly.yooyoo"What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?" said Dounia, approaching him.yooyoo"Yes, yes!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.yooyooRaskolnikov raised his head.yooyoo"He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desiresyooto see you once in my presence."yooyoo"See her! On no account!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "And how dare heyoooffer her money!"yooyooThen Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation withyooSvidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of MarfayooPetrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.yooyoo"What answer did you give him?" asked Dounia.yooyoo"At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said thatyoohe would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.yooHe assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now heyoohas no feeling for you. He doesn't want you to marry Luzhin.... His talkyoowas altogether rather muddled."yooyoo"How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did he strike you?"yooyoo"I must confess I don't quite understand him. He offers you tenyoothousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, andyooin ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says is he going to beyoomarried and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,yooand probably a bad one. But it's odd that he should be so clumsy aboutyooit if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused thisyoomoney on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him veryyoostrange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;yoothat may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seemsyooto have made a great impression on him."yooyoo"God rest her soul," exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "I shall always,yooalways pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this threeyoothousand! It's as though it had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, thisyoomorning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I wereyoojust planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that manyoountil he offered help."yooyooDounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov's offer. She stillyoostood meditating.yooyoo"He has got some terrible plan," she said in a half whisper to herself,yooalmost shuddering.yooyooRaskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.yooyoo"I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again," he said toyooDounia.yooyoo"We will watch him! I will track him out!" cried Razumihin, vigorously.yoo"I won't lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to meyoohimself just now. 'Take care of my sister.' Will you give me leave, too,yooAvdotya Romanovna?"yooyooDounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did notyooleave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but theyoothree thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.yooyooA quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a livelyyooconversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,yoothough he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.yooyoo"And why, why should you go away?" he flowed on ecstatically. "And whatyooare you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all hereyootogether and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.yooFor a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we'llyooplan a capital enterprise. Listen! I'll explain it all in detail toyooyou, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning,yoobefore anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle, I mustyoointroduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).yooThis uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on hisyoopension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he hasyoobeen bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.yoointerest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last yearyooI had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon asyoohe arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we haveyooenough for a start, so we'll go into partnership, and what are we goingyooto do?"yooyooThen Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at lengthyoothat almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at allyooof what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually badyoopublishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and giveyooa profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, beenyoodreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he hadyoobeen working in publishers' offices, and knew three European languagesyoowell, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he wasyoo"schwach" in German with an object of persuading him to take half hisyootranslation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, andyooRaskolnikov knew he was lying.yooyoo"Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chiefyoomeans of success--money of our own!" cried Razumihin warmly. "Of courseyoothere will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,yooI, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! Andyoothe great point of the business is that we shall know just what wantsyootranslating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all atyooonce. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two yearsyooI've been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know everyyoodetail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believeyoome! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know--and I keptyoothe secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roublesyoosimply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I wouldyoonot take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do youyoothink? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he'd hesitate--they areyoosuch blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,yooyou trust to me, I know my way about. We'll begin in a small way and goyooon to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall getyooback our capital."yooyooDounia's eyes shone.yooyoo"I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!" she said.yooyoo"I know nothing about it, of course," put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna,yoo"it may be a good idea, but again God knows. It's new and untried. Ofyoocourse, we must remain here at least for a time." She looked at Rodya.yooyoo"What do you think, brother?" said Dounia.yooyoo"I think he's got a very good idea," he answered. "Of course, it's tooyoosoon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring outyoofive or six books and be sure of success. I know of one book myselfyoowhich would be sure to go well. And as for his being able to manage it,yoothere's no doubt about that either. He knows the business.... But we canyootalk it over later...."yooyoo"Hurrah!" cried Razumihin. "Now, stay, there's a flat here in thisyoohouse, belonging to the same owner. It's a special flat apart, notyoocommunicating with these lodgings. It's furnished, rent moderate,yoothree rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. I'll pawn your watchyooto-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.yooYou can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But whereyooare you off to, Rodya?"yooyoo"What, Rodya, you are going already?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked inyoodismay.yooyoo"At such a minute?" cried Razumihin.yooyooDounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. He held his cap inyoohis hand, he was preparing to leave them.yooyoo"One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever," heyoosaid somewhat oddly. He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out ayoosmile. "But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see eachyooother..." he let slip accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and ityoosomehow was uttered aloud.yooyoo"What is the matter with you?" cried his mother.yooyoo"Where are you going, Rodya?" asked Dounia rather strangely.yooyoo"Oh, I'm quite obliged to..." he answered vaguely, as though hesitatingyoowhat he would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in hisyoowhite face.yooyoo"I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother,yooand you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. Iyoofeel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come ofyoomyself... when it's possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me,yooleave me alone. I decided this even before... I'm absolutely resolved onyooit. Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to beyooalone. Forget me altogether, it's better. Don't inquire about me. WhenyooI can, I'll come of myself or... I'll send for you. Perhaps it will allyoocome back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin toyoohate you, I feel it.... Good-bye!"yooyoo"Good God!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his mother and his sisteryoowere terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also.yooyoo"Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!" cried hisyoopoor mother.yooyooHe turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Douniayooovertook him.yooyoo"Brother, what are you doing to mother?" she whispered, her eyesyooflashing with indignation.yooyooHe looked dully at her.yooyoo"No matter, I shall come.... I'm coming," he muttered in an undertone,yooas though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out ofyoothe room.yooyoo"Wicked, heartless egoist!" cried Dounia.yooyoo"He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don't you see it? You'reyooheartless after that!" Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezingyooher hand tightly. "I shall be back directly," he shouted to theyoohorror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room.yooyooRaskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.yooyoo"I knew you would run after me," he said. "Go back to them--be withyoothem... be with them to-morrow and always.... I... perhaps I shallyoocome... if I can. Good-bye."yooyooAnd without holding out his hand he walked away.yooyoo"But where are you going? What are you doing? What's the matter withyooyou? How can you go on like this?" Razumihin muttered, at his wits' end.yooyooRaskolnikov stopped once more.yooyoo"Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.yooDon't come to see me. Maybe I'll come here.... Leave me, but _don'tyooleave_ them. Do you understand me?"yooyooIt was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For ayoominute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin rememberedyoothat minute all his life. Raskolnikov's burning and intent eyesyoogrew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into hisyooconsciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as ityoowere, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,yoosomething awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....yooRazumihin turned pale.yooyoo"Do you understand now?" said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously.yoo"Go back, go to them," he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he wentyooout of the house.yooyooI will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,yoohow he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in hisyooillness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come everyyooday, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,yoothat he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, theyoobest doctor, a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin tookyoohis place with them as a son and a brother.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IVyooyooRaskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Soniayoolived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found theyooporter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts ofyooKapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyardyoothe entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the secondyoofloor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storeyyooover the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain whereyooto turn for Kapernaumov's door, a door opened three paces from him; heyoomechanically took hold of it.yooyoo"Who is there?" a woman's voice asked uneasily.yooyoo"It's I... come to see you," answered Raskolnikov and he walked into theyootiny entry.yooyooOn a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.yooyoo"It's you! Good heavens!" cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted toyoothe spot.yooyoo"Which is your room? This way?" and Raskolnikov, trying not to look atyooher, hastened in.yooyooA minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down theyoocandlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressiblyyooagitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colouryoorushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... Sheyoofelt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quicklyyooand sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.yooyooIt was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by theyooKapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.yooIn the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, alwaysyookept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.yooSonia's room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle andyoothis gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows lookingyooout on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acuteyooangle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.yooThe other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely anyyoofurniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,yoobeside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by ayooblue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the otheryooflat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the oppositeyoowall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawersyoolooking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in theyooroom. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in theyoocorners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. Thereyoowas every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.yooyooSonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively andyoounceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to trembleyoowith terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiteryooof her destinies.yooyoo"I am late.... It's eleven, isn't it?" he asked, still not lifting hisyooeyes.yooyoo"Yes," muttered Sonia, "oh yes, it is," she added, hastily, as though inyoothat lay her means of escape. "My landlady's clock has just struck... Iyooheard it myself...."yooyoo"I've come to you for the last time," Raskolnikov went on gloomily,yooalthough this was the first time. "I may perhaps not see you again..."yooyoo"Are you... going away?"yooyoo"I don't know... to-morrow...."yooyoo"Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?" Sonia's voiceyooshook.yooyoo"I don't know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I'veyoocome to say one word...."yooyooHe raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he wasyoositting down while she was all the while standing before him.yooyoo"Why are you standing? Sit down," he said in a changed voice, gentle andyoofriendly.yooyooShe sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.yooyoo"How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand."yooyooHe took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.yooyoo"I have always been like that," she said.yooyoo"Even when you lived at home?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"Of course, you were," he added abruptly and the expression of his faceyooand the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.yooyooHe looked round him once more.yooyoo"You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?"yooyoo"Yes...."yooyoo"They live there, through that door?"yooyoo"Yes.... They have another room like this."yooyoo"All in one room?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"I should be afraid in your room at night," he observed gloomily.yooyoo"They are very good people, very kind," answered Sonia, who still seemedyoobewildered, "and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.yooAnd they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me."yooyoo"They all stammer, don't they?"yooyoo"Yes.... He stammers and he's lame. And his wife, too.... It's notyooexactly that she stammers, but she can't speak plainly. She is a veryyookind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are sevenyoochildren... and it's only the eldest one that stammers and the othersyooare simply ill... but they don't stammer.... But where did you hearyooabout them?" she added with some surprise.yooyoo"Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how youyoowent out at six o'clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovnayooknelt down by your bed."yooyooSonia was confused.yooyoo"I fancied I saw him to-day," she whispered hesitatingly.yooyoo"Whom?"yooyoo"Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about tenyooo'clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. Iyoowanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna...."yooyoo"You were walking in the streets?"yooyoo"Yes," Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion andyoolooking down.yooyoo"Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?"yooyoo"Oh no, what are you saying? No!" Sonia looked at him almost withyoodismay.yooyoo"You love her, then?"yooyoo"Love her? Of course!" said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and sheyooclasped her hands in distress. "Ah, you don't.... If you only knew!yooYou see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, youyoosee... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... howyookind! Ah, you don't understand, you don't understand!"yooyooSonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitementyooand distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish inyooher eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, thatyooshe was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sortyooof _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected inyooevery feature of her face.yooyoo"Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,yoowhat then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is soyoounhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,yooshe is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousnessyooeverywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, sheyoowouldn't do wrong. She doesn't see that it's impossible for people toyoobe righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She isyoogood!"yooyoo"And what will happen to you?"yooyooSonia looked at him inquiringly.yooyoo"They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your handsyoobefore, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,yoohow will it be now?"yooyoo"I don't know," Sonia articulated mournfully.yooyoo"Will they stay there?"yooyoo"I don't know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,yooI hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and KaterinayooIvanovna says that she won't stay another minute."yooyoo"How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?"yooyoo"Oh, no, don't talk like that.... We are one, we live like one." Soniayoowas agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some otheryoolittle bird were to be angry. "And what could she do? What, what couldyooshe do?" she persisted, getting hot and excited. "And how she criedyooto-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven't you noticed it? At one minute sheyoois worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, theyoolunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,yooweeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against theyoowall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all heryoohopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she willyooborrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me andyooset up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me toyoosuperintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kissesyooand hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith inyooher fancies! One can't contradict her. And all the day long she has beenyoowashing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room withyooher feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went thisyoomorning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs areyooquite worn out. Only the money we'd reckoned wasn't enough, not nearlyyooenough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,yooyou don't know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before theyooshopmen because she hadn't enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her...."yooyoo"Well, after that I can understand your living like this," Raskolnikovyoosaid with a bitter smile.yooyoo"And aren't you sorry for them? Aren't you sorry?" Sonia flew at himyooagain. "Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you'dyooseen nothing of it, and if you'd seen everything, oh dear! And howyoooften, how often I've brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Onlyyooa week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I've done it! Ah,yooI've been wretched at the thought of it all day!"yooyooSonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.yooyoo"You were cruel?"yooyoo"Yes, I--I. I went to see them," she went on, weeping, "and father said,yoo'read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here's a book.' Heyoohad a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he livesyoothere, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, 'Iyoocan't stay,' as I didn't want to read, and I'd gone in chiefly to showyooKaterina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me someyoocollars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. KaterinayooIvanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herselfyooin the glass and was delighted with them. 'Make me a present of them,yooSonia,' she said, 'please do.' '_Please do_,' she said, she wanted themyooso much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her oldyoohappy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and sheyoohas no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn't had all these years!yooAnd she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she'd sooner giveyooaway everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And Iyoowas sorry to give them. 'What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?' Iyoosaid. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gaveyoome such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.yooAnd it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,yoobut for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,yoochange it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it's nothing to you!"yooyoo"Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?"yooyoo"Yes.... Did you know her?" Sonia asked with some surprise.yooyoo"Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soonyoodie," said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.yooyoo"Oh, no, no, no!"yooyooAnd Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploringyoothat she should not.yooyoo"But it will be better if she does die."yooyoo"No, not better, not at all better!" Sonia unconsciously repeated inyoodismay.yooyoo"And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?"yooyoo"Oh, I don't know," cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put heryoohands to her head.yooyooIt was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before andyoohe had only roused it again.yooyoo"And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get illyooand are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?" he persistedyoopitilessly.yooyoo"How can you? That cannot be!"yooyooAnd Sonia's face worked with awful terror.yooyoo"Cannot be?" Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. "You are notyooinsured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They willyoobe in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her headyooagainst some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....yooThen she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to theyoohospital, she will die, and the children..."yooyoo"Oh, no.... God will not let it be!" broke at last from Sonia'syoooverburdened bosom.yooyooShe listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumbyooentreaty, as though it all depended upon him.yooyooRaskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.yooSonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terribleyoodejection.yooyoo"And can't you save? Put by for a rainy day?" he asked, stoppingyoosuddenly before her.yooyoo"No," whispered Sonia.yooyoo"Of course not. Have you tried?" he added almost ironically.yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"And it didn't come off! Of course not! No need to ask."yooyooAnd again he paced the room. Another minute passed.yooyoo"You don't get money every day?"yooyooSonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.yooyoo"No," she whispered with a painful effort.yooyoo"It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt," he said suddenly.yooyoo"No, no! It can't be, no!" Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as thoughyooshe had been stabbed. "God would not allow anything so awful!"yooyoo"He lets others come to it."yooyoo"No, no! God will protect her, God!" she repeated beside herself.yooyoo"But, perhaps, there is no God at all," Raskolnikov answered with a sortyooof malignance, laughed and looked at her.yooyooSonia's face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked atyoohim with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could notyoospeak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.yooyoo"You say Katerina Ivanovna's mind is unhinged; your own mind isyoounhinged," he said after a brief silence.yooyooFive minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, notyoolooking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He putyoohis two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearfulyooface. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips wereyootwitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to theyooground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. Andyoocertainly he looked like a madman.yooyoo"What are you doing to me?" she muttered, turning pale, and a suddenyooanguish clutched at her heart.yooyooHe stood up at once.yooyoo"I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering ofyoohumanity," he said wildly and walked away to the window. "Listen," heyooadded, turning to her a minute later. "I said just now to an insolentyooman that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sisteryoohonour making her sit beside you."yooyoo"Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?" cried Sonia,yoofrightened. "Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I'm... dishonourable....yooAh, why did you say that?"yooyoo"It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,yoobut because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that'syootrue," he added almost solemnly, "and your worst sin is that you haveyoodestroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn't that fearful? Isn'tyooit fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and atyoothe same time you know yourself (you've only to open your eyes) that youyooare not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,"yoohe went on almost in a frenzy, "how this shame and degradation can existyooin you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would beyoobetter, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and endyooit all!"yooyoo"But what would become of them?" Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him withyooeyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.yooyooRaskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so sheyoomust have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestlyyooshe had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, thatyoonow she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticedyoothe cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and hisyoopeculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,yooand that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thoughtyooof her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had longyootortured her. "What, what," he thought, "could hitherto have hinderedyooher from putting an end to it?" Only then he realised what those pooryoolittle orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,yooknocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.yooyooBut, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character andyoothe amount of education she had after all received, she could not in anyyoocase remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could sheyoohave remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,yoosince she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course heyooknew that Sonia's position was an exceptional case, though unhappily notyoounique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, heryootinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,yoohave killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held heryooup--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touchedyooher mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to heryooheart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....yooyoo"There are three ways before her," he thought, "the canal, the madhouse,yooor... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turnsyoothe heart to stone."yooyooThe last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he wasyooyoung, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believingyoothat the last end was the most likely.yooyoo"But can that be true?" he cried to himself. "Can that creature who hasyoostill preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at lastyoointo that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already haveyoobegun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,yoobecause vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannotyoobe!" he cried, as Sonia had just before. "No, what has kept her from theyoocanal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if sheyoohas not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of heryoomind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?yooHow can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which sheyoois slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does sheyooexpect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn't that all mean madness?"yooyooHe stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeedyoobetter than any other. He began looking more intently at her.yooyoo"So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?" he asked her.yooyooSonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.yooyoo"What should I be without God?" she whispered rapidly, forcibly,yooglancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.yooyoo"Ah, so that is it!" he thought.yooyoo"And what does God do for you?" he asked, probing her further.yooyooSonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weakyoochest kept heaving with emotion.yooyoo"Be silent! Don't ask! You don't deserve!" she cried suddenly, lookingyoosternly and wrathfully at him.yooyoo"That's it, that's it," he repeated to himself.yooyoo"He does everything," she whispered quickly, looking down again.yooyoo"That's the way out! That's the explanation," he decided, scrutinisingyooher with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.yooHe gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those softyooblue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, thatyoolittle body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemedyooto him more and more strange, almost impossible. "She is a religiousyoomaniac!" he repeated to himself.yooyooThere was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it everyyootime he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.yooIt was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound inyooleather, old and worn.yooyoo"Where did you get that?" he called to her across the room.yooyooShe was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.yooyoo"It was brought me," she answered, as it were unwillingly, not lookingyooat him.yooyoo"Who brought it?"yooyoo"Lizaveta, I asked her for it."yooyoo"Lizaveta! strange!" he thought.yooyooEverything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful everyyoomoment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over theyoopages.yooyoo"Where is the story of Lazarus?" he asked suddenly.yooyooSonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She wasyoostanding sideways to the table.yooyoo"Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia."yooyooShe stole a glance at him.yooyoo"You are not looking in the right place.... It's in the fourth gospel,"yooshe whispered sternly, without looking at him.yooyoo"Find it and read it to me," he said. He sat down with his elbow on theyootable, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared toyoolisten.yooyoo"In three weeks' time they'll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall beyoothere if I am not in a worse place," he muttered to himself.yooyooSonia heard Raskolnikov's request distrustfully and moved hesitatinglyyooto the table. She took the book however.yooyoo"Haven't you read it?" she asked, looking up at him across the table.yooyooHer voice became sterner and sterner.yooyoo"Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!"yooyoo"And haven't you heard it in church?"yooyoo"I... haven't been. Do you often go?"yooyoo"N-no," whispered Sonia.yooyooRaskolnikov smiled.yooyoo"I understand.... And you won't go to your father's funeral to-morrow?"yooyoo"Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too... I had a requiemyooservice."yooyoo"For whom?"yooyoo"For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe."yooyooHis nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.yooyoo"Were you friends with Lizaveta?"yooyoo"Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... sheyoocouldn't.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God."yooyooThe last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something newyooagain: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religiousyoomaniacs.yooyoo"I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It's infectious!"yooyoo"Read!" he cried irritably and insistently.yooyooSonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to readyooto him. He looked almost with exasperation at the "unhappy lunatic."yooyoo"What for? You don't believe?..." she whispered softly and as it wereyoobreathlessly.yooyoo"Read! I want you to," he persisted. "You used to read to Lizaveta."yooyooSonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, heryoovoice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out theyoofirst syllable.yooyoo"Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany..." she forcedyooherself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like anyoooverstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.yooyooRaskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to himyooand the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted onyooher doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for heryooto betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that theseyoofeelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhapsyoofor years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappyyoofather and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst ofyoostarving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the sameyootime he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her withyoodread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to readyooto _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come ofyooit!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.yooShe mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went onyooreading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenthyooverse:yooyoo"And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerningyootheir brother.yooyoo"Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and metyooHim: but Mary sat still in the house.yooyoo"Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brotheryoohad not died.yooyoo"But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will giveyooit Thee...."yooyooThen she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice wouldyooquiver and break again.yooyoo"Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.yooyoo"Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in theyooresurrection, at the last day.yooyoo"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he thatyoobelieveth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.yooyoo"And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believestyoothou this?yooyoo"She saith unto Him,"yooyoo(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly asyoothough she were making a public confession of faith.)yooyoo"Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Whichyooshould come into the world."yooyooShe stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself wentyooon reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table andyoohis eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.yooyoo"Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down atyooHis feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother hadyoonot died.yooyoo"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping whichyoocame with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,yooyoo"And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come andyoosee.yooyoo"Jesus wept.yooyoo"Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!yooyoo"And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of theyooblind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"yooyooRaskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!yooShe was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She wasyoogetting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immenseyootriumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joyyoogave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what sheyoowas reading by heart. At the last verse "Could not this Man which openedyoothe eyes of the blind..." dropping her voice she passionately reproducedyoothe doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, whoyooin another moment would fall at His feet as though struck byyoothunder, sobbing and believing.... "And _he, he_--too, is blinded andyoounbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! Atyooonce, now," was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happyyooanticipation.yooyoo"Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was ayoocave, and a stone lay upon it.yooyoo"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that wasyoodead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath beenyoodead four days."yooyooShe laid emphasis on the word _four_.yooyoo"Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldestyoobelieve, thou shouldest see the glory of God?yooyoo"Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.yooAnd Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thouyoohast heard Me.yooyoo"And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people whichyoostand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.yooyoo"And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, comeyooforth.yooyoo"And he that was dead came forth."yooyoo(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she wereyooseeing it before her eyes.)yooyoo"Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound aboutyoowith a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go.yooyoo"Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things whichyooJesus did believed on Him."yooyooShe could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chairyooquickly.yooyoo"That is all about the raising of Lazarus," she whispered severely andyooabruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raiseyooher eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end wasyooflickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in theyoopoverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangelyyoobeen reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.yooyoo"I came to speak of something," Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He gotyooup and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His faceyoowas particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination inyooit.yooyoo"I have abandoned my family to-day," he said, "my mother and sister. Iyooam not going to see them. I've broken with them completely."yooyoo"What for?" asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother andyoosister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. Sheyooheard his news almost with horror.yooyoo"I have only you now," he added. "Let us go together.... I've come toyooyou, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!"yooyooHis eyes glittered "as though he were mad," Sonia thought, in her turn.yooyoo"Go where?" she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.yooyoo"How do I know? I only know it's the same road, I know that and nothingyoomore. It's the same goal!"yooyooShe looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he wasyooterribly, infinitely unhappy.yooyoo"No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I haveyoounderstood. I need you, that is why I have come to you."yooyoo"I don't understand," whispered Sonia.yooyoo"You'll understand later. Haven't you done the same? You, too, haveyootransgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laidyoohands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (it's all theyoosame!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you'llyooend in the Hay Market.... But you won't be able to stand it, and ifyooyou remain alone you'll go out of your mind like me. You are like a madyoocreature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!"yooyoo"What for? What's all this for?" said Sonia, strangely and violentlyyooagitated by his words.yooyoo"What for? Because you can't remain like this, that's why! You must lookyoothings straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cryyoothat God won't allow it. What will happen, if you should really be takenyooto the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, she'll soonyoodie and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won't come toyoogrief? Haven't you seen children here at the street corners sent outyooby their mothers to beg? I've found out where those mothers live and inyoowhat surroundings. Children can't remain children there! At seven theyoochild is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image ofyooChrist: 'theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.' He bade us honour and loveyoothem, they are the humanity of the future...."yooyoo"What's to be done, what's to be done?" repeated Sonia, weepingyoohysterically and wringing her hands.yooyoo"What's to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that's all,yooand take the suffering on oneself. What, you don't understand? You'llyoounderstand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over allyootrembling creation and all the ant-heap!... That's the goal, rememberyoothat! That's my farewell message. Perhaps it's the last time I shallyoospeak to you. If I don't come to-morrow, you'll hear of it all, and thenyooremember these words. And some day later on, in years to come, you'llyoounderstand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I'll tell youyoowho killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye."yooyooSonia started with terror.yooyoo"Why, do you know who killed her?" she asked, chilled with horror,yoolooking wildly at him.yooyoo"I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I'm notyoocoming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose youyooout long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and whenyooLizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, don't shake hands.yooTo-morrow!"yooyooHe went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was likeyooone insane and felt it. Her head was going round.yooyoo"Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did thoseyoowords mean? It's awful!" But at the same time _the idea_ did not enteryooher head, not for a moment! "Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He hasyooabandoned his mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? Andyoowhat had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her footyooand said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not liveyoowithout her.... Oh, merciful heavens!"yooyooSonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up fromyootime to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverishyoosleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of readingyoothe gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissingyooher feet, weeping.yooyooOn the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia's roomyoofrom Madame Resslich's flat, was a room which had long stood empty. Ayoocard was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over theyoocanal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to theyooroom's being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had beenyoostanding, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov wentyooout he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own roomyoowhich adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried ityooto the door that led to Sonia's room. The conversation had struck himyooas interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much soyoothat he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, foryooinstance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, butyoomight listen in comfort.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VyooyooWhen next morning at eleven o'clock punctually Raskolnikov went into theyoodepartment of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name inyooto Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:yooit was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expectedyoothat they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, andyoopeople, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continuallyyoopassing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like anyoooffice, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they hadyoono notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily andyoosuspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, someyoomysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there wasyoonothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in pettyyoodetails, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.yooHe might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in himyoothat if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of theyooearth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and waityoolike that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear atyooeleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simplyyoohe knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)yooand so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantomyooexaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjectureyoohad begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all hisyooalarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a freshyooconflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt ayoorush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear atyoofacing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all wasyoomeeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatredyooand was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was suchyoothat he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold andyooarrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,yooto watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrainedyoonerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.yooyooHe found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a roomyooneither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, thatyoostood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, ayoobookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,yooof polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,yoobeyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov's entranceyooPorfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come inyooand they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genialyooand good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes thatyooRaskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he hadyoobeen thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.yooyoo"Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain"... began Porfiry,yooholding out both hands to him. "Come, sit down, old man... or perhapsyooyou don't like to be called 'my dear fellow' and 'old man!'--_toutyoocourt_? Please don't think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa."yooyooRaskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. "In our domain,"yoothe apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were allyoocharacteristic signs.yooyoo"He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew ityooback in time," struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,yoobut when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.yooyoo"I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it allyooright or shall I copy it again?"yooyoo"What? A paper? Yes, yes, don't be uneasy, it's all right," PorfiryyooPetrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took theyoopaper and looked at it. "Yes, it's all right. Nothing more is needed,"yoohe declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.yooyooA minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from theyootable and put it on his bureau.yooyoo"I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...yooformally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?" Raskolnikovyoowas beginning again. "Why did I put in 'I believe'" passed throughyoohis mind in a flash. "Why am I so uneasy at having put in that '_Iyoobelieve_'?" came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that hisyoouneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at theyoofirst looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and thatyoothis was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion wasyooincreasing. "It's bad, it's bad! I shall say too much again."yooyoo"Yes, yes, yes! There's no hurry, there's no hurry," muttered PorfiryyooPetrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,yooas it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,yooat one moment avoiding Raskolnikov's suspicious glance, then againyoostanding still and looking him straight in the face.yooyooHis fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rollingyoofrom one side to the other and rebounding back.yooyoo"We've plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, ayoocigarette!" he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. "You know I amyooreceiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, myyoogovernment quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had toyoohave some repairs done here. It's almost finished now.... Governmentyooquarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?"yooyoo"Yes, a capital thing," answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almostyooironically.yooyoo"A capital thing, a capital thing," repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, asyoothough he had just thought of something quite different. "Yes, a capitalyoothing," he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov andyoostopping short two steps from him.yooyooThis stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with theyooserious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.yooyooBut this stirred Raskolnikov's spleen more than ever and he could notyooresist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.yooyoo"Tell me, please," he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at himyooand taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. "I believe it's ayoosort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigatingyoolawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at leastyooan irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the manyoothey are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once toyoogive him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn'tyoothat so? It's a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manualsyooof the art?"yooyoo"Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about governmentyooquarters... eh?"yooyooAnd as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;yooa good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on hisyooforehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadenedyooand he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking allyooover and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forcedyoohimself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,yoobroke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov'syoorepulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled andyoostared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while hisyoointentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution onyooboth sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing inyoohis visitor's face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance withyoowhich the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significantyooin Raskolnikov's eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not beenyooembarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhapsyoofallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive hereyoounknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and inyooanother moment would break upon him...yooyooHe went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took hisyoocap.yooyoo"Porfiry Petrovitch," he began resolutely, though with considerableyooirritation, "yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to youyoofor some inquiries" (he laid special stress on the word "inquiries"). "Iyoohave come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allowyoome to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeralyooof that man who was run over, of whom you... know also," he added,yoofeeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated atyoohis anger. "I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It'syoopartly what made me ill. In short," he shouted, feeling that the phraseyooabout his illness was still more out of place, "in short, kindly examineyoome or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in theyooproper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,yoogood-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now."yooyoo"Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?"yoocackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving offyoolaughing. "Please don't disturb yourself," he began fidgeting from placeyooto place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. "There's no hurry,yoothere's no hurry, it's all nonsense. Oh, no, I'm very glad you've comeyooto see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as foryoomy confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. RodionyooRomanovitch? That is your name?... It's my nerves, you tickled meyooso with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake withyoolaughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I'myoooften afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or Iyooshall think you are angry..."yooyooRaskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowningyooangrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.yooyoo"I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,"yooPorfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoidingyoohis visitor's eyes. "You see, I'm a bachelor, a man of no consequenceyooand not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I'm set, I'myoorunning to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that inyooour Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, butyoorespect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour beforeyoothey can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sityooopposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects ofyooconversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always haveyootheir subjects of conversation, _c'est de rigueur_, but people of theyoomiddle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tiedyooand awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of publicyoointerest, or whether it is we are so honest we don't want to deceive oneyooanother, I don't know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, ityoolooks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am soyoodelighted..."yooyooRaskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence withyooa serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of PorfiryyooPetrovitch. "Does he really want to distract my attention with his sillyyoobabble?"yooyoo"I can't offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with ayoofriend?" Porfiry pattered on, "and you know all these officialyooduties... please don't mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dearyoofellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise isyooabsolutely indispensable for me. I'm always sitting and so glad to beyoomoving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... Iyooalways intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,yooeven Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you haveyooit, modern science... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here, inquiriesyooand all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...yooI assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing foryoothe interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observationyooyourself just now very aptly and wittily." (Raskolnikov had made noyooobservation of the kind.) "One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! Oneyookeeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform andyoowe shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as foryooour legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agreeyoowith you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows thatyoothey begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happilyyooput it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitousyoocomparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by 'governmentyooquarters'... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I won't go on! Ah,yooby the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality justyoonow, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what's the use of formality?yooIn many cases it's nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and getsyooa good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allowyoome to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examiningyoolawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work ofyooinvestigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!"yooyooPorfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled onyoouttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and againyooreverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room, movingyoohis fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with hisyooright hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulationsyoothat were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikovyoosuddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stopyoofor a moment near the door, as though he were listening.yooyoo"Is he expecting anything?"yooyoo"You are certainly quite right about it," Porfiry began gaily, lookingyoowith extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him andyooinstantly put him on his guard); "certainly quite right in laughing soyoowittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychologicalyoomethods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheresyootoo closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, ifyooI recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other toyoobe a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you're reading for the law,yooof course, Rodion Romanovitch?"yooyoo"Yes, I was..."yooyoo"Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don'tyoosuppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publishyooabout crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if Iyootook this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry himyooprematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I mayyoobe bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be inyooquite a different position, you know, so why shouldn't I let him walkyooabout the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don't quite understand, soyooI'll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, Iyoomay very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! You'reyoolaughing?"yooyooRaskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressedyoolips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch's.yooyoo"Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are soyoodifferent. You say 'evidence'. Well, there may be evidence. Butyooevidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examiningyoolawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, soyooto say, mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidenceyoosuch as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!yooAnd if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_yoowas the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means ofyoogetting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so toyoospeak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set hisyoomind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that atyooSevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible frightyoothat the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But whenyoothey saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,yooI am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months atyooleast. You're laughing, you don't believe me again? Of course, you'reyooright, too. You're right, you're right. These are special cases, Iyooadmit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, theyoogeneral case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,yoofor which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist atyooall, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soonyooas it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case andyoosometimes a case unlike any that's gone before. Very comic cases of thatyoosort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I don't touchyoohim and don't worry him, but let him know or at least suspect everyyoomoment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, andyooif he is in continual suspicion and terror, he'll be bound to lose hisyoohead. He'll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it asyooplain as twice two are four--it's delightful. It may be so with a simpleyoopeasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on ayoocertain side, it's a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it's a veryyooimportant matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And thenyoothere are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, theyyooare all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all sufferyoofrom spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it'syoono anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walkyooabout for a bit! I know well enough that I've caught him and that heyoowon't escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? AyooPole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watchingyooand have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the countryyooperhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.yooA modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with suchyoostrangers as our peasants. He-he! But that's all nonsense, and onyoothe surface. It's not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he isyoo_psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression!yooThrough a law of nature he can't escape me if he had anywhere to go.yooHave you seen a butterfly round a candle? That's how he will keepyoocircling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He'llyoobegin to brood, he'll weave a tangle round himself, he'll worry himselfyooto death! What's more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if Iyooonly give him long enough interval.... And he'll keep circling roundyoome, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! He'll fly straight into myyoomouth and I'll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! Youyoodon't believe me?"yooyooRaskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing withyoothe same intensity into Porfiry's face.yooyoo"It's a lesson," he thought, turning cold. "This is beyond the catyooplaying with a mouse, like yesterday. He can't be showing off his poweryoowith no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he mustyoohave another object. What is it? It's all nonsense, my friend, you areyoopretending, to scare me! You've no proofs and the man I saw had noyooreal existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me upyoobeforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you won't do it! Butyoowhy give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, myyoofriend, you are wrong, you won't do it even though you have some trapyoofor me... let us see what you have in store for me."yooyooAnd he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At timesyoohe longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what heyoodreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were fleckedyoowith foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not toyoospeak till the right moment. He realised that this was the bestyoopolicy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would beyooirritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking tooyoofreely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for.yooyoo"No, I see you don't believe me, you think I am playing a harmless jokeyooon you," Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chucklingyooat every instant and again pacing round the room. "And to be sure you'reyooright: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas inyooother people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuseyooan old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so toyoosay, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, likeyooall young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you andyoothat's for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, asyoofar as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they'd beatenyooNapoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked ityooall out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrenderedyoowith all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you areyoolaughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!yooBut I can't help it, it's my weakness. I am fond of military science.yooAnd I'm ever so fond of reading all military histories. I've certainlyyoomissed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon myyooword I ought. I shouldn't have been a Napoleon, but I might have been ayoomajor, he-he! Well, I'll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, aboutyoothis _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man's temperament, myyoodear sir, are weighty matters and it's astonishing how they sometimesyoodeceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speakingyooseriously, Rodion Romanovitch" (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, whoyoowas scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; evenyoohis voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) "Moreover, I'myooa candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy Iyooreally am: I tell you these things for nothing and don't even expect ayooreward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendidyoothing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation ofyoolife, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for ayoopoor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he's liableyooto be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man afteryooall! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal's temperament, worseyooluck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don't thinkyooof that 'when they overstep all obstacles,' as you wittily and cleverlyyooexpressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _specialyoocase_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;yooyou might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but atyoothe most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of courseyoothere may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he'syoogiven us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn't reckon on hisyootemperament. That's what betrays him! Another time he will be carriedyooaway by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, heyoowill turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness willyoobe _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given usyooan idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will thinkyoodifferently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is likeyoothat at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,yoospeaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts ofyooallegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn't you take me longyooago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,yoothe psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everythingyoolike a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you soyoopale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?"yooyoo"Oh, don't trouble, please," cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly brokeyoointo a laugh. "Please don't trouble."yooyooPorfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.yooRaskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hystericalyoolaughter.yooyoo"Porfiry Petrovitch," he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, thoughyoohis legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. "I see clearly at lastyoothat you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sisteryooLizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If youyoofind that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, thenyooprosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to myyooface and worried..."yooyooHis lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrainyoohis voice.yooyoo"I won't allow it!" he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. "Doyooyou hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won't allow it."yooyoo"Good heavens! What does it mean?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparentlyyooquite frightened. "Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is theyoomatter with you?"yooyoo"I won't allow it," Raskolnikov shouted again.yooyoo"Hush, my dear man! They'll hear and come in. Just think, what could weyoosay to them?" Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his faceyooclose to Raskolnikov's.yooyoo"I won't allow it, I won't allow it," Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,yoobut he too spoke in a sudden whisper.yooyooPorfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.yooyoo"Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You'reyooill!" and he was running to the door to call for some when he found ayoodecanter of water in the corner. "Come, drink a little," he whispered,yoorushing up to him with the decanter. "It will be sure to do you good."yooyooPorfiry Petrovitch's alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikovyoowas silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not takeyoothe water, however.yooyoo"Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you'll drive yourself out of youryoomind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some water, do drink a little."yooyooHe forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically toyoohis lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.yooyoo"Yes, you've had a little attack! You'll bring back your illness again,yoomy dear fellow," Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,yoothough he still looked rather disconcerted. "Good heavens, you mustyootake more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see meyooyesterday--I know, I know, I've a nasty, ironical temper, but what theyyoomade of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you'd been. Weyoodined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my handsyooin despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy's sake, sityoodown!"yooyoo"No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,"yooRaskolnikov answered sharply.yooyoo"You knew?"yooyoo"I knew. What of it?"yooyoo"Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;yooI know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at nightyoowhen it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, soyoothat the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, Iyoounderstand your state of mind at that time... but you'll drive yourselfyoomad like that, upon my word! You'll lose your head! You're full ofyoogenerous indignation at the wrongs you've received, first from destiny,yooand then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing toyooanother to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, becauseyooyou are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That's so, isn'tyooit? I have guessed how you feel, haven't I? Only in that way you'llyoolose your head and Razumihin's, too; he's too _good_ a man for suchyooa position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and youryooillness is infectious for him... I'll tell you about it when you areyoomore yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness' sake. Please rest, youyoolook shocking, do sit down."yooyooRaskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. Inyooamazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch whoyoostill seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.yooBut he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strangeyooinclination to believe. Porfiry's unexpected words about the flat hadyooutterly overwhelmed him. "How can it be, he knows about the flat then,"yoohe thought suddenly, "and he tells it me himself!"yooyoo"Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, ayoocase of morbid psychology," Porfiry went on quickly. "A man confessed toyoomurder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he broughtyooforward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, butyooonly partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew thatyoohe had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, ityoogot on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and heyoopersuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Courtyooof Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put underyooproper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dearyoofellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulseyooto work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking aboutyooblood! I've studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A manyoois sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just theyoosame with bell-ringing.... It's all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! Youyoohave begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experiencedyoodoctor, what's the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! Youyoowere delirious when you did all this!"yooyooFor a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.yooyoo"Is it possible, is it possible," flashed through his mind, "that he isyoostill lying? He can't be, he can't be." He rejected that idea, feelingyooto what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that furyyoomight drive him mad.yooyoo"I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing," he cried, strainingyooevery faculty to penetrate Porfiry's game, "I was quite myself, do youyoohear?"yooyoo"Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,yooyou were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tellyoome! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you wereyooactually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,yoowould you insist that you were not delirious but in full possessionyooof your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it beyoopossible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything onyooyour conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.yooThat's so, isn't it?"yooyooThere was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back onyoothe sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity atyoohim.yooyoo"Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that heyoocame of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don'tyooconceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation."yooyooRaskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.yooyoo"You keep telling lies," he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lipsyoointo a sickly smile, "you are trying again to show that you know allyoomy game, that you know all I shall say beforehand," he said, consciousyoohimself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. "You want toyoofrighten me... or you are simply laughing at me..."yooyooHe still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light ofyoointense hatred in his eyes.yooyoo"You keep lying," he said. "You know perfectly well that the bestyoopolicy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... toyooconceal as little as possible. I don't believe you!"yooyoo"What a wily person you are!" Porfiry tittered, "there's no catchingyooyou; you've a perfect monomania. So you don't believe me? But still youyoodo believe me, you believe a quarter; I'll soon make you believe theyoowhole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish youyoogood."yooyooRaskolnikov's lips trembled.yooyoo"Yes, I do," went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov's arm genially, "youyoomust take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are hereyoonow; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you doyoonothing but frighten them..."yooyoo"What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it ofyooyours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?"yooyoo"Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don'tyoonotice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. FromyooRazumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,yooyou interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, youryoosuspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To returnyooto bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed ayooprecious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),yooand you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,yooshould I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed youryoosuspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have divertedyooyour attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (youryooexpression) saying: 'And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten oryoonearly eleven at the murdered woman's flat and why did you ring the bellyooand why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the portersyooto go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?' That's howyooI ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought toyoohave taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhapsyoohave arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I haveyoonot done that! But you can't look at it normally and you see nothing, Iyoosay again."yooyooRaskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail toyooperceive it.yooyoo"You are lying all the while," he cried, "I don't know your object,yoobut you are lying. You did not speak like that just now and I cannot beyoomistaken!"yooyoo"I am lying?" Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preservingyooa good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the leastyooconcerned at Raskolnikov's opinion of him. "I am lying... but how didyooI treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Prompting you and givingyooyou every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,yoomelancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!yooThough, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not veryyooreliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don't remember--that'syooall right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your deliriumyoowere you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? Thereyoomay have been others, eh? He-he-he!"yooyooRaskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.yooyoo"Briefly," he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in soyoodoing pushing Porfiry back a little, "briefly, I want to know, do youyooacknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, PorfiryyooPetrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!"yooyoo"What a business I'm having with you!" cried Porfiry with a perfectlyyoogood-humoured, sly and composed face. "And why do you want to know, whyyoodo you want to know so much, since they haven't begun to worry you? Why,yooyou are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Whyyoodo you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!"yooyoo"I repeat," Raskolnikov cried furiously, "that I can't put up with it!"yooyoo"With what? Uncertainty?" interrupted Porfiry.yooyoo"Don't jeer at me! I won't have it! I tell you I won't have it. I can'tyooand I won't, do you hear, do you hear?" he shouted, bringing his fistyoodown on the table again.yooyoo"Hush! Hush! They'll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care ofyooyourself. I am not joking," Porfiry whispered, but this time there wasyoonot the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Nowyoohe was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside allyoomystification.yooyooBut this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fellyoointo actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command toyoospeak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.yooyoo"I will not allow myself to be tortured," he whispered, instantlyyoorecognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command andyoodriven to even greater fury by the thought. "Arrest me, search me, butyookindly act in due form and don't play with me! Don't dare!"yooyoo"Don't worry about the form," Porfiry interrupted with the same slyyoosmile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. "I invitedyooyou to see me quite in a friendly way."yooyoo"I don't want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here,yooI take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?"yooyooHe took up his cap and went to the door.yooyoo"And won't you see my little surprise?" chuckled Porfiry, again takingyoohim by the arm and stopping him at the door.yooyooHe seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddenedyooRaskolnikov.yooyoo"What surprise?" he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry inyooalarm.yooyoo"My little surprise, it's sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!"yoo(He pointed to the locked door.) "I locked him in that he should notyooescape."yooyoo"What is it? Where? What?..."yooyooRaskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it wasyoolocked.yooyoo"It's locked, here is the key!"yooyooAnd he brought a key out of his pocket.yooyoo"You are lying," roared Raskolnikov without restraint, "you lie, youyoodamned punchinello!" and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the otheryoodoor, not at all alarmed.yooyoo"I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betrayyoomyself to you..."yooyoo"Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear RodionyooRomanovitch. You are in a passion. Don't shout, I shall call theyooclerks."yooyoo"You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to workyoome into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produceyooyour facts! I understand it all. You've no evidence, you have onlyyoowretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov's! You knew my character, youyoowanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests andyoodeputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?yooWhere are they? Produce them?"yooyoo"Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to doyooso would not be acting in form as you say, you don't know the business,yoomy dear fellow.... And there's no escaping form, as you see," Porfiryyoomuttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.yooyoo"Ah, they're coming," cried Raskolnikov. "You've sent for them! Youyooexpected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,yoowhat you like!... I am ready!"yooyooBut at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpectedyoothat neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked foryoosuch a conclusion to their interview.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIyooyooWhen he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.yooyooThe noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened ayoolittle.yooyoo"What is it?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. "Why, I gave orders..."yooyooFor an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there wereyooseveral persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushingyoosomebody back.yooyoo"What is it?" Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.yooyoo"The prisoner Nikolay has been brought," someone answered.yooyoo"He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What's he doing here?yooHow irregular!" cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.yooyoo"But he..." began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.yooyooTwo seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gaveyooa violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.yooyooThis man's appearance was at first sight very strange. He staredyoostraight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determinedyoogleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in hisyooface, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips wereyoofaintly twitching.yooyooHe was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,yooslim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whomyoohe had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizingyoohim by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.yooyooSeveral persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of themyootried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.yooyoo"Go away, it's too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have youyoobrought him so soon?" Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,yooand as it were thrown out of his reckoning.yooyooBut Nikolay suddenly knelt down.yooyoo"What's the matter?" cried Porfiry, surprised.yooyoo"I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer," Nikolay articulatedyoosuddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.yooyooFor ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;yooeven the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, andyoostood immovable.yooyoo"What is it?" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentaryyoostupefaction.yooyoo"I... am the murderer," repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.yooyoo"What... you... what... whom did you kill?" Porfiry Petrovitch wasyooobviously bewildered.yooyooNikolay again was silent for a moment.yooyoo"Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... withyooan axe. Darkness came over me," he added suddenly, and was again silent.yooyooHe still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for someyoomoments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved backyoothe uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.yooThen he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,yoostaring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,yoolooked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, andyooseeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.yooyoo"You're in too great a hurry," he shouted at him, almost angrily. "Iyoodidn't ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?"yooyoo"I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence," Nikolay pronounced.yooyoo"Ach! What did you kill them with?"yooyoo"An axe. I had it ready."yooyoo"Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?"yooyooNikolay did not understand the question.yooyoo"Did you do it alone?"yooyoo"Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it."yooyoo"Don't be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairsyoolike that at the time? The porters met you both!"yooyoo"It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka," Nikolay repliedyoohurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.yooyoo"I knew it!" cried Porfiry, with vexation. "It's not his own tale he isyootelling," he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes restedyooon Raskolnikov again.yooyooHe was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he hadyooforgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.yooyoo"My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!" he flew up to him, "this won'tyoodo; I'm afraid you must go... it's no good your staying... I will...yooyou see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!"yooyooAnd taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.yooyoo"I suppose you didn't expect it?" said Raskolnikov who, though he hadyoonot yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.yooyoo"You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand isyootrembling! He-he!"yooyoo"You're trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!"yooyoo"Yes, I am; I didn't expect it."yooyooThey were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov toyoobe gone.yooyoo"And your little surprise, aren't you going to show it to me?"yooRaskolnikov said, sarcastically.yooyoo"Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironicalyooperson! Come, till we meet!"yooyoo"I believe we can say _good-bye_!"yooyoo"That's in God's hands," muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.yooyooAs he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many peopleyoowere looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,yoowhom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood thereyoowaiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice ofyooPorfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter runningyooafter him, out of breath.yooyoo"One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it's in God's hands,yoobut as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to askyooyou... so we shall meet again, shan't we?"yooyooAnd Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.yooyoo"Shan't we?" he added again.yooyooHe seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.yooyoo"You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... Iyoolost my temper," began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courageyoothat he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.yooyoo"Don't mention it, don't mention it," Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.yoo"I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meetyooagain. If it's God's will, we may see a great deal of one another."yooyoo"And will get to know each other through and through?" addedyooRaskolnikov.yooyoo"Yes; know each other through and through," assented Porfiry Petrovitch,yooand he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. "Nowyooyou're going to a birthday party?"yooyoo"To a funeral."yooyoo"Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well."yooyoo"I don't know what to wish you," said Raskolnikov, who had begun toyoodescend the stairs, but looked back again. "I should like to wish youyoosuccess, but your office is such a comical one."yooyoo"Why comical?" Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed toyooprick up his ears at this.yooyoo"Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolayyoopsychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must haveyoobeen at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, andyoonow that he has confessed, you'll begin vivisecting him again. 'You areyoolying,' you'll say. 'You are not the murderer! You can't be! It's notyooyour own tale you are telling!' You must admit it's a comical business!"yooyoo"He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it wasyoonot his own tale he was telling?"yooyoo"How could I help noticing it!"yooyoo"He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You've really ayooplayful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They sayyoothat was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers."yooyoo"Yes, of Gogol."yooyoo"Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you."yooyoo"So shall I."yooyooRaskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered thatyooon getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying toyoocollect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; heyoowas stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,yooamazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay's confessionyoowas an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him atyooonce, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then theyyoowould be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must doyoosomething for himself, for the danger was imminent.yooyooBut how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.yooRemembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene withyooPorfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,yoohe did not yet know all Porfiry's aims, he could not see into all hisyoocalculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knewyoobetter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry's "lead" had been foryoohim. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,yoocircumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the firstyooglance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, wasyoobound to win. There's no denying that Raskolnikov had compromisedyoohimself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there wasyoonothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn'tyoohe mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really someyoosurprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expectingyoosomething or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for theyoounexpected appearance of Nikolay?yooyooPorfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had riskedyoosomething in showing them--and if he had really had anything up hisyoosleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What wasyoothat "surprise"? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it haveyooconcealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? Hisyooyesterday's visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? IfyooPorfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....yooyooHe sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden inyoohis hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took hisyoocap, thought a minute, and went to the door.yooyooHe had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he mightyooconsider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; heyoowanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna's. He would be too late foryoothe funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,yooand there at once he would see Sonia.yooyooHe stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for ayoomoment on to his lips.yooyoo"To-day! To-day," he repeated to himself. "Yes, to-day! So it mustyoobe...."yooyooBut as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. Heyoostarted and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and thereyoosuddenly appeared a figure--yesterday's visitor _from underground_.yooyooThe man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,yooand took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same asyooyesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great changeyooin his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only putyoohis hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would haveyoolooked exactly like a peasant woman.yooyoo"What do you want?" asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man wasyoostill silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touchingyooit with his finger.yooyoo"What is it?" cried Raskolnikov.yooyoo"I have sinned," the man articulated softly.yooyoo"How?"yooyoo"By evil thoughts."yooyooThey looked at one another.yooyoo"I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters goyooto the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that theyyoolet you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost myyoosleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked foryooyou...."yooyoo"Who came?" Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.yooyoo"I did, I've wronged you."yooyoo"Then you come from that house?"yooyoo"I was standing at the gate with them... don't you remember? We haveyoocarried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepareyoohides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed...."yooyooAnd the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway cameyooclearly before Raskolnikov's mind; he recollected that there hadyoobeen several people there besides the porters, women among them.yooHe remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to theyoopolice-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and evenyoonow he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned roundyooand made him some answer....yooyooSo this was the solution of yesterday's horror. The most awful thoughtyoowas that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himselfyooon account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tellyoonothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. SoyooPorfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but thisyoo_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no moreyoofacts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... thenyoowhat can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrestyoohim? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had notyooknown about it before.yooyoo"Was it you who told Porfiry... that I'd been there?" he cried, struckyooby a sudden idea.yooyoo"What Porfiry?"yooyoo"The head of the detective department?"yooyoo"Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went."yooyoo"To-day?"yooyoo"I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how heyooworried you."yooyoo"Where? What? When?"yooyoo"Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time."yooyoo"What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon myyooword!"yooyoo"I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said," began the man;yoo"for it's too late, said they, and maybe he'll be angry that we did notyoocome at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began makingyooinquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. Theyoofirst time I went he wasn't there, when I came an hour later he couldn'tyoosee me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him ofyooeverything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the roomyooand punching himself on the chest. 'What do you scoundrels mean by it?yooIf I'd known about it I should have arrested him!' Then he ran out,yoocalled somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turnedyooto me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and Iyootold him everything, and I told him that you didn't dare to say a wordyooin answer to me yesterday and that you didn't recognise me. And heyoofell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, andyoogetting angry and running about, and when you were announced he toldyoome to go into the next room. 'Sit there a bit,' he said. 'Don't move,yoowhatever you may hear.' And he set a chair there for me and lockedyoome in. 'Perhaps,' he said, 'I may call you.' And when Nikolay'd beenyoobrought he let me out as soon as you were gone. 'I shall send for youyooagain and question you,' he said."yooyoo"And did he question Nikolay while you were there?"yooyoo"He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay."yooyooThe man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the groundyoowith his finger.yooyoo"Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander."yooyoo"May God forgive you," answered Raskolnikov.yooyooAnd as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,yooturned slowly and went out of the room.yooyoo"It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways," repeatedyooRaskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.yooyoo"Now we'll make a fight for it," he said, with a malicious smile, as heyoowent down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame andyoocontempt he recollected his "cowardice."yooyooyooyooyooPART VyooyooyooyooCHAPTER IyooyooThe morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia andyooher mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.yooIntensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to acceptyooas a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day beforeyoofantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had beenyoognawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitchyooimmediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he hadyoojaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking atyoohis noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish ofyoolate, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in theyooconviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a betteryooone. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turnedyooaside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in AndreyyooSemyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.yooThat smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against hisyooyoung friend's account. He had set down a good many points against himyooof late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not toyoohave told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday's interview.yooThat was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsivenessyooand irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantnessyoofollowed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal caseyooin the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flatyoowhich had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was beingyooredecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,yoowould not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had justyoobeen signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though PyotryooPetrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. Inyoothe same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of theyooinstalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to theyooflat.yooyoo"Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?" PyotryooPetrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had ayoogleam of desperate hope. "Can all that be really so irrevocably over?yooIs it no use to make another effort?" The thought of Dounia sent ayoovoluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,yooand if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,yooPyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.yooyoo"It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money," he thought, asyoohe returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov's room, "and why on earth was Iyoosuch a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a pennyyooso that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!yoofoo! If I'd spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseauyooand presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, andyooall that sort of trash from Knopp's and the English shop, my positionyoowould have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused meyooso easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to returnyoomoney and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard toyoodo it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a manyoowho has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H'm! I've made ayooblunder."yooyooAnd grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself ayoofool--but not aloud, of course.yooyooHe returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. Theyoopreparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna's excitedyoohis curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; heyoofancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own caresyoohe had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busyyoolaying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, heyooheard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all theyoolodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the deadyooman, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite ofyoohis previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,yoowas not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the mostyooimportant of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited withyoogreat ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she wasyoovery busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;yooshe was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and sheyoowas proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and heyoowent into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov's, somewhat thoughtful. Heyoohad learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.yooyooAndrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude ofyooPyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.yooPyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stayyoowith him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. Heyoohad not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply fromyooparsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heardyooof Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading youngyooprogressive who was taking an important part in certain interestingyoocircles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It hadyooimpressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles whoyoodespised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him ayoopeculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to formyooeven an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, hadyooheard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of someyoosort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated andyoodistorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What foryoomany years past he had feared more than anything was _being shownyooup_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at theyoothought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid ofyoothis as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,yoowhen he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two casesyooin which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,yoohad been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandalyoofor the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in seriousyootrouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into theyoosubject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, toyooanticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of "our youngeryoogeneration." He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and beforeyoohis visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some currentyoophrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplaceyoosimpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if heyoohad been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, ityoowould not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, theyoosystems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest foryoohim. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once whatyoowas happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anythingyooto fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And whatyooprecisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make upyooto them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this theyoothing to do or not? Couldn't he gain something through them? In factyoohundreds of questions presented themselves.yooyooAndrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangelyyooflaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerkyooand had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was ratheryoosoft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited inyoospeech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.yooHe was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he didyoonot get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitchyooreally was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progressyooand "our younger generation" from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerousyooand varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,yoohalf-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most inyoofashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,yoohowever sincerely.yooyooThough Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning toyoodislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.yooHowever simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that PyotryooPetrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that "he wasyoonot the right sort of man." He had tried expounding to him the system ofyooFourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began toyoolisten too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begunyooinstinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplaceyoosimpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections ofyooany consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things upyoothird-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his ownyoowork of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person heyoowould be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that PyotryooPetrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangestyoopraise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,yoowhen Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute toyoothe establishment of the new "commune," or to abstain from christeningyoohis future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover ayoomonth after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearingyoohis own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they wereyooattributed to him.yooyooPyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise someyoofive-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted overyoobundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any moneyyoowalked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bankyoonotes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convincedyooPyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the moneyyoounmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that PyotryooPetrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him andyoowas, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend byyooreminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.yooyooHe found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, AndreyyooSemyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundationyooof a new special "commune." The brief remarks that dropped from PyotryooPetrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frameyoobetrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the "humane" AndreyyooSemyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch's ill-humour to his recent breachyoowith Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on thatyootheme. He had something progressive to say on the subject whichyoomight console his worthy friend and "could not fail" to promote hisyoodevelopment.yooyoo"There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at theyoowidow's, isn't there?" Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interruptingyooAndrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.yooyoo"Why, don't you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I thinkyooabout all such ceremonies. And she invited you too, I heard. You wereyootalking to her yesterday..."yooyoo"I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent onyoothis feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov. Iyoowas surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, theyoowines! Several people are invited. It's beyond everything!" continuedyooPyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing theyooconversation. "What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I don'tyooremember. But I shan't go. Why should I? I only said a word to her inyoopassing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year's salary asyooa destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me onyoothat account, hasn't she? He-he-he!"yooyoo"I don't intend to go either," said Lebeziatnikov.yooyoo"I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You might wellyoohesitate, he-he!"yooyoo"Who thrashed? Whom?" cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.yooyoo"Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard soyooyesterday... so that's what your convictions amount to... and the womanyooquestion, too, wasn't quite sound, he-he-he!" and Pyotr Petrovitch, asyoothough comforted, went back to clicking his beads.yooyoo"It's all slander and nonsense!" cried Lebeziatnikov, who was alwaysyooafraid of allusions to the subject. "It was not like that at all, ityoowas quite different. You've heard it wrong; it's a libel. I was simplyyoodefending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulledyooout all my whiskers.... It's permissable for anyone, I should hope,yooto defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me onyooprinciple, for it's an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simplyyoopushed her back."yooyoo"He-he-he!" Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.yooyoo"You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... Butyoothat's nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with theyoowoman question! You don't understand; I used to think, indeed, thatyooif women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as isyoomaintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, Iyooreflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,yoofor there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting isyoounthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equalityyooin fighting. I am not so stupid... though, of course, there isyoofighting... there won't be later, but at present there is... confoundyooit! How muddled one gets with you! It's not on that account that Iyooam not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in theyoorevolting convention of memorial dinners, that's why! Though, of course,yooone might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there won't be any priests atyooit. I should certainly go if there were."yooyoo"Then you would sit down at another man's table and insult it and thoseyoowho invited you. Eh?"yooyoo"Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. Iyoomight indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It'syooa duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and theyoomore harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... Andyoosomething might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?yooThey might be offended at first, but afterwards they'd see I'd done themyooa service. You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamedyoobecause when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote toyooher father and mother that she wouldn't go on living conventionally andyoowas entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,yoothat she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I thinkyoothat's all nonsense and there's no need of softness; on the contrary,yoowhat's wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, sheyooabandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in ayooletter: 'I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can neveryooforgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that thereyoois another organisation of society by means of the communities. I haveyooonly lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have givenyoomyself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainlyyoobecause I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.yooDo not hope to get me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.'yooThat's how letters like that ought to be written!"yooyoo"Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?"yooyoo"No, it's only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, whatyooif it were the fifteenth, that's all nonsense! And if ever I regrettedyoothe death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes thinkyooif my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! Iyoowould have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I wouldyoohave astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!"yooyoo"To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will," Pyotr Petrovitchyoointerrupted, "but tell me this; do you know the dead man's daughter, theyoodelicate-looking little thing? It's true what they say about her, isn'tyooit?"yooyoo"What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction thatyoothis is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, _distinguons_.yooIn our present society it is not altogether normal, because it isyoocompulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,yoobecause it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she was quite right: sheyoowas suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital whichyooshe had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the futureyoosociety there will be no need of assets, but her part will have anotheryoosignificance, rational and in harmony with her environment. As to SofyayooSemyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest againstyoothe organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoiceyooindeed when I look at her!"yooyoo"I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings."yooyooLebeziatnikov was enraged.yooyoo"That's another slander," he yelled. "It was not so at all! That was allyooKaterina Ivanovna's invention, for she did not understand! And I neveryoomade love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirelyyoodisinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was heryooprotest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!"yooyoo"Have you asked her to join your community?"yooyoo"You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tellyooyou. You don't understand! There is no such rôle in a community. Theyoocommunity is established that there should be no such rôles. In ayoocommunity, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupidyoohere is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnaturalyoobecomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on theyooenvironment. It's all the environment and man himself is nothing. AndyooI am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proofyoothat she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now toyooattract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.yooWhat are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community ofyooour own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in ouryooconvictions. We reject more! And meanwhile I'm still developing SofyayooSemyonovna. She has a beautiful, beautiful character!"yooyoo"And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-he!"yooyoo"No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary."yooyoo"Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!"yooyoo"Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it strange myselfyoohow timid, chaste and modern she is with me!"yooyoo"And you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to heryoothat all that modesty is nonsense?"yooyoo"Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me sayingyooso--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crudeyooyou still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you haveyooonly one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general questionyooof chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeedyooprejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that's for heryooto decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,yooI should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; butyooas it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with moreyoorespect for her dignity... I wait in hopes, that's all!"yooyoo"You had much better make her a present of something. I bet you neveryoothought of that."yooyoo"You don't understand, as I've told you already! Of course, she is inyoosuch a position, but it's another question. Quite another question!yooYou simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consideryoodeserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellowyoocreature. You don't know what a character she is! I am only sorry thatyooof late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I usedyooto lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the energy andyooresolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she hasyoolittle self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as toyoobreak free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet sheyoothoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing ofyoohands, that is, that it's an insult to a woman for a man to kiss heryoohand, because it's a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it andyooI described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of theyooworkmen's associations in France, too. Now I am explaining the questionyooof coming into the room in the future society."yooyoo"And what's that, pray?"yooyoo"We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the communityyoothe right to enter another member's room, whether man or woman, at anyyootime... and we decided that he has!"yooyoo"It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!"yooyooLebeziatnikov was really angry.yooyoo"You are always thinking of something unpleasant," he cried withyooaversion. "Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, Iyooreferred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It's alwaysyooa stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule beforeyoothey understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I've oftenyoomaintained that that question should not be approached by a novice tillyoohe has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do youyoofind so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be readyyooto clean out any cesspool you like. And it's not a question ofyooself-sacrifice, it's simply work, honourable, useful work which isyooas good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and ayooPushkin, because it is more useful."yooyoo"And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!"yooyoo"What do you mean by 'more honourable'? I don't understand suchyooexpressions to describe human activity. 'More honourable,' 'nobler'--allyoothose are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which isyoo_of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!yooYou can snigger as much as you like, but that's so!"yooyooPyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the moneyyooand was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. Theyoo"cesspool question" had already been a subject of dispute between them.yooWhat was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while ityooamused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger hisyooyoung friend.yooyoo"It's your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured andyooannoying," blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his "independence"yooand his "protests" did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and stillyoobehaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.yooyoo"You'd better tell me this," Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughtyyoodispleasure, "can you... or rather are you really friendly enough withyoothat young person to ask her to step in here for a minute? I thinkyoothey've all come back from the cemetery... I heard the sound ofyoosteps... I want to see her, that young person."yooyoo"What for?" Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.yooyoo"Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore Iyoowanted to speak to her about... However, you may be present during theyoointerview. It's better you should be, indeed. For there's no knowingyoowhat you might imagine."yooyoo"I shan't imagine anything. I only asked and, if you've anything to sayyooto her, nothing is easier than to call her in. I'll go directly and youyoomay be sure I won't be in your way."yooyooFive minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in veryyoomuch surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy inyoosuch circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been asyooa child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her "politelyyooand affably," but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which inyoohis opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weightyooin dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. Heyoohastened to "reassure" her and made her sit down facing him at theyootable. Sonia sat down, looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notesyoolying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyesyooremained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. PyotryooPetrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.yooyoo"Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?" he asked him in a whisper.yooyoo"Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in....yooWhy?"yooyoo"Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leaveyoome alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her,yoobut God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn't like Raskolnikov toyoorepeat anything.... You understand what I mean?"yooyoo"I understand!" Lebeziatnikov saw the point. "Yes, you are right.... Ofyoocourse, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy,yoobut... still, you are right. Certainly I'll stay. I'll stand here at theyoowindow and not be in your way... I think you are right..."yooyooPyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, lookedyooattentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severeyooexpression, as much as to say, "don't you make any mistake, madam."yooSonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.yooyoo"In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to youryoorespected mamma.... That's right, isn't it? Katerina Ivanovna standsyooin the place of a mother to you?" Pyotr Petrovitch began with greatyoodignity, though affably.yooyooIt was evident that his intentions were friendly.yooyoo"Quite so, yes; the place of a mother," Sonia answered, timidly andyoohurriedly.yooyoo"Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevitableyoocircumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner inyoospite of your mamma's kind invitation."yooyoo"Yes... I'll tell her... at once."yooyooAnd Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.yooyoo"Wait, that's not all," Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at heryoosimplicity and ignorance of good manners, "and you know me little, myyoodear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to troubleyooa person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myselfyooonly. I have another object."yooyooSonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on theyoogrey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but sheyooquickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt ityoohorribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person'syoomoney. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch heldyooin his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with ayooyellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and, notyooknowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straightyooin the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.yooyoo"I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words withyooKaterina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me toyooascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may soyooexpress it."yooyoo"Yes... preternatural..." Sonia hurriedly assented.yooyoo"Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill."yooyoo"Yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill."yooyoo"Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speakyoocompassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,yooforeseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of thisyoopoverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?"yooyoo"Allow me to ask," Sonia rose to her feet, "did you say something to heryooyesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you hadyooundertaken to get her one. Was that true?"yooyoo"Not in the slightest, and indeed it's an absurdity! I merely hinted atyooher obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who hadyoodied in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently youryoolate parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in theyooservice at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would beyoovery ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance inyoothat case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,yoohe-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!"yooyoo"Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believesyooeverything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is likeyoothat... yes... You must excuse her," said Sonia, and again she got up toyoogo.yooyoo"But you haven't heard what I have to say."yooyoo"No, I haven't heard," muttered Sonia.yooyoo"Then sit down." She was terribly confused; she sat down again a thirdyootime.yooyoo"Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,yooas I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,yoothat is, so far as is in my power, not more. One might for instance getyooup a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such asyoois always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirousyooof assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it mightyoobe done."yooyoo"Yes, yes... God will repay you for it," faltered Sonia, gazing intentlyyooat Pyotr Petrovitch.yooyoo"It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, weyoowill talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Comeyooto me at seven o'clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. Butyoothere is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand andyoofor which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. Inyoomy opinion money cannot be, indeed it's unsafe to put it into KaterinayooIvanovna's own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though sheyoohas not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, bootsyooor shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,yooI believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.yooTo-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won't have a crust ofyoobread. It's absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription oughtyooto be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, butyooonly you, for instance. Am I right?"yooyoo"I don't know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She wasyooso anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is veryyoosensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they willyooall be... and God will reward... and the orphans..."yooyooSonia burst into tears.yooyoo"Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for theyoobenefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from meyoopersonally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned inyooconnection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, Iyoocannot do more..."yooyooAnd Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefullyyoounfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered somethingyooand began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniouslyyooto the door. She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,yooand returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.yooyooAll this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about theyooroom, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone heyoowalked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.yooyoo"I heard and _saw_ everything," he said, laying stress on the last verb.yoo"That is honourable, I mean to say, it's humane! You wanted to avoidyoogratitude, I saw! And although I cannot, I confess, in principleyoosympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate theyooevil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action withyoopleasure--yes, yes, I like it."yooyoo"That's all nonsense," muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted,yoolooking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.yooyoo"No, it's not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance asyooyou did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,yoosuch a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is stillyoodeserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, PyotryooPetrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawbackyooyour ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by youryooill-luck yesterday," cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who feltyooa return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. "And, what do you want withyoomarriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why doyooyou cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well, you may beat me if youyoolike, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn't come off, that you areyoofree, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, I've spokenyoomy mind!"yooyoo"Because I don't want in your free marriage to be made a fool of andyooto bring up another man's children, that's why I want legal marriage,"yooLuzhin replied in order to make some answer.yooyooHe seemed preoccupied by something.yooyoo"Children? You referred to children," Lebeziatnikov started off likeyooa warhorse at the trumpet call. "Children are a social question and ayooquestion of first importance, I agree; but the question of children hasyooanother solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because theyyoosuggest the institution of the family. We'll speak of children later,yoobut now as to the question of honour, I confess that's my weak point.yooThat horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in theyoodictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It's nonsense,yoothere will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the naturalyooconsequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.yooSo that indeed it's not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose anyooabsurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad ofyooit. I should say to my wife: 'My dear, hitherto I have loved you, nowyooI respect you, for you've shown you can protest!' You laugh! That'syoobecause you are of incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confoundyooit all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceivedyooin a legal marriage, but it's simply a despicable consequence of ayoodespicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception isyooopen, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it's unthinkable.yooYour wife will only prove how she respects you by considering youyooincapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her foryooher new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,yoopfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it's just the same,yooI should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one foryooherself. 'My dear,' I should say, 'I love you, but even more than that Iyoodesire you to respect me. See!' Am I not right?"yooyooPyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.yooHe hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else andyooeven Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excitedyooand rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflectedyooupon it afterwards.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIyooyooIt would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated theyooidea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna's disordered brain.yooNearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov'syoofuneral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged toyoohonour the memory of the deceased "suitably," that all the lodgers,yooand still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know "that he was in no way theiryooinferior, and perhaps very much their superior," and that no one had theyooright "to turn up his nose at him." Perhaps the chief element was thatyoopeculiar "poor man's pride," which compels many poor people to spendyootheir last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in orderyooto do "like other people," and not to "be looked down upon." It is veryyooprobable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, atyoothe moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show thoseyoo"wretched contemptible lodgers" that she knew "how to do things, howyooto entertain" and that she had been brought up "in a genteel, she mightyooalmost say aristocratic colonel's family" and had not been meant foryoosweeping floors and washing the children's rags at night. Even theyoopoorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to theseyooparoxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistibleyoonervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; sheyoomight have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not haveyoobeen broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her willyoocould not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that heryoomind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a yearyoopast she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.yooThe later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect theyoointellect.yooyooThere was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wineyoothere was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorestyooquality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice andyoohoney, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted ofyoopancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna's kitchen. Two samovars wereyooboiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. KaterinayooIvanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the helpyooof one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow beenyoostranded at Madame Lippevechsel's. He promptly put himself at KaterinayooIvanovna's disposal and had been all that morning and all the day beforeyoorunning about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxiousyoothat everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to KaterinayooIvanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant calledyooher "_Pani_." She was heartily sick of him before the end, thoughyooshe had declared at first that she could not have got on without thisyoo"serviceable and magnanimous man." It was one of Katerina Ivanovna'syoocharacteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.yooHer praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; sheyoowould invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintanceyooand quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden sheyoowould be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse theyooperson she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. Sheyoowas naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but fromyoocontinual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_yoothat all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break theyoopeace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almostyooto frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes andyoofancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head againstyoothe wall.yooyooAmalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance inyooKaterina Ivanovna's eyes and was treated by her with extraordinaryyoorespect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heartyooand soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,yooto provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in heryookitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and goneyooherself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even theyootable-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glassesyoowere, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,yoobut the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,yoofeeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress andyooa cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with someyoopride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna foryoosome reason: "as though the table could not have been laid except byyooAmalia Ivanovna!" She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. "Could sheyoobe stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,yooand had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!yooFancy that! Katerina Ivanovna's father who had been a colonel and almostyooa governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and thenyooanyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have beenyooallowed into the kitchen."yooyooKaterina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for theyootime and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decidedyooinwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna downyooand set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she wasyoofancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact thatyoohardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, exceptyoothe Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to theyoomemorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turnedyooup, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The olderyooand more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.yooPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the mostyoorespectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovnayoohad the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,yooPolenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,yoonoble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who hadyoobeen a friend of her first husband's, and a guest in her father'syoohouse, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure heryooa considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovnayooexalted anyone's connections and fortune, it was without any ulterioryoomotive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding toyoothe consequence of the person praised. Probably "taking his cue" fromyooLuzhin, "that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned upyooeither. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindnessyooand because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was ayoofriend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him."yooyooAmong those who failed to appear were "the genteel lady and heryooold-maidish daughter," who had only been lodgers in the house for theyoolast fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproaryooin Katerina Ivanovna's room, especially when Marmeladov had comeyooback drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,yooquarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the wholeyoofamily out of doors, had shouted at her that they "were not worth theyoofoot" of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing. KaterinayooIvanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, "whoseyoofoot she was not worth," and who had turned away haughtily when sheyoocasually met them, so that they might know that "she was more noble inyooher thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice," and might seeyoothat she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed toyoomake this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father'syoogovernorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedinglyyoostupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (heyoowas really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but ityooappeared that he had been "not himself" for the last two days. The partyyooconsisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face andyooa greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smeltyooabominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in theyoopost office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someoneyooat Amalia Ivanovna's.yooyooA retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he wasyoodrunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was withoutyooa waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table withoutyooeven greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suityooappeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts ofyooAmalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole broughtyoowith him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna'syooand whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated KaterinayooIvanovna intensely. "For whom had they made all these preparationsyoothen?" To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laidyoofor at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in theyoofurthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a bigyoogirl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped likeyoowell-bred children's.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests withyooincreased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them withyoospecial severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushingyooto the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those whoyoowere absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which theyoolatter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omenyoofor the end. All were seated at last.yooyooRaskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from theyoocemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in theyoofirst place, because he was the one "educated visitor, and, as everyoneyooknew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university," andyoosecondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for havingyoobeen unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, andyoomade him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). Inyoospite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed roundyoocorrectly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonisingyoocough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worseyooduring the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper toyooRaskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation atyoothe failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively andyoouncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially ofyooher landlady.yooyoo"It's all that cuckoo's fault! You know whom I mean? Her, her!" KaterinayooIvanovna nodded towards the landlady. "Look at her, she's making roundyooeyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can't understand.yooPfoo, the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on thatyoocap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyoneyooto consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by beingyoohere? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especiallyyoothose who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she hasyoobrought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And thoseyoowretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has everyoopoked his nose in here, I've never set eyes on them. What have they comeyoohere for, I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey, _pan_!" she criedyoosuddenly to one of them, "have you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!yooHave some beer! Won't you have some vodka? Look, he's jumped up and isyoomaking his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things. Never mind,yoolet them eat! They don't make a noise, anyway, though I'm really afraidyoofor our landlady's silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!" she addressed heryoosuddenly, almost aloud, "if your spoons should happen to be stolen,yooI won't be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!" She laughed turning toyooRaskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at heryoosally. "She didn't understand, she didn't understand again! Look howyooshe sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons,yooha-ha-ha!"yooyooHere her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing thatyoolasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her foreheadyooand her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikovyoothe blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath beganyoowhispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on heryoocheeks.yooyoo"Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,yoofor inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I amyoospeaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but sheyoohas managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, thatyooprovincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, andyoohas come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in theyoogovernment offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybodyyooknows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and hasyoonot even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good mannersyoorequired! I can't understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? Butyoowhere's Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it,yooSonia, where have you been? It's odd that even at your father's funeralyooyou should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for heryoobeside you. That's your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some ofyoothe cold entrée with jelly, that's the best. They'll bring the pancakesyoodirectly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you gotyooeverything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That's all right. Be a good girl, Lida,yooand, Kolya, don't fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.yooWhat are you saying, Sonia?"yooyooSonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch's apologies, trying toyoospeak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the mostyoorespectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She addedyoothat Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon asyoohe possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ aloneyoowith her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc.yooyooSonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter heryooand gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him ayoohurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the timeyooshe seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemedyooabsent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, tryingyooto please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to getyoomourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on heryooonly dress, a dark striped cotton one.yooyooThe message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening toyooSonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity howyooPyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud toyooRaskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man ofyooPyotr Petrovitch's position and standing to find himself in suchyoo"extraordinary company," in spite of his devotion to her family and hisyooold friendship with her father.yooyoo"That's why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you haveyoonot disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings," she addedyooalmost aloud. "But I am sure that it was only your special affection foryoomy poor husband that has made you keep your promise."yooyooThen once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, andyoosuddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: "Wouldn't heyoohave some more meat, and had he been given some wine?" The old man madeyoono answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,yoothough his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. Heyoosimply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased theyoogeneral mirth.yooyoo"What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to PyotryooPetrovitch, I always had confidence in him," Katerina Ivanovnayoocontinued, "and, of course, he is not like..." with an extremely sternyooface she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latteryoowas quite disconcerted, "not like your dressed up draggletails whomyoomy father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my lateyoohusband would have done them honour if he had invited them in theyoogoodness of his heart."yooyoo"Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!" cried theyoocommissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.yooyoo"My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knowsyooit," Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, "but he was a kind andyoohonourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it wasyoohis good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and heyoodrank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would youyoobelieve it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in hisyoopocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!"yooyoo"A cock? Did you say a cock?" shouted the commissariat clerk.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost inyoothought.yooyoo"No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him," sheyoowent on, addressing Raskolnikov. "But that's not so! He respected me, heyoorespected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I wasyoofor him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used toyoofeel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then wouldyoothink to myself: 'Be kind to him and he will drink again,' it was onlyyooby severity that you could keep him within bounds."yooyoo"Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often," roared theyoocommissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.yooyoo"Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as havingyootheir hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!" KaterinayooIvanovna snapped at him.yooyooThe flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. Inyooanother minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of theyoovisitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking theyoocommissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidentlyyootrying to egg him on.yooyoo"Allow me to ask what are you alluding to," began the clerk, "that isyooto say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I don't care!yooThat's nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!"yooyooAnd he took another drink of vodka.yooyooRaskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only ate fromyoopoliteness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continuallyyooputting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Soniayoointently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,yootoo, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw withyooterror Katerina Ivanovna's growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,yoowas the chief reason for the 'genteel' ladies' contemptuous treatment ofyooKaterina Ivanovna's invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna thatyoothe mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked theyooquestion: "How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that youngyooperson_?" Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heardyoothis and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than anyooinsult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew thatyooKaterina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, "till she had shown thoseyoodraggletails that they were both..." To make matters worse someoneyoopassed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two heartsyoopierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushedyoocrimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent ityoowas "a drunken ass!"yooyooAmalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same timeyoodeeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna's haughtiness, and to restore theyoogood-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,yooapropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers "Karlyoofrom the chemist's," who was driving one night in a cab, and that "theyoocabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,yooand wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced hisyooheart." Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once thatyooAmalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter wasyoostill more offended, and she retorted that her "_Vater aus Berlin_ was ayoovery important man, and always went with his hands in pockets." KaterinayooIvanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that AmaliayooIvanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.yooyoo"Listen to the owl!" Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, heryoogood-humour almost restored, "she meant to say he kept his hands inyoohis pockets, but she said he put his hands in people's pockets.yoo(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all theseyooPetersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider thanyoowe! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how 'Karl from the chemist's'yoo'pierced his heart from fear' and that the idiot, instead of punishingyoothe cabman, 'clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.' Ah, the fool!yooAnd you know she fancies it's very touching and does not suspect howyoostupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a greatyoodeal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains withyoodrink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behavedyooand serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry, ha-ha!yoo(Cough-cough-cough.)"yooyooRegaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once tellingyooRaskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to openyooa school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.yooThis was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and sheyoolaunched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared thatyooKaterina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour ofyoowhich Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he toldyoohim that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl danceyoobefore the governor and other great personages on leaving school. Thisyoocertificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove KaterinayooIvanovna's right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herselfyoowith it chiefly with the object of overwhelming "those two stuck-upyoodraggletails" if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestablyyoothat Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, "she might even sayyooaristocratic family, a colonel's daughter and was far superior toyoocertain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late." Theyoocertificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunkenyooguests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actuallyyoocontained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of theyoorank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she reallyyoowas almost the daughter of a colonel.yooyooWarming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful andyoohappy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whomyooshe would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a mostyoorespectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovnayooherself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubtyooteach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who wouldyoogo with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone atyoothe further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.yooyooThough Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware ofyooit, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction ofyooSonia's undoubted ability to assist her, of "her gentleness, patience,yoodevotion, generosity and good education," tapping Sonia on the cheek andyookissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovnayoosuddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was "nervousyooand silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, andyooas the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea."yooyooAt that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part inyoothe conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,yooand with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weightyyooobservation, that "in the future boarding-school she would have to payyooparticular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be ayoogood _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladiesyoomust not novels at night read."yooyooKaterina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well asyooheartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, sayingyoo"she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was theyoobusiness of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-classyooboarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,yoothat was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent." AmaliayooIvanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only "meant heryoogood," and that "she had meant her very good," and that "it was longyoosince she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings."yooyooKaterina Ivanovna at once "set her down," saying that it was a lie toyoosay she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husbandyoowas lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To thisyooAmalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited thoseyooladies, but "those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_yooladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady." Katerina Ivanovnayooat once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judgeyoowhat made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that heryoo"_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands inyoopockets went, and always used to say: 'Poof! poof!'" and she leaptyooup from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in heryoopockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling "poof!yoopoof!" amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouragedyooAmalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.yooyooBut this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,yooso that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had ayoofather, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly onceyoobeen a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as redyooas a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had ayoofather, "but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coatyooand always said poof-poof-poof!"yooyooKaterina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her familyyoowas and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in printyoothat her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna's father--if sheyooreally had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably sheyoonever had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her nameyoowas Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.yooyooAt this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,yooand shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, "thatyooher _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and thatyooKaterina Ivanovna's _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister." KaterinayooIvanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voiceyoo(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that "if sheyoodared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on ayoolevel with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off heryoohead and trample it under foot." Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,yooshouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house andyoothat Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then sheyoorushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.yooThere was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Soniayooran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shoutedyoosomething about "the yellow ticket," Katerina Ivanovna pushed Soniayooaway, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.yooyooAt that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appearedyooon the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilantyooeyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIIyooyoo"Pyotr Petrovitch," she cried, "protect me... you at least! Make thisyoofoolish woman understand that she can't behave like this to a lady inyoomisfortune... that there is a law for such things.... I'll go to theyoogovernor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering myyoofather's hospitality protect these orphans."yooyoo"Allow me, madam.... Allow me." Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. "Youryoopapa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing" (someoneyoolaughed aloud) "and I do not intend to take part in your everlastingyoosquabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my ownyooaffairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...yooIvanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass."yooyooPyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Soniayoowas.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as thoughyoothunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could denyyoohaving enjoyed her father's hospitality. Though she had invented ityooherself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck tooyooby the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of PyotryooPetrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Notyooonly was this "serious business man" strikingly incongruous with theyoorest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon someyoomatter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought himyooand that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standingyoobeside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did notyooseem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in theyoodoorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with markedyoointerest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.yooyoo"Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it's a matter ofyoosome importance," Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the companyyoogenerally. "I am glad indeed to find other persons present. AmaliayooIvanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay carefulyooattention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,"yoohe went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and alreadyyooalarmed, "immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-roubleyoonote was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.yooLebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us whereyooit is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present toyoowitness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall beyoocompelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you mustyooblame yourself."yooyooComplete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children wereyoostill. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say ayooword. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.yooyoo"Well, how is it to be then?" asked Luzhin, looking intently at her.yooyoo"I don't know.... I know nothing about it," Sonia articulated faintly atyoolast.yooyoo"No, you know nothing?" Luzhin repeated and again he paused for someyooseconds. "Think a moment, mademoiselle," he began severely, but still,yooas it were, admonishing her. "Reflect, I am prepared to give you timeyoofor consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirelyyooconvinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture toyooaccuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation beforeyoowitnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain senseyoobe made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed foryoomy own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum ofyooapproximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in myyoopocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.yooLebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand threeyoohundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.yooAbout five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them threeyoonotes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at myyooinvitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedinglyyooembarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of theyooconversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witnessyooto this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirmyoomy statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely inyooorder to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of youryoorelative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),yooand the advisability of getting up something of the nature of ayoosubscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me andyooeven shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily toyoorecall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightestyoodetail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note fromyoothe table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my partyoofor the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. ThenyooI accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state ofyooembarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov Iyootalked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and Iyooreturned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to countyooit and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise oneyoohundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.yooMr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to suchyooa supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for theyoominute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found theyoototal correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, youryooeagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for someyootime on the table, and taking into consideration your social positionyooand the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror andyoopositively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--ayoocruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that inyoospite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk inyoomaking this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I haveyootaken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owingyooto your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of youryoodestitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles andyooyou, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is tooyoobad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I begyooyou--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what youyooare doing, otherwise I shall be immovable! Well, what do you say?"yooyoo"I have taken nothing," Sonia whispered in terror, "you gave me tenyooroubles, here it is, take it."yooyooSonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,yootook out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.yooyoo"And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?" he insistedyooreproachfully, not taking the note.yooyooSonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,yooironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood againstyoothe wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.yooyoo"Good God!" broke from Sonia.yooyoo"Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and thereforeyooI humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter," Luzhin saidyoosoftly and even kindly.yooyoo"_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief," cried AmaliayooIvanovna, throwing up her hands.yooyoo"You knew it?" Luzhin caught her up, "then I suppose you had some reasonyoobefore this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, toyooremember your words which have been uttered before witnesses."yooyooThere was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were inyoomovement.yooyoo"What!" cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, andyooshe rushed at Luzhin. "What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, theyoowretches, the wretches!"yooyooAnd running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her asyooin a vise.yooyoo"Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give ityooto me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!"yooyooAnd snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up andyooflung it straight into Luzhin's face. It hit him in the eye and fellyooon the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitchyoolost his temper.yooyoo"Hold that mad woman!" he shouted.yooyooAt that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared inyoothe doorway, among them the two ladies.yooyoo"What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!" shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. "You are anyooidiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take hisyoomoney! Sonia a thief! Why, she'd give away her last penny!" and KaterinayooIvanovna broke into hysterical laughter. "Did you ever see such anyooidiot?" she turned from side to side. "And you too?" she suddenly sawyoothe landlady, "and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is ayoothief, you trashy Prussian hen's leg in a crinoline! She hasn't beenyooout of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat downyoobeside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Searchyooher! Since she's not left the room, the money would have to be on her!yooSearch her, search her! But if you don't find it, then excuse me, myyoodear fellow, you'll answer for it! I'll go to our Sovereign, to ouryooSovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,yooto-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Doyooyou think they wouldn't? You're wrong, I will get in! I will get in!yooYou reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not soyoosubmissive, let me tell you! You've gone too far yourself. Search her,yoosearch her!"yooyooAnd Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towardsyooSonia.yooyoo"I am ready, I'll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calmyooyourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as toyoothat..." Luzhin muttered, "that ought to be before the police... thoughyooindeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But inyooany case it's difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But withyoothe help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it's not the way to doyoothings.... How is it to be done?"yooyoo"As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!" cried Katerina Ivanovna.yoo"Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,yoohere was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! D'you see,yood'you see?"yooyooAnd Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets insideyooout. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describingyooa parabola in the air fell at Luzhin's feet. Everyone saw it, severalyoocried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in twoyoofingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was ayoohundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the noteyooshowing it to everyone.yooyoo"Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!" yelled Amalia Ivanovna.yoo"They must to Siberia be sent! Away!"yooyooExclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping hisyooeyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.yooSonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feelyoosurprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cryyooand hid her face in her hands.yooyoo"No, it wasn't I! I didn't take it! I know nothing about it," she criedyoowith a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who claspedyooher tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all theyooworld.yooyoo"Sonia! Sonia! I don't believe it! You see, I don't believe it!" sheyoocried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in heryooarms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at heryoohands and kissing them, too, "you took it! How stupid these people are!yooOh dear! You are fools, fools," she cried, addressing the whole room,yoo"you don't know, you don't know what a heart she has, what a girl sheyoois! She take it, she? She'd sell her last rag, she'd go barefoot to helpyooyou if you needed it, that's what she is! She has the yellow passportyoobecause my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,yoohusband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!yooMerciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? RodionyooRomanovitch, why don't you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? Youyooare not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defendyooher now, at least!"yooyooThe wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce ayoogreat effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,yoothe parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrainedyooas a child's, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for helpyoowere so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitchyooat any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.yooyoo"Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!" he criedyooimpressively, "no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being anyooinstigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have provedyooher guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previousyooidea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,yooso to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse toyooconfess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?yooYou lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But howyoocould you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen," heyooaddressed the whole company, "gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,yoocommiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spiteyooof the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be ayoolesson to you for the future," he said, addressing Sonia, "and I willyoocarry the matter no further. Enough!"yooyooPyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and theyoofire in Raskolnikov's seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. MeanwhileyooKaterina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and huggingyooSonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia onyooall sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what wasyoowrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her prettyyoolittle face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia's shoulder.yooyoo"How vile!" a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.yooyooPyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.yooyoo"What vileness!" Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in theyooface.yooyooPyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled ityooafterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.yooyoo"And you dared to call me as witness?" he said, going up to PyotryooPetrovitch.yooyoo"What do you mean? What are you talking about?" muttered Luzhin.yooyoo"I mean that you... are a slanderer, that's what my words mean!"yooLebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sightedyooeyes.yooyooHe was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as thoughyooseizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. PyotryooPetrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.yooyoo"If you mean that for me,..." he began, stammering. "But what's theyoomatter with you? Are you out of your mind?"yooyoo"I'm in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heardyooeverything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must ownyooeven now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for Iyoocan't understand."yooyoo"Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensicalyooriddles! Or maybe you are drunk!"yooyoo"You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touchyoovodka, for it's against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, heyoohimself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-roubleyoonote--I saw it, I was a witness, I'll take my oath! He did it, he!"yoorepeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.yooyoo"Are you crazy, milksop?" squealed Luzhin. "She is herself beforeyooyou--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave heryooonly ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?"yooyoo"I saw it, I saw it," Lebeziatnikov repeated, "and though it is againstyoomy principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you likeyoobefore the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Onlyyoolike a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were sayingyoogood-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, withyoothe other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, Iyoosaw it!"yooyooLuzhin turned pale.yooyoo"What lies!" he cried impudently, "why, how could you, standing by theyoowindow, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. Youyooare raving!"yooyoo"No, I didn't fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I sawyooit all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note fromyoothe window--that's true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-roubleyoonote, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,yooyou took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because Iyoowas standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did notyooforget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your handyooall the time. I didn't think of it again until, when you were gettingyooup, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly droppedyooit! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meantyooto do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched youyooand I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, Iyoosaw it, I'll take my oath."yooyooLebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all handsyoochiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They allyoocrowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.yooyoo"I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take heryoopart! She is an orphan. God has sent you!"yooyooKaterina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her kneesyoobefore him.yooyoo"A pack of nonsense!" yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, "it's all nonsenseyooyou've been talking! 'An idea struck you, you didn't think, youyoonoticed'--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly onyoopurpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?"yooyoo"What for? That's what I can't understand, but that what I am tellingyooyou is the fact, that's certain! So far from my being mistaken, youyooinfamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a questionyoooccurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressingyooyour hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did ityoosecretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing thatyoomy convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of privateyoobenevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that youyooreally were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,yootoo, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a wholeyoohundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent peopleyooare very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Thenyoothe idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,yoowhen she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that youyoowanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right handyooshould not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of soyoomany possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought ityooindelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struckyoome again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before sheyoonoticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out ofyoothe room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.yooBut on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov's to take them theyoo'General Treatise on the Positive Method' and especially to recommendyooPiderit's article (and also Wagner's); then I come on here and what ayoostate of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these ideas andyooreflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in heryoopocket?"yooyooWhen Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logicalyoodeduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamedyoofrom his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctlyyooin Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quiteyooexhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speechyooproduced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with suchyooconviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch feltyoothat things were going badly with him.yooyoo"What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?" he shouted,yoo"that's no evidence. You may have dreamt it, that's all! And I tell you,yooyou are lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite againstyoome, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,yoogodless, social propositions!"yooyooBut this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapprovalyoowere heard on all sides.yooyoo"Ah, that's your line now, is it!" cried Lebeziatnikov, "that'syoononsense! Call the police and I'll take my oath! There's only one thingyooI can't understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh,yoopitiful, despicable man!"yooyoo"I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,yoowill swear to it," Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and heyoostepped forward.yooyooHe appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from theyoovery look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery wouldyoobe solved.yooyoo"Now I can explain it all to myself," said Raskolnikov, addressingyooLebeziatnikov. "From the very beginning of the business, I suspectedyoothat there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I beganyooto suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, whichyooI will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Youryoovaluable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,yooall to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recentlyyooengaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya RomanovnayooRaskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the dayyoobefore yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--Iyoohave two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The dayyoobefore yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,yooand that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day beforeyooyesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,yooas a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note toyoomy mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, notyooto Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a mostyoocontemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,yoohinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this youyoounderstand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,yooby insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the moneyyoowhich they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,yoobefore my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I hadyoogiven the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to SofyayooSemyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and hadyoonever seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,yooPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth SofyayooSemyonovna's little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To hisyooquestion--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, Iyooanswered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my motheryooand sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, heyoogradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture tookyooplace and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterdayyooevening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had nowyoosucceeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he wouldyoohave shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in hisyoosuspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister onyooa level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protectingyooand preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he mightyooeven, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,yooand no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothingyooof revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposingyoothat the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious toyoome. That was what he was working for! That's how I understand it. That'syoothe whole reason for it and there can be no other!"yooyooIt was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up hisyoospeech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted byyooexclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spokeyooclearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone ofyooconviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.yooyoo"Yes, yes, that's it," Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, "that must beyooit, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,yoowhether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna'syooguests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It wasyooessential for him that you should be here! That's it, that's it!"yooyooLuzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. Heyooseemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would haveyoobeen glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment thisyoowas scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth ofyoothe accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which hadyooalready been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. Theyoocommissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,yoowas shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions veryyoounpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers cameyooin from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excitedyooand were continually shouting at him: "The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!" andyoomuttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strainedyooattention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed asyoothough she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take heryooeyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. KaterinayooIvanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.yooAmalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouthyoowide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that PyotryooPetrovitch had somehow come to grief.yooyooRaskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.yooEveryone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.yooBut Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation ofyooSonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:yooyoo"Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don't squeeze, let me pass!" he said,yoomaking his way through the crowd. "And no threats, if you please! Iyooassure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On theyoocontrary, you'll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructingyoothe course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and Iyooshall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, andyoowill not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, andyooatheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they areyoofoolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!"yooyoo"Don't let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, andyooeverything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I'veyoobeen taking, the way I've been expounding... all this fortnight!"yooyoo"I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;yoonow I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctoryoofor your brains and your short sight. Let me pass, gentlemen!"yooyooHe forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling toyoolet him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandishedyooit in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flewyoostraight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,yoofell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his roomyooand half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, hadyoofelt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily thanyooanyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till thatyoomoment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,yoogentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment wasyootoo great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost withoutyoomurmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it tooyoobitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her firstyooterror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it allyooclearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to heryoomade her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hystericalyooweeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the roomyooand ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin's departure. When amidstyooloud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than theyoolandlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at KaterinayooIvanovna, considering her to blame for everything.yooyoo"Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!"yooyooAnd with these words she began snatching up everything she could layyooher hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on theyoofloor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,yoojumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted atyooAmalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved heryooaway like a feather.yooyoo"What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creatureyooattacks me! What! On the day of my husband's funeral I am turned out ofyoomy lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,yoowith my orphans! Where am I to go?" wailed the poor woman, sobbing andyoogasping. "Good God!" she cried with flashing eyes, "is there no justiceyooupon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!yooThere is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,yoogodless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I'll come back. Waityoofor me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there isyoojustice on earth!"yooyooAnd throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov hadyoomentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through theyoodisorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,yoowailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intentionyooof going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two littleyooones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of theyooroom, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. AmaliayooIvanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwingyooeverything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talkedyooincoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what hadyoohappened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while othersyoostruck up a song....yooyoo"Now it's time for me to go," thought Raskolnikov. "Well, SofyayooSemyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!"yooyooAnd he set off in the direction of Sonia's lodgings.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IVyooyooRaskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia againstyooLuzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his ownyooheart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sortyooof relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personalyoofeeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,yooespecially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interviewyoowith Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew theyooterrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away theyoothought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna's, "Well,yooSofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!" he was stillyoosuperficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph overyooLuzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia's lodging, heyoofelt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at theyoodoor, asking himself the strange question: "Must he tell her who killedyooLizaveta?" It was a strange question because he felt at the very timeyoonot only that he could not help telling her, but also that he couldyoonot put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, heyooonly _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence beforeyoothe inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation andyoosuffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from theyoodoorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face inyooher hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meetyoohim as though she were expecting him.yooyoo"What would have become of me but for you?" she said quickly, meetingyoohim in the middle of the room.yooyooEvidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had beenyoowaiting for.yooyooRaskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which sheyoohad only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as sheyoohad done the day before.yooyoo"Well, Sonia?" he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, "it wasyooall due to 'your social position and the habits associated with it.' Didyooyou understand that just now?"yooyooHer face showed her distress.yooyoo"Only don't talk to me as you did yesterday," she interrupted him.yoo"Please don't begin it. There is misery enough without that."yooyooShe made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.yooyoo"I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? Iyoowanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come."yooyooHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodgingyooand that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere "to seek justice."yooyoo"My God!" cried Sonia, "let's go at once...."yooyooAnd she snatched up her cape.yooyoo"It's everlastingly the same thing!" said Raskolnikov, irritably.yoo"You've no thought except for them! Stay a little with me."yooyoo"But... Katerina Ivanovna?"yooyoo"You won't lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she'll come to youyooherself since she has run out," he added peevishly. "If she doesn't findyooyou here, you'll be blamed for it...."yooyooSonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing atyoothe floor and deliberating.yooyoo"This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you," he began, not lookingyooat Sonia, "but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he wouldyoohave sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.yooAh?"yooyoo"Yes," she assented in a faint voice. "Yes," she repeated, preoccupiedyooand distressed.yooyoo"But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accidentyooLebeziatnikov's turning up."yooyooSonia was silent.yooyoo"And if you'd gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I saidyooyesterday?"yooyooAgain she did not answer. He waited.yooyoo"I thought you would cry out again 'don't speak of it, leave off.'"yooRaskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. "What, silenceyooagain?" he asked a minute later. "We must talk about something, youyooknow. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide ayoocertain 'problem' as Lebeziatnikov would say." (He was beginning to loseyoothe thread.) "No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you hadyooknown all Luzhin's intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,yoothat they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children andyooyourself thrown in--since you don't count yourself for anything--Polenkayootoo... for she'll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended onyooyour decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whetheryooLuzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovnayooshould die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?"yooyooSonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in thisyoohesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundaboutyooway.yooyoo"I felt that you were going to ask some question like that," she said,yoolooking inquisitively at him.yooyoo"I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?"yooyoo"Why do you ask about what could not happen?" said Sonia reluctantly.yooyoo"Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wickedyoothings? You haven't dared to decide even that!"yooyoo"But I can't know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask whatyoocan't be answered? What's the use of such foolish questions? How couldyooit happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judgeyooto decide who is to live and who is not to live?"yooyoo"Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doingyooanything," Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.yooyoo"You'd better say straight out what you want!" Sonia cried in distress.yoo"You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply toyootorture me?"yooyooShe could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked atyooher in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.yooyoo"Of course you're right, Sonia," he said softly at last. He was suddenlyyoochanged. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.yooEven his voice was suddenly weak. "I told you yesterday that I was notyoocoming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I've said is to askyooforgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.yooI was asking forgiveness, Sonia...."yooyooHe tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete inyoohis pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.yooyooAnd suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatredyoofor Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightenedyooof this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but heyoomet her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there wasyoolove in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the realyoofeeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant thatyoo_that_ minute had come.yooyooHe hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly heyooturned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and withoutyoouttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.yooyooHis sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he hadyoostood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that "he mustyoonot lose another minute."yooyoo"What's the matter?" asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.yooyooHe could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way heyoohad intended to "tell" and he did not understand what was happening toyoohim now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him andyoowaited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. Ityoowas unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,yoohelplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passedyoothrough Sonia's heart.yooyoo"What's the matter?" she repeated, drawing a little away from him.yooyoo"Nothing, Sonia, don't be frightened.... It's nonsense. It really isyoononsense, if you think of it," he muttered, like a man in delirium. "Whyyoohave I come to torture you?" he added suddenly, looking at her. "Why,yooreally? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia...."yooyooHe had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an houryoobefore, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said andyoofeeling a continual tremor all over.yooyoo"Oh, how you are suffering!" she muttered in distress, looking intentlyyooat him.yooyoo"It's all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia." He suddenly smiled, a paleyoohelpless smile for two seconds. "You remember what I meant to tell youyooyesterday?"yooyooSonia waited uneasily.yooyoo"I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, butyoothat if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta."yooyooShe began trembling all over.yooyoo"Well, here I've come to tell you."yooyoo"Then you really meant it yesterday?" she whispered with difficulty.yoo"How do you know?" she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining heryooreason.yooyooSonia's face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.yooyoo"I know."yooyooShe paused a minute.yooyoo"Have they found him?" she asked timidly.yooyoo"No."yooyoo"Then how do you know about _it_?" she asked again, hardly audibly andyooagain after a minute's pause.yooyooHe turned to her and looked very intently at her.yooyoo"Guess," he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.yooyooA shudder passed over her.yooyoo"But you... why do you frighten me like this?" she said, smiling like ayoochild.yooyoo"I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know," Raskolnikov wentyooon, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyesyooaway. "He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed heryooaccidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone andyoohe went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too."yooyooAnother awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.yooyoo"You can't guess, then?" he asked suddenly, feeling as though he wereyooflinging himself down from a steeple.yooyoo"N-no..." whispered Sonia.yooyoo"Take a good look."yooyooAs soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze hisyooheart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face theyooface of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta'syooface, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to theyoowall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, lookingyooas little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,yoolooking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back andyooholding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the sameyoothing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the sameyooterror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her leftyoohand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began toyooget up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixedyooeven more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fearyooshowed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almostyoowith the same _childish_ smile.yooyoo"Have you guessed?" he whispered at last.yooyoo"Good God!" broke in an awful wail from her bosom.yooyooShe sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but ayoomoment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his handsyooand, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into hisyooface again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look sheyootried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;yoothere was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, whenyooshe recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why sheyoohad seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, foryooinstance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, asyoosoon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseenyoothis very thing.yooyoo"Stop, Sonia, enough! don't torture me," he begged her miserably.yooyooIt was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,yoobut this is how it happened.yooyooShe jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing heryoohands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and satyoodown again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a suddenyooshe started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell onyooher knees before him, she did not know why.yooyoo"What have you done--what have you done to yourself?" she said inyoodespair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her armsyooround him, and held him tightly.yooyooRaskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.yooyoo"You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell youyooabout that.... You don't think what you are doing."yooyoo"There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!" sheyoocried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke intoyooviolent hysterical weeping.yooyooA feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it atyooonce. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyesyooand hung on his eyelashes.yooyoo"Then you won't leave me, Sonia?" he said, looking at her almost withyoohope.yooyoo"No, no, never, nowhere!" cried Sonia. "I will follow you, I will followyooyou everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn't Iyooknow you before! Why didn't you come before? Oh, dear!"yooyoo"Here I have come."yooyoo"Yes, now! What's to be done now?... Together, together!" she repeatedyooas it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. "I'll follow you toyooSiberia!"yooyooHe recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came toyoohis lips.yooyoo"Perhaps I don't want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia," he said.yooyooSonia looked at him quickly.yooyooAgain after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy manyoothe terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone sheyooseemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. Sheyooknew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now allyoothese questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could notyoobelieve it: "He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?"yooyoo"What's the meaning of it? Where am I?" she said in completeyoobewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. "How could you,yooyou, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What doesyooit mean?"yooyoo"Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia," he answered wearily, almostyoowith vexation.yooyooSonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:yooyoo"You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?"yooyoo"No, Sonia, no," he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. "I wasyoonot so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that'syoonot the real thing either.... Don't torture me, Sonia."yooyooSonia clasped her hands.yooyoo"Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who couldyoobelieve it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yetyoorob and murder! Ah," she cried suddenly, "that money you gave KaterinayooIvanovna... that money.... Can that money..."yooyoo"No, Sonia," he broke in hurriedly, "that money was not it. Don't worryyooyourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, theyooday I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....yooThat money was mine--my own."yooyooSonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.yooyoo"And _that_ money.... I don't even know really whether there was anyyoomoney," he added softly, as though reflecting. "I took a purse off heryooneck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...yoobut I didn't look in it; I suppose I hadn't time.... And theyoothings--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse nextyoomorning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now...."yooyooSonia strained every nerve to listen.yooyoo"Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?" sheyooasked quickly, catching at a straw.yooyoo"I don't know.... I haven't yet decided whether to take that money oryoonot," he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, heyoogave a brief ironical smile. "Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?"yooyooThe thought flashed through Sonia's mind, wasn't he mad? But sheyoodismissed it at once. "No, it was something else." She could makeyoonothing of it, nothing.yooyoo"Do you know, Sonia," he said suddenly with conviction, "let me tellyooyou: if I'd simply killed because I was hungry," laying stress onyooevery word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, "I shouldyoobe _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you," heyoocried a moment later with a sort of despair, "what would it matter toyooyou if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by suchyooa stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I've come to youyooto-day?"yooyooAgain Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.yooyoo"I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left."yooyoo"Go where?" asked Sonia timidly.yooyoo"Not to steal and not to murder, don't be anxious," he smiled bitterly.yoo"We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it's only now, only thisyoomoment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!yooYesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for oneyoothing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won't leave me,yooSonia?"yooyooShe squeezed his hand.yooyoo"And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?" he cried a minuteyoolater in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. "Here you expectyooan explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I seeyoothat. But what can I tell you? You won't understand and will only sufferyoomisery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.yooWhy do you do it? Because I couldn't bear my burden and have come toyoothrow it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And canyooyou love such a mean wretch?"yooyoo"But aren't you suffering, too?" cried Sonia.yooyooAgain a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for anyooinstant softened it.yooyoo"Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a greatyoodeal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn't haveyoocome. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That'syoonot the point. I must speak now, but I don't know how to begin."yooyooHe paused and sank into thought.yooyoo"Ach, we are so different," he cried again, "we are not alike. And why,yoowhy did I come? I shall never forgive myself that."yooyoo"No, no, it was a good thing you came," cried Sonia. "It's better Iyooshould know, far better!"yooyooHe looked at her with anguish.yooyoo"What if it were really that?" he said, as though reaching a conclusion.yoo"Yes, that's what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why Iyookilled her.... Do you understand now?"yooyoo"N-no," Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. "Only speak, speak, I shallyoounderstand, I shall understand _in myself_!" she kept begging him.yooyoo"You'll understand? Very well, we shall see!" He paused and was for someyootime lost in meditation.yooyoo"It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what ifyooNapoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he hadyoonot had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin hisyoocareer with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,yoothere had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who hadyooto be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, youyoounderstand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there hadyoobeen no other means? Wouldn't he have felt a pang at its being so faryoofrom monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that Iyooworried myself fearfully over that 'question' so that I was awfullyyooashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it wouldyoonot have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struckyoohim that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that thereyoowas anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,yoohe would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!yooWell, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, followingyoohis example. And that's exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,yooSonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that's just how ityoowas."yooyooSonia did not think it at all funny.yooyoo"You had better tell me straight out... without examples," she begged,yoostill more timidly and scarcely audibly.yooyooHe turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.yooyoo"You are right again, Sonia. Of course that's all nonsense, it's almostyooall talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcelyyooanything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemnedyooto drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was ayoostudent, but I couldn't keep myself at the university and was forcedyoofor a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in tenyooor twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher oryooclerk with a salary of a thousand roubles" (he repeated it as though ityoowere a lesson) "and by that time my mother would be worn out with griefyooand anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while myyoosister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it's a hardyoothing to pass everything by all one's life, to turn one's back uponyooeverything, to forget one's mother and decorously accept the insultsyooinflicted on one's sister. Why should one? When one has buried them toyooburden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them againyoowithout a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman'syoomoney and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,yooto keep myself at the university and for a little while after leavingyooit--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build upyooa completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....yooWell... that's all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I didyoowrong.... Well, that's enough."yooyooHe struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his headyoosink.yooyoo"Oh, that's not it, that's not it," Sonia cried in distress. "How couldyooone... no, that's not right, not right."yooyoo"You see yourself that it's not right. But I've spoken truly, it's theyootruth."yooyoo"As though that could be the truth! Good God!"yooyoo"I've only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmfulyoocreature."yooyoo"A human being--a louse!"yooyoo"I too know it wasn't a louse," he answered, looking strangely atyooher. "But I am talking nonsense, Sonia," he added. "I've been talkingyoononsense a long time.... That's not it, you are right there. There wereyooquite, quite other causes for it! I haven't talked to anyone for soyoolong, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now."yooyooHis eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; anyoouneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seenyoothrough his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She tooyoowas growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehowyoocomprehensible, but yet... "But how, how! Good God!" And she wrung heryoohands in despair.yooyoo"No, Sonia, that's not it," he began again suddenly, raising his head,yooas though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it wereyooroused him--"that's not it! Better... imagine--yes, it's certainlyyoobetter--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictiveyooand... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let's have it all outyooat once! They've talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you justyoonow I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know thatyooperhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I neededyoofor the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,yoono doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But Iyooturned sulky and wouldn't. (Yes, sulkiness, that's the right word foryooit!) I sat in my room like a spider. You've been in my den, you've seenyooit.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms crampyoothe soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn'tyoogo out of it! I wouldn't on purpose! I didn't go out for days together,yooand I wouldn't work, I wouldn't even eat, I just lay there doingyoonothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn't, Iyoowent all day without; I wouldn't ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! Atyoonight I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn't earn money foryoocandles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust liesyooan inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still andyoothinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strangeyoodreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancyyoothat... No, that's not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I keptyooasking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and Iyooknow they are--yet I won't be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if oneyoowaits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards Iyoounderstood that that would never come to pass, that men won't change andyoothat nobody can alter it and that it's not worth wasting effort over it.yooYes, that's so. That's the law of their nature, Sonia,... that's so!...yooAnd I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit willyoohave power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in theiryooeyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and heyoowho dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till nowyooand so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!"yooyooThough Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer caredyoowhether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; heyoowas in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long withoutyootalking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become hisyoofaith and code.yooyoo"I divined then, Sonia," he went on eagerly, "that power is onlyyoovouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is onlyyooone thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the firstyootime in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had everyoothought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it isyoothat not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring toyoogo straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wantedyoo_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have theyoodaring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!"yooyoo"Oh hush, hush," cried Sonia, clasping her hands. "You turned away fromyooGod and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!"yooyoo"Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this becameyooclear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?"yooyoo"Hush, don't laugh, blasphemer! You don't understand, you don'tyoounderstand! Oh God! He won't understand!"yooyoo"Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devilyooleading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!" he repeated with gloomy insistence. "Iyooknow it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it allyooover to myself, lying there in the dark.... I've argued it all over withyoomyself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, howyoosick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget ityooand make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don'tyoosuppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like ayoowise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn't suppose thatyooI didn't know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whetheryooI had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn't the right--or that ifyooI asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn'tyooso for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to hisyoogoal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,yoowondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearlyyooof course that I wasn't Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of thatyoobattle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murderyoowithout casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn'tyoowant to lie about it even to myself. It wasn't to help my mother I didyoothe murder--that's nonsense--I didn't do the murder to gain wealth andyoopower and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;yooI did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became ayoobenefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men inyoomy web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn't have cared at thatyoomoment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. Ityoowas not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it allyoonow.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murderyooagain. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else ledyoome on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louseyoolike everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers oryoonot, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a tremblingyoocreature or whether I have the _right_..."yooyoo"To kill? Have the right to kill?" Sonia clasped her hands.yooyoo"Ach, Sonia!" he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort,yoobut was contemptuously silent. "Don't interrupt me, Sonia. I want toyooprove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown meyoosince that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just suchyooa louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here I've come to youyoonow! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come toyooyou? Listen: when I went then to the old woman's I only went toyoo_try_.... You may be sure of that!"yooyoo"And you murdered her!"yooyoo"But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go toyoocommit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!yooDid I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myselfyooonce for all, for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that oldyoowoman, not I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!" he cried in ayoosudden spasm of agony, "let me be!"yooyooHe leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands asyooin a vise.yooyoo"What suffering!" A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.yooyoo"Well, what am I to do now?" he asked, suddenly raising his head andyoolooking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.yooyoo"What are you to do?" she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had beenyoofull of tears suddenly began to shine. "Stand up!" (She seized him byyoothe shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.) "Go at once,yoothis very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss theyooearth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and sayyooto all men aloud, 'I am a murderer!' Then God will send you life again.yooWill you go, will you go?" she asked him, trembling all over, snatchingyoohis two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyesyoofull of fire.yooyooHe was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.yooyoo"You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?" he asked gloomily.yooyoo"Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that's what you must do."yooyoo"No! I am not going to them, Sonia!"yooyoo"But how will you go on living? What will you live for?" cried Sonia,yoo"how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk to your mother? (Oh, whatyoowill become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned youryoomother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh,yooGod!" she cried, "why, he knows it all himself. How, how can he live byyoohimself! What will become of you now?"yooyoo"Don't be a child, Sonia," he said softly. "What wrong have I doneyoothem? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That's only ayoophantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as ayoovirtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them.yooAnd what should I say to them--that I murdered her, but did not dare toyootake the money and hid it under a stone?" he added with a bitter smile.yoo"Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not gettingyooit. A coward and a fool! They wouldn't understand and they don't deserveyooto understand. Why should I go to them? I won't. Don't be a child,yooSonia...."yooyoo"It will be too much for you to bear, too much!" she repeated, holdingyooout her hands in despairing supplication.yooyoo"Perhaps I've been unfair to myself," he observed gloomily, pondering,yoo"perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I've been in too greatyooa hurry to condemn myself. I'll make another fight for it."yooyooA haughty smile appeared on his lips.yooyoo"What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole life!"yooyoo"I shall get used to it," he said grimly and thoughtfully. "Listen," heyoobegan a minute later, "stop crying, it's time to talk of the facts: I'veyoocome to tell you that the police are after me, on my track...."yooyoo"Ach!" Sonia cried in terror.yooyoo"Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you areyoofrightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shallyoomake a struggle for it and they won't do anything to me. They've no realyooevidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; butyooto-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explainedyootwo ways, that's to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, doyooyou understand? And I shall, for I've learnt my lesson. But they willyoocertainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened,yoothey would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they willyooarrest me to-day.... But that's no matter, Sonia; they'll let me outyooagain... for there isn't any real proof against me, and there won't be,yooI give you my word for it. And they can't convict a man on what theyyoohave against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I willyootry to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that theyyoowon't be frightened.... My sister's future is secure, however, now, Iyoobelieve... and my mother's must be too.... Well, that's all. Be careful,yoothough. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?"yooyoo"Oh, I will, I will."yooyooThey sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they hadyoobeen cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked atyooSonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say heyoofelt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was ayoostrange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt thatyooall his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least partyooof his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, heyoosuddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.yooyoo"Sonia," he said, "you'd better not come and see me when I am inyooprison."yooyooSonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.yooyoo"Have you a cross on you?" she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.yooyooHe did not at first understand the question.yooyoo"No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I haveyooanother, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed withyooLizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I willyoowear Lizaveta's now and give you this. Take it... it's mine! It's mine,yooyou know," she begged him. "We will go to suffer together, and togetheryoowe will bear our cross!"yooyoo"Give it me," said Raskolnikov.yooyooHe did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back theyoohand he held out for the cross.yooyoo"Not now, Sonia. Better later," he added to comfort her.yooyoo"Yes, yes, better," she repeated with conviction, "when you go to meetyooyour suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I'll put it on you,yoowe will pray and go together."yooyooAt that moment someone knocked three times at the door.yooyoo"Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?" they heard in a very familiar andyoopolite voice.yooyooSonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.yooLebeziatnikov appeared at the door.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VyooyooLebeziatnikov looked perturbed.yooyoo"I've come to you, Sofya Semyonovna," he began. "Excuse me... I thoughtyooI should find you," he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, "that is,yooI didn't mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... KaterinayooIvanovna has gone out of her mind," he blurted out suddenly, turningyoofrom Raskolnikov to Sonia.yooyooSonia screamed.yooyoo"At least it seems so. But... we don't know what to do, you see! Sheyoocame back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhapsyoobeaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father's formeryoochief, she didn't find him at home: he was dining at some otheryoogeneral's.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general's,yooand, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief toyoosee her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine whatyoohappened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her ownyoostory, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believeyooit.... How it is she wasn't taken up, I can't understand! Now she isyootelling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it's difficult toyoounderstand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,yooshe shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take theyoochildren and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the childrenyoowill sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go everyyooday under the general's window... 'to let everyone see well-bornyoochildren, whose father was an official, begging in the street.' Sheyookeeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lidayooto sing 'My Village,' the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearingyooup all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she meansyooto carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won'tyoolisten to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It's beyondyooanything!"yooyooLebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almostyoobreathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,yooputting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her andyooLebeziatnikov came after him.yooyoo"She has certainly gone mad!" he said to Raskolnikov, as they went outyoointo the street. "I didn't want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I saidyoo'it seemed like it,' but there isn't a doubt of it. They say that inyooconsumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it's a pity Iyooknow nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn'tyoolisten."yooyoo"Did you talk to her about the tubercles?"yooyoo"Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn't have understood!yooBut what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that heyoohas nothing to cry about, he'll stop crying. That's clear. Is it youryooconviction that he won't?"yooyoo"Life would be too easy if it were so," answered Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult foryooKaterina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they haveyoobeen conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing theyooinsane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientificyooman of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of suchyootreatment. His idea was that there's nothing really wrong with theyoophysical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, ayoological mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. Heyoogradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, theyyoosay he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how faryoosuccess was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems atyooleast."yooyooRaskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where heyoolived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikovyoowoke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.yooyooRaskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middleyooof it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tatteredyoopaper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuousyooknocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, roseyooon tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air ofyooabsorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who wasyoohammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on theyoowindow-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung outyooof the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat downyooon the sofa.yooyooNever, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!yooyooYes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, nowyoothat he had made her more miserable.yooyoo"Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poisonyooher life? Oh, the meanness of it!"yooyoo"I will remain alone," he said resolutely, "and she shall not come toyoothe prison!"yooyooFive minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was ayoostrange thought.yooyoo"Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia," he thought suddenly.yooyooHe could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surgingyoothrough his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. Atyoofirst she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as heyoohad done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same placeyooas yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almostyoovacantly at her.yooyoo"Don't be angry, brother; I've only come for one minute," said Dounia.yooyooHer face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.yooHe saw that she too had come to him with love.yooyoo"Brother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained andyootold me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through ayoostupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me thatyoothere is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with suchyoohorror. I don't think so, and I fully understand how indignant you mustyoobe, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That'syoowhat I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don'tyoojudge you, I don't venture to judge you, and forgive me for havingyooblamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,yooshould keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,yoobut I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you thatyooyou will come very soon. Don't worry about her; _I_ will set her mind atyoorest; but don't you try her too much--come once at least; remember thatyooshe is your mother. And now I have come simply to say" (Dounia beganyooto get up) "that if you should need me or should need... all my life oryooanything... call me, and I'll come. Good-bye!"yooyooShe turned abruptly and went towards the door.yooyoo"Dounia!" Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. "That Razumihin,yooDmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow."yooyooDounia flushed slightly.yooyoo"Well?" she asked, waiting a moment.yooyoo"He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....yooGood-bye, Dounia."yooyooDounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.yooyoo"But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever thatyooyou... give me such a parting message?"yooyoo"Never mind.... Good-bye."yooyooHe turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked atyoohim uneasily, and went out troubled.yooyooNo, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)yoowhen he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,yooand even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.yooyoo"Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, andyoowill feel that I stole her kiss."yooyoo"And would _she_ stand that test?" he went on a few minutes later toyoohimself. "No, she wouldn't; girls like that can't stand things! Theyyoonever do."yooyooAnd he thought of Sonia.yooyooThere was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight wasyoofading. He took up his cap and went out.yooyooHe could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But allyoothis continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. Andyooif he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because thisyoocontinual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possessionyooof his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.yooyooHe wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery hadyoobegun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acuteyooabout it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;yooit brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, ayooforetaste of an eternity "on a square yard of space." Towards eveningyoothis sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.yooyoo"With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset oryoosomething, one can't help doing something stupid! You'll go to Dounia,yooas well as to Sonia," he muttered bitterly.yooyooHe heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up toyoohim.yooyoo"Only fancy, I've been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, she'syoocarried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna andyooI have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and makingyoothe children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at theyoocross-roads and in front of shops; there's a crowd of fools runningyooafter them. Come along!"yooyoo"And Sonia?" Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.yooyoo"Simply frantic. That is, it's not Sofya Semyonovna's frantic, butyooKaterina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova's frantic too. But KaterinayooIvanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. They'll beyootaken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....yooThey are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from SofyayooSemyonovna's, quite close."yooyooOn the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the oneyoowhere Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principallyyooof gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna couldyoobe heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacleyoolikely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dressyoowith the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous wayyooon one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Heryoowasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed outyooof doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.yooBut her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grewyoomore intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxedyoothem, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, beganyooexplaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation byyootheir not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at theyoocrowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, sheyooimmediately appealed to him to see what these children "from a genteel,yooone may say aristocratic, house" had been brought to. If she heardyoolaughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffersyooand begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook theiryooheads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with theyoofrightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spokenyoowas not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead ofyoorapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,yoowhen she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined inyoothe singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,yoowhich made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her mostyoofurious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort hadyoobeen made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. Theyooboy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.yooThere had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,yooor rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated withyooa broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been KaterinayooIvanovna's grandmother's and had been preserved as a family possession.yooPolenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at heryoomother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised heryoomother's condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terriblyyoofrightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed KaterinayooIvanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but KaterinayooIvanovna was not to be persuaded.yooyoo"Leave off, Sonia, leave off," she shouted, speaking fast, panting andyoocoughing. "You don't know what you ask; you are like a child! I'veyootold you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Letyooeveryone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,yoothough their father was an honourable man who served all his life inyootruth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service." (KaterinayooIvanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughlyyoobelieved it.) "Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,yooSonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, Iyoowon't go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?" she cried, seeingyooRaskolnikov and rushing up to him. "Explain to this silly girl, please,yoothat nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn theiryooliving, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we areyooan honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that generalyoowill lose his post, you'll see! We shall perform under his windows everyyooday, and if the Tsar drives by, I'll fall on my knees, put the childrenyoobefore me, show them to him, and say 'Defend us father.' He is theyoofather of the fatherless, he is merciful, he'll protect us, you'llyoosee, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,yooyou'll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! Whatyooare you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, RodionyooRomanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What's one to do withyoosuch children?"yooyooAnd she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,yoorapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov triedyooto persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,yoothat it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets likeyooan organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of ayooboarding-school.yooyoo"A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air," cried KaterinayooIvanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. "No, Rodion Romanovitch, thatyoodream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,yooRodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standingyooin the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote myyooname, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!yooBut enough of them, now I'll provide for the children myself, I won'tyoobow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us!" she pointedyooto Sonia. "Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, only twoyoofarthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run afteryoous, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughingyooat?" (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) "It's all because Kolya hereyoois so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?yooTell me in French, _parlez-moi français_. Why, I've taught you, you knowyoosome phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, wellyoobrought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We aren'tyoogoing to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteelyoosong.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,yoobut we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to findyoosomething to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,yooas you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk ityooover and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,yoowhere there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticedyooat once. Lida knows 'My Village' only, nothing but 'My Village,' andyooeveryone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,yoohave you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you'd help your mother!yooMy memory's quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We reallyyoocan't sing 'An Hussar.' Ah, let us sing in French, 'Cinq sous,' I haveyootaught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people willyoosee at once that you are children of good family, and that will be muchyoomore touching.... You might sing 'Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre,'yoofor that's quite a child's song and is sung as a lullaby in all theyooaristocratic houses.yooyoo"_Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_..."yooshe began singing. "But no, better sing 'Cinq sous.' Now, Kolya, youryoohands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the otheryooway, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!yooyoo"_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_."yooyoo(Cough-cough-cough!) "Set your dress straight, Polenka, it's slippedyoodown on your shoulders," she observed, panting from coughing. "Now it'syooparticularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all mayyoosee that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodiceyooshould be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,yoowith your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quiteyoodeformed by it.... Why, you're all crying again! What's the matter,yoostupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what anyoounbearable child!yooyoo"Cinq sous, cinq sous.yooyoo"A policeman again! What do you want?"yooyooA policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at thatyoomoment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-lookingyooofficial of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delightedyooKaterina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached andyoowithout a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face woreyooa look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him ayoopolite, even ceremonious, bow.yooyoo"I thank you, honoured sir," she began loftily. "The causes that haveyooinduced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous andyoohonourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).yooYou see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say ofyooaristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eatingyoogrouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. 'Your excellency,' I said,yoo'protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,yooand on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered hisyooonly daughter.'... That policeman again! Protect me," she cried to theyooofficial. "Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just runyooaway from one of them. What do you want, fool?"yooyoo"It's forbidden in the streets. You mustn't make a disturbance."yooyoo"It's you're making a disturbance. It's just the same as if I wereyoogrinding an organ. What business is it of yours?"yooyoo"You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven't got one, and inyoothat way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?"yooyoo"What, a license?" wailed Katerina Ivanovna. "I buried my husbandyooto-day. What need of a license?"yooyoo"Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself," began the official. "Come along;yooI will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd. You areyooill."yooyoo"Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don't know," screamed KaterinayooIvanovna. "We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! Where is she?yooShe is crying too! What's the matter with you all? Kolya, Lida, whereyooare you going?" she cried suddenly in alarm. "Oh, silly children! Kolya,yooLida, where are they off to?..."yooyooKolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and theiryoomother's mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran offyooat the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.yooWeeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She wasyooa piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting foryoobreath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.yooyoo"Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungratefulyoochildren!... Polenka! catch them.... It's for your sakes I..."yooyooShe stumbled as she ran and fell down.yooyoo"She's cut herself, she's bleeding! Oh, dear!" cried Sonia, bending overyooher.yooyooAll ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were theyoofirst at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him theyoopoliceman who muttered, "Bother!" with a gesture of impatience, feelingyoothat the job was going to be a troublesome one.yooyoo"Pass on! Pass on!" he said to the crowd that pressed forward.yooyoo"She's dying," someone shouted.yooyoo"She's gone out of her mind," said another.yooyoo"Lord have mercy upon us," said a woman, crossing herself. "Have theyyoocaught the little girl and the boy? They're being brought back, theyooelder one's got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!"yooyooWhen they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she hadyoonot cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the bloodyoothat stained the pavement red was from her chest.yooyoo"I've seen that before," muttered the official to Raskolnikov andyooLebeziatnikov; "that's consumption; the blood flows and chokes theyoopatient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...yoonearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What's to be done though?yooShe is dying."yooyoo"This way, this way, to my room!" Sonia implored. "I live here!... See,yoothat house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste," she turnedyoofrom one to the other. "Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!"yooyooThanks to the official's efforts, this plan was adopted, the policemanyooeven helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia'syooroom, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was stillyooflowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,yooLebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and wereyoofollowed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followedyooto the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, whoyoowere trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from theyooKapernaumovs' room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strangeyooappearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, hisyoowife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and severalyooopen-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,yooSvidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at himyoowith surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not havingyoonoticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. Theyooofficial whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late nowyoofor the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ranyoohimself.yooyooMeanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceasedyoofor a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes atyooSonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow withyooa handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on theyoobed, supporting her on both sides.yooyoo"Where are the children?" she said in a faint voice. "You've broughtyoothem, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!"yooyooOnce more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,yoolooking about her.yooyoo"So that's how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room."yooyooShe looked at her with a face of suffering.yooyoo"We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well,yoohere they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I've hadyooenough! The ball is over." (Cough!) "Lay me down, let me die in peace."yooyooThey laid her back on the pillow.yooyoo"What, the priest? I don't want him. You haven't got a rouble to spare.yooI have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I haveyoosuffered.... And if He won't forgive me, I don't care!"yooyooShe sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,yooturned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,yoobut at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse andyoodifficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.yooyoo"I said to him, your excellency," she ejaculated, gasping after eachyooword. "That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,yoomake haste! _Glissez, glissez! pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels, be ayoograceful child!yooyoo"_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_yooyoo"What next? That's the thing to sing.yooyoo"_Du hast die schonsten Augen Madchen, was willst du mehr?_yooyoo"What an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah,yooyes!yooyoo"In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.yooyoo"Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Youryoofather, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh thoseyoodays! Oh that's the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I'veyooforgotten. Remind me! How was it?"yooyooShe was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horriblyyoohoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,yoowith a look of growing terror.yooyoo"In the heat of midday!... in the vale!... of Dagestan!... With lead inyoomy breast!..."yooyoo"Your excellency!" she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream andyooa flood of tears, "protect the orphans! You have been their father'syooguest... one may say aristocratic...." She started, regainingyooconsciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at onceyoorecognised Sonia.yooyoo"Sonia, Sonia!" she articulated softly and caressingly, as thoughyoosurprised to find her there. "Sonia darling, are you here, too?"yooyooThey lifted her up again.yooyoo"Enough! It's over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!"yooshe cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on theyoopillow.yooyooShe sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.yooHer pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her legyoomoved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.yooyooSonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionlessyoowith her head pressed to the dead woman's wasted bosom. Polenka threwyooherself at her mother's feet, kissing them and weeping violently. ThoughyooKolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feelingyoothat it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other'syoolittle shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once openedyootheir mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancyyoodress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.yooyooAnd how did "the certificate of merit" come to be on the bed besideyooKaterina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.yooyooHe walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.yooyoo"She is dead," he said.yooyoo"Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you," said Svidrigaïlov,yoocoming up to them.yooyooLebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.yooSvidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.yooyoo"I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. You knowyooit's a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. Iyoowill put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum,yooand I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on comingyooof age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And Iyoowill pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn't she? Soyootell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand."yooyoo"What is your motive for such benevolence?" asked Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Ah! you sceptical person!" laughed Svidrigaïlov. "I told you I had noyooneed of that money. Won't you admit that it's simply done from humanity?yooShe wasn't 'a louse,' you know" (he pointed to the corner where theyoodead woman lay), "was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you'llyooagree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she toyoodie? And if I didn't help them, Polenka would go the same way."yooyooHe said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping hisyooeyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his ownyoophrases, spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly atyooSvidrigaïlov.yooyoo"How do you know?" he whispered, hardly able to breathe.yooyoo"Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich's, the other side of the wall.yooHere is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devotedyoofriend of mine. I am a neighbour."yooyoo"You?"yooyoo"Yes," continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. "I assure youyooon my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested meyooenormously. I told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well,yoohere we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am. You'llyoosee that you can get on with me!"yooyooyooyooyooPART VIyooyooyooyooCHAPTER IyooyooA strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog hadyoofallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which thereyoowas no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that hisyoomind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, withyoointervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had beenyoomistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the dateyooof certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece hisyoorecollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from whatyooother people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explainedyooevents as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. Atyootimes he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimesyooto panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,yooof complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previousyooterror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimesyooseen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escapeyoofrom a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essentialyoofacts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksomeyooto him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, theyooneglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitableyooruin.yooyooHe was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to beyoopermanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From the time of Svidrigaïlov'syootoo menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia's room at the moment ofyooKaterina Ivanovna's death, the normal working of his mind seemed toyoobreak down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,yooRaskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, findingyoohimself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretchedyooeating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he hadyoocome there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognisedyoosuddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to anyoounderstanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walkingyoooutside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they hadyoofixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Anotheryootime he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushesyooand could not at first understand how he had come there.yooyooBut during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna's death, heyoohad two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia's lodging, where heyoohad gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made noyooreference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed notyooto speak of it for a time.yooyooKaterina Ivanovna's body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov wasyoobusy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. Atyootheir last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had madeyooan arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna'syoochildren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in gettingyoohold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be atyooonce placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settledyooon them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to placeyooorphans with some property than destitute ones. He said somethingyootoo about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to seeyooRaskolnikov, mentioning that "he would like to consult with him, thatyoothere were things they must talk over...."yooyooThis conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigaïlovyoolooked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,yoodropping his voice, asked: "But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; youyoodon't seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don't seem toyoounderstand. Cheer up! We'll talk things over; I am only sorry, I'veyooso much to do of my own business and other people's. Ah, RodionyooRomanovitch," he added suddenly, "what all men need is fresh air, freshyooair... more than anything!"yooyooHe moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, whoyoowere coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. ByyooSvidrigaïlov's orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlovyoowent his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followedyoothe priest into Sonia's room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,yooslowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood theyoothought of death and the presence of death had something oppressiveyooand mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiemyooservice. And there was something else here as well, too awful andyoodisturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by theyoocoffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as ityoowere, timidly weeping.yooyoo"These last two days she hasn't said a word to me, she hasn't glanced atyoome," Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;yoothe incense rose in clouds; the priest read, "Give rest, oh Lord...."yooRaskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them andyootook his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,yooRaskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let heryoohead sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewilderedyooRaskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace ofyoorepugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was theyoofurthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.yooyooSonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He feltyoovery miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, heyoowould have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole lifeyoothere. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he hadyoonever been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on toyoothe high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelieryoothe place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence nearyoohim. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that heyoomade haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enteryoorestaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he feltyooeasier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an houryoolistening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positivelyyooenjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,yooas though his conscience smote him. "Here I sit listening to singing,yoois that what I ought to be doing?" he thought. Yet he felt at onceyoothat that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was somethingyoorequiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearlyyoounderstand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. "No, better theyoostruggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better someyoochallenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!" he thought. He went out ofyoothe tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia andyoohis mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he wokeyooup before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, tremblingyooall over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when heyooarrived. After some hours' sleep the fever left him, but he woke upyoolate, two o'clock in the afternoon.yooyooHe remembered that Katerina Ivanovna's funeral had been fixed for thatyooday, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought himyoosome food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. Hisyoohead was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last threeyoodays. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.yooyooThe door opened and Razumihin came in.yooyoo"Ah, he's eating, then he's not ill," said Razumihin. He took a chairyooand sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.yooyooHe was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evidentyooannoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as thoughyoohe had some special fixed determination.yooyoo"Listen," he began resolutely. "As far as I am concerned, you may all goyooto hell, but from what I see, it's clear to me that I can't make head oryootail of it; please don't think I've come to ask you questions. I don'tyoowant to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare sayyooI shouldn't stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only comeyooto find out once for all whether it's a fact that you are mad? There isyooa conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admityooI've been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,yoorepulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavioryooto your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat themyooas you have; so you must be mad."yooyoo"When did you see them last?"yooyoo"Just now. Haven't you seen them since then? What have you been doingyoowith yourself? Tell me, please. I've been to you three times already.yooYour mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made upyooher mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; sheyoowouldn't hear a word. 'If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who canyoolook after him like his mother?' she said. We all came here together, weyoocouldn't let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.yooWe came in, you weren't here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,yoowhile we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: 'If he'syoogone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it'syoohumiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging foryookindness.' She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.yoo'I see,' she said, 'that he has time for _his girl_.' She means by _youryoogirl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don't know. Iyoowent at once to Sofya Semyonovna's, for I wanted to know what was goingyooon. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, andyooSofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. Iyooapologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So that's allyoononsense and you haven't got a girl; the most likely thing is that youyooare mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you'd not hadyooa bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, butyoothough you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That I'dyooswear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,yoofor there's some mystery, some secret about it, and I don't intend toyooworry my brains over your secrets. So I've simply come to swear at you,"yoohe finished, getting up, "to relieve my mind. And I know what to doyoonow."yooyoo"What do you mean to do now?"yooyoo"What business is it of yours what I mean to do?"yooyoo"You are going in for a drinking bout."yooyoo"How... how did you know?"yooyoo"Why, it's pretty plain."yooyooRazumihin paused for a minute.yooyoo"You always have been a very rational person and you've never been mad,yoonever," he observed suddenly with warmth. "You're right: I shall drink.yooGood-bye!"yooyooAnd he moved to go out.yooyoo"I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think ityoowas--about you, Razumihin."yooyoo"About me! But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?"yooRazumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.yooyooOne could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.yooyoo"She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me."yooyoo"She did!"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"What did you say to her... I mean, about me?"yooyoo"I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man. I didn'tyootell her you love her, because she knows that herself."yooyoo"She knows that herself?"yooyoo"Well, it's pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,yooyou would remain to look after them. I, so to speak, give them into youryookeeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you loveyooher, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she tooyoomay love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself,yooas you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not."yooyoo"Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go?yooOf course, if it's all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall findyooout the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsenseyooand that you've made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, ayoocapital fellow!..."yooyoo"That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that wasyooa very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it toyootime, don't worry about it. You'll know it all in time when it must be.yooYesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, freshyooair, fresh air. I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meantyooby that."yooyooRazumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silentyooconclusion.yooyoo"He's a political conspirator! He must be. And he's on the eve of someyoodesperate step, that's certain. It can only be that! And... and Douniayooknows," he thought suddenly.yooyoo"So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you," he said, weighing eachyoosyllable, "and you're going to see a man who says we need more air, andyooso of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,"yoohe concluded to himself.yooyoo"What letter?"yooyoo"She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Tooyoomuch so. I began speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then... thenyooshe said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she beganyoowarmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and lockedyooherself in."yooyoo"She got a letter?" Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.yooyoo"Yes, and you didn't know? hm..."yooyooThey were both silent.yooyoo"Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,yoogood-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be offyootoo. I am not going to drink. There's no need now.... That's all stuff!"yooyooHe hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, heyoosuddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:yooyoo"Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry's, thatyooold woman? Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessedyooand given the proofs. It's one of those very workmen, the painter, onlyyoofancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it, allyoothat scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairsyoowhile the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up onyoopurpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of theyooyoung dog! One can hardly credit it; but it's his own explanation, heyoohas confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well, he's simplyyooa genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions ofyoothe lawyers--so there's nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of courseyoopeople like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldn't keepyooup the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. Butyoowhat a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!"yooyoo"Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interestyooyou so?" Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.yooyoo"What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it fromyooPorfiry, among others... It was from him I heard almost all about it."yooyoo"From Porfiry?"yooyoo"From Porfiry."yooyoo"What... what did he say?" Raskolnikov asked in dismay.yooyoo"He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after hisyoofashion."yooyoo"He explained it? Explained it himself?"yooyoo"Yes, yes; good-bye. I'll tell you all about it another time, but nowyooI'm busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, anotheryootime!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunkyoowithout wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I'm going. I'll come againyoovery soon."yooyooHe went out.yooyoo"He's a political conspirator, there's not a doubt about it," Razumihinyoodecided, as he slowly descended the stairs. "And he's drawn his sisteryooin; that's quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna's character.yooThere are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many ofyooher words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all thisyootangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,yoowhat I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It wasyoohis doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude,yoonasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... Andyoohow clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions...yoobefore this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....yooBut what's the meaning now of that letter? There's something in that,yootoo, perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!"yooyooHe thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,yooand he suddenly broke into a run.yooyooAs soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,yoowalked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting theyoosmallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so toyoospeak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.yooyoo"Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, tooyoocramping, the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come uponyoohim at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry's heyoohad been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay'syooconfession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; hisyoobehaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything heyoocould have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly andyoofundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreedyooin his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on hisyoomind!yooyoo"And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle... He worried him, that was true, butyoosomehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to comeyoowith Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; butyooPorfiry was a different matter.yooyoo"And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained ityoo_psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!yooPorfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe thatyooNikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay'syooappearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have onlyyoo_one_ explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalledyoopassages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mindyoorest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, theyyoohad exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and hadyooreached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at theyoofirst word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.yooyoo"And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in theyoocorridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed toyooPorfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?yooWhat had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He mustyoohave some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It was true thatyooa long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sightyoonor sound of Porfiry. Well, that was a bad sign...."yooyooRaskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. Ityoowas the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind,yooat least. "I must settle Svidrigaïlov," he thought, "and as soon asyoopossible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my ownyooaccord." And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in hisyooweary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry oryooSvidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing ityoolater, if not now.yooyoo"We shall see, we shall see," he repeated to himself.yooyooBut no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiryyoohimself in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov wasyoodumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, heyoowas not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid ofyoohim. He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.yoo"Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approachedyooso quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing? Could he have beenyoolistening at the door?"yooyoo"You didn't expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch," Porfiry explained,yoolaughing. "I've been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing byyooand thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I won'tyookeep you long. Just let me have one cigarette."yooyoo"Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down." Raskolnikov gave his visitoryooa seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would haveyoomarvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.yooyooThe last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a manyoowill sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,yooyet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.yooyooRaskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at himyoowithout flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting ayoocigarette.yooyoo"Speak, speak," seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov'syooheart. "Come, why don't you speak?"yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIyooyoo"Ah these cigarettes!" Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, havingyoolighted one. "They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet Iyoocan't give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat andyooa difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately toyooDr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. Heyoopositively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: 'Tobacco's bad foryooyou,' he said, 'your lungs are affected.' But how am I to give it up?yooWhat is there to take its place? I don't drink, that's the mischief,yoohe-he-he, that I don't. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,yooeverything is relative!"yooyoo"Why, he's playing his professional tricks again," Raskolnikov thoughtyoowith disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenlyyoocame back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come uponyoohim then.yooyoo"I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn'tyooknow?" Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. "I came intoyoothis very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thoughtyooI'd return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I lookedyooround, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.yooDon't you lock your door?"yooyooRaskolnikov's face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guessyoohis state of mind.yooyoo"I've come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!yooI owe you an explanation and must give it to you," he continued with ayooslight smile, just patting Raskolnikov's knee.yooyooBut almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into hisyooface; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He hadyoonever seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.yooyoo"A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.yooOur first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thingyooafter another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;yooI feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged andyooyour knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviouryoowas unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all,yooin any case, gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what weyoocame to?... and it was quite indecorous."yooyoo"What is he up to, what does he take me for?" Raskolnikov asked himselfyooin amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.yooyoo"I've decided openness is better between us," Porfiry Petrovitch wentyooon, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling toyoodisconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.yoo"Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolayyooput a stop to it, or I don't know what we might not have come to. Thatyoodamned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realiseyoothat? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to youyooafterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent foryooanyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn't? Whatyooshall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcelyyoosent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).yooAn idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,yooRodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip foryooa time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan't lose what I want,yooanyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;yooit's out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,yoowhich I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I didyooreflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up andyooblurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make ayooman lose all patience, though even then it's rare. I was capable ofyoorealising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little factyooto go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, notyoomerely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to getyoosomething substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprisingyooresults indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,yooon your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at thatyootime."yooyoo"But what are you driving at now?" Raskolnikov muttered at last, askingyoothe question without thinking.yooyoo"What is he talking about?" he wondered distractedly, "does he reallyyootake me to be innocent?"yooyoo"What am I driving at? I've come to explain myself, I consider it myyooduty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,yoothe whole misunderstanding arose. I've caused you a great deal ofyoosuffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand whatyooit must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,yooimperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!yooI regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not withoutyooelements of magnanimity, though I don't agree with all your convictions.yooI wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for aboveyooall I don't want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I feltyooattracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have ayooright to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you've noyooreason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to doyooall I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heartyooand conscience. I speak sincerely."yooyooPorfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush ofyoorenewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocentyoobegan to make him uneasy.yooyoo"It's scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail," PorfiryyooPetrovitch went on. "Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it. To begin withyoothere were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came toyoome... and how they affected you, I need not go into. My suspicionsyoowere aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not haveyoohappened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into thatyooeither. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. Iyooadmit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I wasyoothe first to pitch on you. The old woman's notes on the pledges andyoothe rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.yooI happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man whoyoodescribed it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with greatyoovividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, myyoodear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From ayoohundred rabbits you can't make a horse, a hundred suspicions don't makeyooa proof, as the English proverb says, but that's only from the rationalyoopoint of view--you can't help being partial, for after all a lawyeryoois only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do youyooremember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at theyootime, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,yooyou are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnestyooand... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have feltyoothe same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceivedyooon sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressedyooenthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people isyoodangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literaryyooamateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat ofyooyouth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Youryooarticle is absurd and fantastic, but there's a transparent sincerity,yooa youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. It's ayoogloomy article, but that's what's fine in it. I read your article andyooput it aside, thinking as I did so 'that man won't go the common way.'yooWell, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help beingyoocarried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, Iyooam not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What isyoothere in it? I reflected. There's nothing in it, that is really nothingyooand perhaps absolutely nothing. And it's not at all the thing foryoothe prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I haveyooNikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think whatyooyou like of it, but it's evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; oneyoohas to consider him, too, for it's a matter of life and death. Why amyooI explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame myyoomalicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assureyooyou, he-he! Do you suppose I didn't come to search your room at theyootime? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed,yoonot officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room wasyoosearched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! Iyoothought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself andyooquickly, too; if he's guilty, he's sure to come. Another man wouldn't,yoobut he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing theyoosubject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spreadyoorumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not ayooman to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck byyooyour anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurantyoo'I killed her.' It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, ifyoohe is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thoughtyooat the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov overyooand... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychologyyoocan be taken two ways! Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, youyoocame! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!yooyoo"Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as you came in, do youyooremember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn't expected youyooso specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. Youyoosee what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, thatyoostone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhereyooin a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov andyooafterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began pickingyooyour article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every wordyooof yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.yooyoo"So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, andyooknocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself whatyooI was about. After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense ifyooyou like, and it's more natural so, indeed. I couldn't help admittingyooit was more natural. I was bothered! 'No, I'd better get hold of someyoolittle fact' I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held myyoobreath and was all in a tremor. 'Here is my little fact,' thought I, andyooI didn't think it over, I simply wouldn't. I would have given a thousandyooroubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when youyoowalked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called youyoomurderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a questionyooall the way. And then what about your trembling, what about youryoobell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?yooyoo"And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks onyooyou? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed toyoohave sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do youyooremember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was ayoothunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn't believeyooin the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;yooand how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began makingyoovery, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprisedyooat him myself, even then I didn't believe his story! You see what it isyooto be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _Morgenfrüh_. What has Nikolayyoogot to do with it!"yooyoo"Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and hadyooyourself assured him of it...."yooyooHis voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening inyooindescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and throughyoohim, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did notyoobelieve it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking foryoosomething more definite and conclusive.yooyoo"Mr. Razumihin!" cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a questionyoofrom Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. "He-he-he! But I had toyooput Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin isyoonot the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to meyoowith a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To returnyooto Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how Iyoounderstand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and notyooexactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, don't laughyooat my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. Heyoohas a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tellsyoostories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.yooHe attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a fingeryooto him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but atyootimes, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,yoowithout knowing it himself, for 'How can it be stealing, if one picks ityooup?' And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? Thereyoohave been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in hisyoovillage under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt allyoothis from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And what's more, heyoowanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed atyoonight, read the old books, 'the true' ones, and read himself crazy.yooyoo     [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.yooyoo"Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and theyoowine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. Iyoolearnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and seeyoohim, and now this business came upon him.yooyoo"Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How canyooone get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? Theyoovery word 'trial' frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shallyoosee what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, inyooprison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,yoomade its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force ofyoothe word 'suffering' among some of these people! It's not a question ofyoosuffering for someone's benefit, but simply, 'one must suffer.' If theyyoosuffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my timeyoothere was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prisonyooalways reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himselfyoocrazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, heyooseized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done himyoono harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one sideyooon purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens toyooa prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So 'he took hisyoosuffering.'yooyoo"So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or somethingyooof the sort. I know it for certain from facts, indeed. Only he doesn'tyooknow that I know. What, you don't admit that there are such fantasticyoopeople among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begunyooinfluencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he'llyoocome and tell me all himself. You think he'll hold out? Wait a bit,yoohe'll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him toyoocome and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and amyoostudying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered meyoovery plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidenceyooand prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea,yooknows nothing and doesn't even suspect that he doesn't know!yooyoo"No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn't come in! This is a fantastic,yoogloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heartyooof man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood 'renews,' whenyoocomfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, ayooheart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage,yoobut resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping overyooa precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to theyoocrime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people foryooa theory. He committed the murder and couldn't take the money, and whatyoohe did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn't enough foryoohim to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door andyoorung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, toyoorecall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....yooWell, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he isyooa murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,yooposes as injured innocence. No, that's not the work of a Nikolay, myyoodear Rodion Romanovitch!"yooyooAll that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation thatyoothese words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though heyoohad been stabbed.yooyoo"Then... who then... is the murderer?" he asked in a breathless voice,yoounable to restrain himself.yooyooPorfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed atyoothe question.yooyoo"Who is the murderer?" he repeated, as though unable to believe hisyooears. "Why, _you_, Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer," he added,yooalmost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.yooyooRaskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat downyooagain without uttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.yooyoo"Your lip is twitching just as it did before," Porfiry Petrovitchyooobserved almost sympathetically. "You've been misunderstanding me, Iyoothink, Rodion Romanovitch," he added after a brief pause, "that's whyyooyou are so surprised. I came on purpose to tell you everything and dealyooopenly with you."yooyoo"It was not I murdered her," Raskolnikov whispered like a frightenedyoochild caught in the act.yooyoo"No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else," Porfiryyoowhispered sternly, with conviction.yooyooThey were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about tenyoominutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingersyoothrough his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. SuddenlyyooRaskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.yooyoo"You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old methodyooagain. I wonder you don't get sick of it!"yooyoo"Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a differentyoomatter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone. Youyoosee yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.yooWhether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I amyooconvinced without it."yooyoo"If so, what did you come for?" Raskolnikov asked irritably. "I ask youyoothe same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don't you takeyoome to prison?"yooyoo"Oh, that's your question! I will answer you, point for point. In theyoofirst place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest."yooyoo"How so? If you are convinced you ought...."yooyoo"Ach, what if I am convinced? That's only my dream for the time. Whyyooshould I put you in safety? You know that's it, since you ask me to doyooit. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to himyoo'were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to beyoodrunk, and you were drunk, too.' Well, what could I answer, especiallyyooas your story is a more likely one than his? for there's nothing butyoopsychology to support his evidence--that's almost unseemly with his uglyyoomug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterateyoodrunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly severalyootimes already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that theyoosecond way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart fromyoothat I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you inyooprison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform youyooof it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,yoothat it won't be to my advantage. Well, secondly, I've come to youyoobecause..."yooyoo"Yes, yes, secondly?" Raskolnikov was listening breathless.yooyoo"Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation. Iyoodon't want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine likingyoofor you, you may believe me or not. And in the third place I've come toyooyou with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrenderyooand confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to myyooadvantage too, for my task will be done. Well, is this open on my partyooor not?"yooyooRaskolnikov thought a minute.yooyoo"Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing butyoopsychology to go on, yet now you've gone on mathematics. Well, what ifyooyou are mistaken yourself, now?"yooyoo"No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact evenyoothen, Providence sent it me."yooyoo"What little fact?"yooyoo"I won't tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I haven'tyoothe right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you. So think it over:yooit makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.yooBelieve me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch."yooyooRaskolnikov smiled malignantly.yooyoo"That's not simply ridiculous, it's positively shameless. Why, even if Iyoowere guilty, which I don't admit, what reason should I have to confess,yoowhen you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?"yooyoo"Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don't put too much faith in words, perhapsyooprison will not be altogether a restful place. That's only theory andyoomy theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I amyoohiding something from you? I can't lay bare everything, he-he! And howyoocan you ask what advantage? Don't you know how it would lessen youryoosentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has takenyoothe crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! Iyooswear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shallyoocome as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all theseyoopsychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crimeyoowill appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth ityoowas an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keepyoomy word."yooyooRaskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sinkyoodejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but hisyoosmile was sad and gentle.yooyoo"No!" he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearancesyoowith Porfiry, "it's not worth it, I don't care about lessening theyoosentence!"yooyoo"That's just what I was afraid of!" Porfiry cried warmly and, as ityooseemed, involuntarily. "That's just what I feared, that you wouldn'tyoocare about the mitigation of sentence."yooyooRaskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.yooyoo"Ah, don't disdain life!" Porfiry went on. "You have a great deal ofyooit still before you. How can you say you don't want a mitigation ofyoosentence? You are an impatient fellow!"yooyoo"A great deal of what lies before me?"yooyoo"Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it? Seekyooand ye shall find. This may be God's means for bringing you to Him. Andyooit's not for ever, the bondage...."yooyoo"The time will be shortened," laughed Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that youyooare afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anywayyoo_you_ shouldn't be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing."yooyoo"Ach, hang it!" Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, asyoothough he did not want to speak aloud.yooyooHe got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again inyooevident despair.yooyoo"Hang it, if you like! You've lost faith and you think that I amyoogrossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much doyooyou understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it brokeyoodown and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out somethingyoobase, that's true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!yooAt least you didn't deceive yourself for long, you went straight to theyoofurthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as oneyooof those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cutsyootheir entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it andyooyou will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too,yoois a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.yooI know you don't believe in it--but don't be over-wise; fling yourselfyoostraight into life, without deliberation; don't be afraid--the floodyoowill bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. Whatyoobank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life beforeyooyou. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech preparedyoobeforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of useyoosome time. That's why I speak. It's as well that you only killed theyooold woman. If you'd invented another theory you might perhaps haveyoodone something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God,yooperhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.yooBut keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the greatyooexpiation before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Sinceyooyou have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justiceyooin it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you don'tyoobelieve it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live ityoodown in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!"yooyooRaskolnikov positively started.yooyoo"But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majesticyoocalm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?"yooyoo"Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that's all. A manyooperhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my dayyoois over. But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.yooThough, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and comeyooto nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into anotheryooclass of men? It's not comfort you regret, with your heart! What ofyooit that perhaps no one will see you for so long? It's not time, butyooyourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. Theyoosun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? At my beingyoosuch a Schiller? I bet you're imagining that I am trying to get roundyooyou by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps you'd better notyoobelieve my word, perhaps you'd better never believe it altogether--I'myoomade that way, I confess it. But let me add, you can judge for yourself,yooI think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest."yooyoo"When do you mean to arrest me?"yooyoo"Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, myyoodear fellow, and pray to God. It's more in your interest, believe me."yooyoo"And what if I run away?" asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.yooyoo"No, you won't run away. A peasant would run away, a fashionableyoodissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man's thought, foryooyou've only to show him the end of your little finger and he'll be readyyooto believe in anything for the rest of his life. But you've ceased toyoobelieve in your theory already, what will you run away with? And whatyoowould you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, andyoowhat you need more than anything in life is a definite position, anyooatmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? Ifyooyou ran away, you'd come back to yourself. _You can't get on withoutyoous._ And if I put you in prison--say you've been there a month, or two,yooor three--remember my word, you'll confess of yourself and perhaps toyooyour own surprise. You won't know an hour beforehand that you are comingyoowith a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, 'to take youryoosuffering.' You don't believe my words now, but you'll come to it ofyooyourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Neveryoomind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don't laugh at it,yoothere's an idea in suffering, Nokolay is right. No, you won't run away,yooRodion Romanovitch."yooyooRaskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.yooyoo"Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only we don'tyoohave a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air."yooyooHe, too, took his cap.yooyoo"Porfiry Petrovitch, please don't take up the notion that I haveyooconfessed to you to-day," Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.yoo"You're a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.yooBut I have admitted nothing, remember that!"yooyoo"Oh, I know that, I'll remember. Look at him, he's trembling! Don'tyoobe uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. Walk about a bit, youyoowon't be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one requestyooto make of you," he added, dropping his voice. "It's an awkward one, butyooimportant. If anything were to happen (though indeed I don't believeyooin it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were takenyooduring these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end toyoothe business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying handsyooon yourself--(it's an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me foryooit) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention theyoostone. It will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts andyoosound decisions to you!"yooyooPorfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. Theyoolatter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till heyoocalculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then heyootoo went hurriedly out of the room.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IIIyooyooHe hurried to Svidrigaïlov's. What he had to hope from that man heyoodid not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having onceyoorecognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.yooyooOn the way, one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigaïlov beenyooto Porfiry's?yooyooAs far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not. Heyoopondered again and again, went over Porfiry's visit; no, he hadn't been,yooof course he hadn't.yooyooBut if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for the present heyoofancied he couldn't. Why? He could not have explained, but if he could,yoohe would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It allyooworried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange toyoosay, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vagueyooanxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more important anxietyyootormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.yooMoreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind wasyooworking better that morning than it had done of late.yooyooAnd was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend withyoothese new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while, for instance, toyoomanoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry's? Was it worthyoowhile to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyoneyoolike Svidrigaïlov?yooyooOh, how sick he was of it all!yooyooAnd yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be expectingyoosomething _new_ from him, information, or means of escape? Men willyoocatch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?yooPerhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlovyoobut some other whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presentedyoohimself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To begyooher tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him asyooan irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that momentyooespecially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not beyoobetter to try Svidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning thatyoohe had long felt that he must see him for some reason.yooyooBut what could they have in common? Their very evil-doing could notyoobe of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidentlyyoodepraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Suchyoostories were told about him. It is true he was befriending KaterinayooIvanovna's children, but who could tell with what motive and what ityoomeant? The man always had some design, some project.yooyooThere was another thought which had been continually hovering of lateyooabout Raskolnikov's mind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was soyoopainful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimesyoothought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov hadyoofound out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had themyoostill? Wasn't it practically certain that he had? And what if, havingyoolearnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use ityooas a weapon against Dounia?yooyooThis idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had neveryoopresented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov.yooThe very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this wouldyootransform everything, even his own position; he would have at once toyooconfess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhapsyooto prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morningyooDounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters inyooPetersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It's true Razumihin was there to protectyooher, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his dutyyooto tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.yooyooIn any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decidedyoofinally. Thank God, the details of the interview were of littleyooconsequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; butyooif Svidrigaïlov were capable... if he were intriguing againstyooDounia--then...yooyooRaskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that monthyoothat he could only decide such questions in one way; "then I shall killyoohim," he thought in cold despair.yooyooA sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle ofyoothe street and began looking about to see where he was and which way heyoowas going. He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces fromyoothe Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey ofyoothe house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wideyooopen; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms wereyoofull to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet andyooviolin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.yooHe was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,yoowhen suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sittingyooat a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.yooRaskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlovyoowas silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikovyooat once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.yooRaskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be lookingyooabsent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.yooHis heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlovyoodid not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was onyoothe point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back hisyoochair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seenyoohim, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much theyoosame as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room. Ayoosly smile came into Svidrigaïlov's face and grew broader andyoobroader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At lastyooSvidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.yooyoo"Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!" he shouted from theyoowindow.yooyooRaskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigaïlov in a tinyyooback room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbersyooof people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to theyoodesperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard ballsyoocould be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stoodyooan open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he foundyooalso a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girlyooof eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat withyooribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing someyooservants' hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment ofyoothe organ.yooyoo"Come, that's enough," Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov'syooentrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.yooShe had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectfulyooexpression in her face.yooyoo"Hey, Philip, a glass!" shouted Svidrigaïlov.yooyoo"I won't drink anything," said Raskolnikov.yooyoo"As you like, I didn't mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don't wantyooanything more to-day, you can go." He poured her out a full glass, andyoolaid down a yellow note.yooyooKatia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,yooin twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov's hand, which heyooallowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailedyooafter her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.yooSvidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about himyoowas already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,yoowas by now an old friend and very obsequious.yooyooThe door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was atyoohome in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern wasyoodirty and wretched, not even second-rate.yooyoo"I was going to see you and looking for you," Raskolnikov began, "butyooI don't know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospectyoojust now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the HayyooMarket. And this isn't the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.yooIt is strange!"yooyoo"Why don't you say at once 'it's a miracle'?"yooyoo"Because it may be only chance."yooyoo"Oh, that's the way with all you folk," laughed Svidrigaïlov. "You won'tyooadmit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you sayyoothat it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, aboutyoohaving an opinion of their own, you can't fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. Iyoodon't mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid toyoohave it. That's how it was you attracted my curiosity."yooyoo"Nothing else?"yooyoo"Well, that's enough, you know," Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated,yoobut only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.yooyoo"I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of havingyoowhat you call an opinion of my own," observed Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. Andyooapropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleepyoofor the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, thereyoois no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,yootold you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do youyooremember?"yooyoo"I don't remember," answered Raskolnikov with surprise.yooyoo"I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stampedyoomechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yetyooprecisely according to the direction, though you are not aware ofyooit. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You giveyooyourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I'myooconvinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselvesyooas they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientificyoomen, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuableyooinvestigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few placesyoowhere there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soulyooof man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.yooAnd it's the administrative centre of all Russia and its character mustyoobe reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor thereyoonow. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk outyooof your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let ityoosink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently seeyoonothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips andyootalking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and atyoolast stand still in the middle of the road. That's not at all the thing.yooSomeone may be watching you besides me, and it won't do you any good.yooIt's nothing really to do with me and I can't cure you, but, of course,yooyou understand me."yooyoo"Do you know that I am being followed?" asked Raskolnikov, lookingyooinquisitively at him.yooyoo"No, I know nothing about it," said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised.yooyoo"Well, then, let us leave me alone," Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.yooyoo"Very good, let us leave you alone."yooyoo"You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed meyootwice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away justyoonow when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it."yooyoo"He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes andyoopretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in youryoodoorway? I saw it."yooyoo"I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself."yooyoo"And I may have had my reasons, though you don't know them."yooyooRaskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in theyoofingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov. For ayoofull minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. Ityoowas a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,yoowith a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehowyootoo blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There wasyoosomething awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked soyoowonderfully young for his age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in lightyoosummer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a hugeyooring with a precious stone in it.yooyoo"Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?" said Raskolnikovyoosuddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. "Evenyoothough perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,yooI don't want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that Iyoodon't prize myself as you probably think I do. I've come to tell you atyooonce that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sisteryooand if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what hasyoobeen discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.yooYou can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in theyoosecond place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying allyoothis time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,yoofor time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late."yooyoo"Why in such haste?" asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously.yooyoo"Everyone has his plans," Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.yooyoo"You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first questionyooyou refuse to answer," Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile. "Youyookeep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me withyoosuspicion. Of course it's perfectly natural in your position. Butyoothough I should like to be friends with you, I shan't trouble myselfyooto convince you of the contrary. The game isn't worth the candle and Iyoowasn't intending to talk to you about anything special."yooyoo"What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me."yooyoo"Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked theyoofantastic nature of your position--that's what it was! Besides you areyoothe brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that personyooI had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which Iyoogathered that you had a great influence over her; isn't that enough?yooHa-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, andyoois difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to meyoonot only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing somethingyoonew. Isn't that so? Isn't that so?" persisted Svidrigaïlov with a slyyoosmile. "Well, can't you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in theyootrain was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on myyoomaking some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!"yooyoo"What profit could you make?"yooyoo"How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend allyoomy time and it's my enjoyment, that's to say it's no great enjoyment,yoobut one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If onlyyooI had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this."yooyooHe pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of ayooterrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.yooyoo"Have you dined, by the way? I've had something and want nothing more.yooI don't drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touchyooanything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and evenyoothat is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to windyoomyself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in ayoopeculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like ayooschoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe," heyoopulled out his watch, "I can spend an hour with you. It's half-pastyoofour now. If only I'd been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalryyooofficer, a photographer, a journalist... I am nothing, no specialty,yooand sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell meyoosomething new."yooyoo"But what are you, and why have you come here?"yooyoo"What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in theyoocavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married MarfayooPetrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!"yooyoo"You are a gambler, I believe?"yooyoo"No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler."yooyoo"You have been a card-sharper then?"yooyoo"Yes, I've been a card-sharper too."yooyoo"Didn't you get thrashed sometimes?"yooyoo"It did happen. Why?"yooyoo"Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have beenyoolively."yooyoo"I won't contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. Iyooconfess that I hastened here for the sake of the women."yooyoo"As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?"yooyoo"Quite so," Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. "What of it? Youyooseem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?"yooyoo"You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?"yooyoo"Vice! Oh, that's what you are after! But I'll answer you in order,yoofirst about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,yoowhat should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since Iyoohave a passion for them? It's an occupation, anyway."yooyoo"So you hope for nothing here but vice?"yooyoo"Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anywayyooI like a direct question. In this vice at least there is somethingyoopermanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,yoosomething present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for everyoosetting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, evenyoowith years. You'll agree it's an occupation of a sort."yooyoo"That's nothing to rejoice at, it's a disease and a dangerous one."yooyoo"Oh, that's what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease likeyooeverything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one mustyooexceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one wayyooor another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderateyooand prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn'tyoothis, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decentyooman ought to put up with being bored, but yet..."yooyoo"And could you shoot yourself?"yooyoo"Oh, come!" Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. "Please don't speak ofyooit," he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shownyooin all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. "I admit it'syooan unpardonable weakness, but I can't help it. I am afraid of death andyooI dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extentyooa mystic?"yooyoo"Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visitingyooyou?"yooyoo"Oh, don't talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confoundyoothem!" he cried with an air of irritation. "Let's rather talk of that...yoothough... H'm! I have not much time, and can't stay long with you,yooit's a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you."yooyoo"What's your engagement, a woman?"yooyoo"Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that's not what I want to talkyooof."yooyoo"And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn'tyoothat affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?"yooyoo"And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me justyoonow, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.yooYou preach to me about vice and æsthetics! You--a Schiller, you--anyooidealist! Of course that's all as it should be and it would beyoosurprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,yoowhat a pity I have no time, for you're a most interesting type! And,yooby-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him."yooyoo"But what a braggart you are," Raskolnikov said with some disgust.yooyoo"Upon my word, I am not," answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. "However, Iyoowon't dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts noyooone? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now whenyooI come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highlyyoointeresting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I've drunk thatyoohalf-glass of champagne and it's gone to my head a little. And besides,yoothere's a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about thatyooI... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?" he asked in alarm.yooyooRaskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and,yooas it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced thatyooSvidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.yooyoo"A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!" Svidrigaïlov begged. "Let them bringyooyou some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won't talk nonsense, aboutyoomyself, I mean. I'll tell you something. If you like I'll tell you how ayoowoman tried 'to save' me, as you would call it? It will be an answer toyooyour first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tellyooyou? It will help to spend the time."yooyoo"Tell me, but I trust that you..."yooyoo"Oh, don't be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,yooAvdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect."yooyooyooyooCHAPTER IVyooyoo"You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself," began Svidrigaïlov, "thatyooI was in the debtors' prison here, for an immense sum, and had notyooany expectation of being able to pay it. There's no need to go intoyooparticulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what ayoopoint of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,yooand very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believeyoothat this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics andyooreproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me whichyooshe kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older thanyooI, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. Thereyoowas so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as toyootell her straight out that I couldn't be absolutely faithful to her.yooThis confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to haveyooliked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling toyoodeceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealousyoowoman, you know, that's the first consideration. After many tears anyoounwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would neveryooleave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that Iyoowould never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I wouldyoonever set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, MarfayooPetrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with heryoosecret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman ofyooour class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited byyooa great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. Onyoothis last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was ayoosensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissoluteyooprofligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealousyoowoman are two very different things, and that's where the troubleyoocame in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certainyoopreconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary peopleyooabout us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather thanyooin anyone's. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that wasyooridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some veryyooridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for theyooinnumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and that's enough, Iyoothink, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wifeyooof a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongueyooand did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed toyooattain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These wereyootimes when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn'tyooput up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such ayoobeautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is thatyooMarfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fellyooin love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, littleyoowonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glanceyooand what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. But AvdotyayooRomanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? Would youyoobelieve it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at firstyoofor my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless receptionyooof her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I don't knowyoowhat it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told AvdotyayooRomanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit ofyootelling literally everyone all our family secrets and continuallyyoocomplaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightfulyoonew friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubtyooAvdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that wereyoocurrent about me.... I don't mind betting that you too have heardyoosomething of the sort already?"yooyoo"I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Isyoothat true?"yooyoo"Don't refer to those vulgar tales, I beg," said Svidrigaïlov withyoodisgust and annoyance. "If you insist on wanting to know about all thatyooidiocy, I will tell you one day, but now..."yooyoo"I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom youyootreated badly."yooyoo"I beg you to drop the subject," Svidrigaïlov interrupted again withyooobvious impatience.yooyoo"Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...yooyou told me about it yourself." Raskolnikov felt more and moreyooirritated.yooyooSvidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caughtyooa flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But Svidrigaïlov restrainedyoohimself and answered very civilly:yooyoo"Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shallyoofeel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Uponyoomy soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure withyoosome people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for havingyoorepeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossipyooabout me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in anyyoocase it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovna's naturalyooaversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--sheyoodid at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once ayoogirl's heart is moved to _pity_, it's more dangerous than anything. Sheyoois bound to want to 'save him,' to bring him to his senses, and liftyoohim up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life andyoousefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at onceyoothat the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.yooI think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch? There's no need. As youyooknow, it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)yooDo you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn'tyooyour sister's fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., asyoothe daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in AsiayooMinor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endureyoomartyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hotyoopincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth oryoofifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert andyoowould have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies andyoovisions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, andyooif she can't get her torture, she'll throw herself out of a window. I'veyooheard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he's said to be a sensible fellow;yoohis surname suggests it, indeed. He's probably a divinity student. Well,yoohe'd better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I amyooproud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, oneyoois apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn't see clearly. Hang ityooall, why is she so handsome? It's not my fault. In fact, it began onyoomy side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna isyooawfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell youyoothis about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, inyoospite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. Thereyoohappened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyedyoowench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from anotheryoovillage--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,yoowailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.yooOne day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue inyoothe garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parashayooalone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,yoowas only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,yooembarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,yoomysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, evenyootears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion foryoopropaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all onyoomy destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finallyyooresorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of theyoofemale heart, a weapon which never fails one. It's the well-knownyooresource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking theyootruth and nothing easier than flattery. If there's the hundredth partyooof a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and thatyooleads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, ityoois just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may beyooa coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse theyooflattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That's so for allyoostages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might beyooseduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I onceyooseduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and heryooprinciples. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady reallyyoohad principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply beingyooutterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered heryooshamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure ofyoothe hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for havingyoosnatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so thatyooI could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.yooI maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee myyootreachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. Inyoofact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she wasyooinnocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations andyoohad succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when Iyooexplained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she wasyoojust as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side ofyooflattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her propertyyoosettled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wineyoonow and talking too much.) I hope you won't be angry if I mention nowyoothat I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.yooBut I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna hadyooseveral times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased byyoothe expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes ayoolight in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger andyoomore unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,yoobut we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in theyoocoarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parashayoocame on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was ayootremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how youryoosister's eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at thisyoomoment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.yooI assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle ofyooher dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to thinkyoothat I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I couldyoobe moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,yoobut by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To whatyooa pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertakeyooanything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that AvdotyayooRomanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that's not the word...yoobut does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived byyooher work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, youyooare frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirtyyoothousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away withyoome here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,yoorapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that timeyoothat if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throatyooand to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended inyoothe catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic Iyoowas when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrellyyooattorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which wouldyooreally have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn't it?yooWouldn't it? I notice that you've begun to be very attentive... youyoointeresting young man...."yooyooSvidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.yooRaskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagneyoothat he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and heyooresolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspiciousyooof Svidrigaïlov.yooyoo"Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you haveyoocome to Petersburg with designs on my sister," he said directly toyooSvidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further.yooyoo"Oh, nonsense," said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. "Why, Iyootold you... besides your sister can't endure me."yooyoo"Yes, I am certain that she can't, but that's not the point."yooyoo"Are you so sure that she can't?" Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes andyoosmiled mockingly. "You are right, she doesn't love me, but you canyoonever be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover andyoomistress. There's always a little corner which remains a secret toyoothe world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it thatyooAvdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?"yooyoo"From some words you've dropped, I notice that you still haveyoodesigns--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them outyoopromptly."yooyoo"What, have I dropped words like that?" Svidrigaïlov asked in naïveyoodismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on hisyoodesigns.yooyoo"Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? Whatyooare you so afraid of now?"yooyoo"Me--afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, _cheryooami_. But what nonsense.... I've drunk too much though, I see that. Iyoowas almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!"yooyooHe snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out ofyoothe window. Philip brought the water.yooyoo"That's all nonsense!" said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting ityooto his head. "But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all youryoosuspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?"yooyoo"You told me so before."yooyoo"Did I? I've forgotten. But I couldn't have told you so for certain foryooI had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I reallyyoohave a betrothed and it's a settled thing, and if it weren't that I haveyoobusiness that can't be put off, I would have taken you to see themyooat once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only tenyoominutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it's anyoointeresting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?yooGoing again?"yooyoo"No, I'm not going away now."yooyoo"Not at all? We shall see. I'll take you there, I'll show you myyoobetrothed, only not now. For you'll soon have to be off. You have to goyooto the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, theyoowoman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you're thinking, that she'syoothe woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, areyooyou listening? She arranged it all for me. You're bored, she said,yooyou want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,yoodepressed person. Do you think I'm light-hearted? No, I'm gloomy. I doyoono harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at ayootime. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she hasyoogot in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife andyoodepart, and she'll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in ouryooclass, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-downyooretired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last threeyooyears with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensibleyoowoman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn't help;yoothere is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn't visit them. Andyoothey've two little nephews on their hands, as though their own childrenyoowere not enough, and they've taken from school their youngest daughter,yooa girl who'll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can beyoomarried. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I presentyoomyself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,yoowith a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinksyooof that? But it's fascinating, isn't it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! Youyooshould have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth payingyooto have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,yoostill in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she hadyoobeen told, no doubt. I don't know how you feel about female faces, butyooto my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tearsyooof bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect littleyoopicture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb's, full little rosyyoolips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I wasyooin a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that isyoothe day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her onyoomy knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunsetyooand I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her thatyoothis is her husband and that this must be so. It's simply delicious! Theyoopresent betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here youyoohave what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha! I've talked to heryootwice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me thatyoopositively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael's Madonna. You know,yoothe Sistine Madonna's face has something fantastic in it, the faceyooof mournful religious ecstasy. Haven't you noticed it? Well, she'syoosomething in that line. The day after we'd been betrothed, I bought heryoopresents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds andyooanother of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with allyoosorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna's face glowed. I sat heryooon my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--sheyooflushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn't want to show it.yooWe were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the firstyootime of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, andyoovowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would makeyoome happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, wouldyoosacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return isyoomy _respect_, and that she wants 'nothing, nothing more from me, noyoopresents.' You'll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from anyooangel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flushyooof maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes isyoorather fascinating! Isn't it fascinating? It's worth paying for, isn'tyooit? Well... listen, we'll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!"yooyoo"The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excitesyooyour sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?"yooyoo"Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily whoyooknows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen aboutyoovirtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!"yooyoo"But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...yoothough you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now."yooyoo"I am always fond of children, very fond of them," laughed Svidrigaïlov.yoo"I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here Iyoovisited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. Youyooprobably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with myyooold friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, whenyooI was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thoughtyooof these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a greatyoodeal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated youngyoopeople, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreamsyooand visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and areyooamassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. Fromyoothe first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to beyooin a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, andyoothere was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there youyoohave progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicelyyoodressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another oneyoo_vis-à-vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can'tyoofancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, atyoolast felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and beganyoowhirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--Iyoolike your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,yoo'Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn't bring children!' Well,yooit's not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical oryoonot. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began byyoosaying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred andyoothat they couldn't distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,yoogave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take themyoohome in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They wereyoolodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from theyoocountry. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard myyooacquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of theiryooown and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered myyooservices and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloonyooby mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered toyooassist in the young girl's education in French and dancing. My offer wasyooaccepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... Ifyooyou like, we'll go and see them, only not just now."yooyoo"Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensualyooman!"yooyoo"Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_yooBut you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasureyooof hearing your outcries!"yooyoo"I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself," muttered Raskolnikovyooangrily.yooyooSvidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,yooand began getting up.yooyoo"I say, but I am drunk, _assez causé_," he said. "It's been a pleasure."yooyoo"I should rather think it must be a pleasure!" cried Raskolnikov,yoogetting up. "No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate toyoodescribe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort inyoohis mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man asyoome.... It's stimulating!"yooyoo"Well, if you come to that," Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinisingyooRaskolnikov with some surprise, "if you come to that, you are a thoroughyoocynic yourself. You've plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understandyooa great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerelyyooregret not having had more talk with you, but I shan't lose sight ofyooyou.... Only wait a bit."yooyooSvidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out afteryoohim. Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected himyoofor a moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupiedyoowith something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excitedyooand uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov hadyoochanged during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneeringyooevery moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. Heyoobecame very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.yooyooThey came out on to the pavement.yooyoo"You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.yooOnly _adieu, mon plaisir_, may we meet again."yooyooAnd he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VyooyooRaskolnikov walked after him.yooyoo"What's this?" cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, "I thought I said..."yooyoo"It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now."yooyoo"What?"yooyooBoth stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring theiryoostrength.yooyoo"From all your half tipsy stories," Raskolnikov observed harshly, "I amyoo_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, butyooare pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sisteryooreceived a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit stillyooall this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but thatyoomeans nothing. I should like to make certain myself."yooyooRaskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what heyoowished to make certain.yooyoo"Upon my word! I'll call the police!"yooyoo"Call away!"yooyooAgain they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigaïlov'syooface changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was notyoofrightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.yooyoo"What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,yoothough I am devoured by curiosity. It's a fantastic affair. I've put ityoooff till another time, but you're enough to rouse the dead.... Well, letyoous go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,yooto get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go toyoospend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going to follow me?"yooyoo"I'm coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, toyoosay I'm sorry not to have been at the funeral."yooyoo"That's as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has takenyoothe three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of someyooorphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady byyoodepositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children ofyooKaterina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told heryootoo the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.yooIt produced an indescribable effect on her. That's why Sofya Semyonovnayoohas been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady isyoostaying for the time."yooyoo"No matter, I'll come all the same."yooyoo"As you like, it's nothing to me, but I won't come with you; here we areyooat home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicionyoojust because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubledyooyou with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; Iyoodon't mind betting it's that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!"yooyoo"And to listen at doors!"yooyoo"Ah, that's it, is it?" laughed Svidrigaïlov. "Yes, I should have beenyoosurprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!yooThough I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to andyoowere telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? PerhapsyooI am quite behind the times and can't understand. For goodness' sake,yooexplain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!"yooyoo"You couldn't have heard anything. You're making it all up!"yooyoo"But I'm not talking about that (though I did hear something). No, I'myootalking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller inyooyou is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen atyoodoors. If that's how you feel, go and inform the police that you hadyoothis mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you areyooconvinced that one mustn't listen at doors, but one may murder old womenyooat one's pleasure, you'd better be off to America and make haste. Run,yooyoung man! There may still be time. I'm speaking sincerely. Haven't youyoothe money? I'll give you the fare."yooyoo"I'm not thinking of that at all," Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.yooyoo"I understand (but don't put yourself out, don't discuss it if you don'tyoowant to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,yooaren't they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They areyoonothing to you now, ha-ha! You'll say you are still a man and a citizen.yooIf so you ought not to have got into this coil. It's no use taking up ayoojob you are not fit for. Well, you'd better shoot yourself, or don't youyoowant to?"yooyoo"You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you."yooyoo"What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. Youyoosee, that's the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home.yooDon't you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Hereyoois Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has sheyoogone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won't be till late inyoothe evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and seeyoome, didn't you? Here we are. Madame Resslich's not at home. She is ayoowoman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She mightyoohave been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now,yoosee! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lotyooI've got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. Iyoomustn't waste any more time. The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,yooand here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? I'm going toyoothe Islands. Would you like a lift? I'll take this carriage. Ah, youyoorefuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come onyooto rain. Never mind, we'll put down the hood...."yooyooSvidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that hisyoosuspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering ayooword he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had onlyyooturned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not ayoohundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But heyoohad turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew himyooaway from Svidrigaïlov.yooyoo"To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from thatyoocoarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!" he cried.yooyooRaskolnikov's judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there wasyoosomething about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even ayoomysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convincedyoothat Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresomeyooand unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.yooyooWhen he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, asyoousual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing andyoobegan gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.yooyooHe met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeingyooher. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and wasyoostruck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to callyooto him or not. Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from theyoodirection of the Hay Market.yooyooHe seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to theyoobridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoidyooRaskolnikov's seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and hadyoobeen making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her notyooto speak to her brother, but to come to him.yooyooThat was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up toyooSvidrigaïlov.yooyoo"Let us make haste away," Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, "I don't wantyooRodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you I've beenyoositting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up andyooI had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard ofyoomy letter to you and suspects something. It wasn't you who told him, ofyoocourse, but if not you, who then?"yooyoo"Well, we've turned the corner now," Dounia interrupted, "and my brotheryoowon't see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.yooSpeak to me here. You can tell it all in the street."yooyoo"In the first place, I can't say it in the street; secondly, you mustyoohear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....yooOh well, if you won't agree to come with me, I shall refuse to giveyooany explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget thatyooa very curious secret of your beloved brother's is entirely in myyookeeping."yooyooDounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov withyoosearching eyes.yooyoo"What are you afraid of?" he observed quietly. "The town is not theyoocountry. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you."yooyoo"Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?"yooyoo"No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether sheyoois at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmotheryooto-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time Iyoodon't want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spokenyooto you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing likeyoothis. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That's the porteryooof our house--he knows me very well; you see, he's bowing; he sees I'myoocoming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and youyoowill be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuseyoomy putting things so coarsely. I haven't a flat to myself; SofyayooSemyonovna's room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. Theyoowhole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?yooAm I really so terrible?"yooyooSvidrigaïlov's lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was inyoono smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.yooHe spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did notyoonotice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark thatyooshe was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible toyooher.yooyoo"Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in theyooleast afraid of you. Lead the way," she said with apparent composure,yoobut her face was very pale.yooyooSvidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia's room.yooyoo"Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. Howyoounfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she's gone out, ityoocan only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....yooI've been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovnayoodoes not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day ifyooyou like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,yoomy landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show youyoomy chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into twoyooperfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must lookyoointo them with some attention."yooyooSvidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia wasyoolooking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in theyoofurniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,yoofor instance, that Svidrigaïlov's flat was exactly between two sets ofyooalmost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directlyyoofrom the passage, but through the landlady's two almost empty rooms.yooUnlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Douniayoothe two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, notyooknowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened toyooexplain.yooyoo"Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it's locked.yooBy the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought ityoofrom my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side ofyoothe door is Sofya Semyonovna's table; she sat there talking to RodionyooRomanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, foryootwo hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, whatyoodo you think?"yooyoo"You listened?"yooyoo"Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can't sit down here."yooyooHe brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered heryooa chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least sevenyoofeet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes whichyoohad once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more lookedyooabout her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidentlyyoodid not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position ofyooSvidrigaïlov's lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to askyoowhether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her fromyooasking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparablyyoogreater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.yooyoo"Here is your letter," she said, laying it on the table. "Can it be trueyoowhat you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.yooYou hint at it too clearly; you daren't deny it now. I must tell youyoothat I'd heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don't believe ayooword of it. It's a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the storyyooand why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised toyooprove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don't believe you! I don'tyoobelieve you!"yooyooDounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colouryoorushed to her face.yooyoo"If you didn't believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?yooWhy have you come? Simply from curiosity?"yooyoo"Don't torment me. Speak, speak!"yooyoo"There's no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thoughtyooyou would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was notyoowith you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It's spirited ofyooyou, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everythingyoois divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You'veyoojust seen him yourself. What did you think of him?"yooyoo"Surely that's not the only thing you are building on?"yooyoo"No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successiveyooevenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I've shown you where they sat. He madeyooa full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, ayoopawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sisteryootoo, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while heyoowas murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought withyoohim. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money andyoovarious things.... He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,yoothe only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by wordyooor deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Don'tyoobe anxious, she won't betray him."yooyoo"It cannot be," muttered Dounia, with white lips. She gasped for breath.yoo"It cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....yooIt's a lie, a lie!"yooyoo"He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things. It's trueyoothat by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hidyoothem under a stone, where they are now. But that was because he daredyoonot make use of them."yooyoo"But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?" cried Dounia,yooand she jumped up from the chair. "Why, you know him, and you've seenyoohim, can he be a thief?"yooyooShe seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten heryoofear.yooyoo"There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,yooAvdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I'veyooheard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely heyoothought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not haveyoobelieved it myself if I'd been told of it as you have, but I believe myyooown ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, butyooshe did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes atyoolast."yooyoo"What... were the causes?"yooyoo"It's a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here's... how shall I tellyooyou?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consideryoothat a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, ayoosolitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! It's galling too, ofyoocourse, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that ifyoohe had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, hisyoowhole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that threeyoothousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodgingyooin a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his socialyooposition and his sister's and mother's position too. Above all, vanity,yoopride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualitiesyootoo.... I am not blaming him, please don't think it; besides, it's notyoomy business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of ayoosort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,yoothat is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to theiryoosuperiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, thatyoois. It's all right as a theory, _une théorie comme une autre_. Napoleonyooattracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that ayoogreat many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but haveyoooverstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fanciedyoothat he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. Heyoohas suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that heyoocould make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,yooand so he is not a man of genius. And that's humiliating for a young manyooof any pride, in our day especially...."yooyoo"But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is he like that?"yooyoo"Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it wasyooever in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas,yooAvdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed toyoothe fantastic, the chaotic. But it's a misfortune to be broad withoutyooa special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together onyoothis subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why,yooyou used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talkingyooat the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. Thereyooare no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,yooAvdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow foryoohimself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for theyoomost part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almostyooill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. Iyoonever blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. Butyoowe've talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as toyoointerest you in my opinions.... You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna."yooyoo"I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all isyoopermitted. Razumihin brought it to me."yooyoo"Mr. Razumihin? Your brother's article? In a magazine? Is there such anyooarticle? I didn't know. It must be interesting. But where are you going,yooAvdotya Romanovna?"yooyoo"I want to see Sofya Semyonovna," Dounia articulated faintly. "How do Iyoogo to her? She has come in, perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhapsyooshe..."yooyooAvdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.yooyoo"Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.yooShe was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be inyootill quite late."yooyoo"Ah, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all theyootime.... I don't believe you! I don't believe you!" cried Dounia,yoocompletely losing her head.yooyooAlmost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste toyoogive her.yooyoo"Avdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.yooDrink a little...."yooyooHe sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.yooyoo"It has acted violently," Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning.yoo"Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he has friends. We willyoosave him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money, I can getyooa ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he will do all sorts ofyoogood deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a greatyooman yet. Well, how are you? How do you feel?"yooyoo"Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go..."yooyoo"Where are you going?"yooyoo"To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came inyooat that door and now it is locked. When did you manage to lock it?"yooyoo"We couldn't be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am faryoofrom jeering; it's simply that I'm sick of talking like this. But howyoocan you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will driveyoohim to fury, and he will give himself up. Let me tell you, he is alreadyyoobeing watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be givingyoohim away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. Heyoocan still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.yooI asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and toyooconsider it thoroughly. But do sit down!"yooyoo"How can you save him? Can he really be saved?"yooyooDounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her.yooyoo"It all depends on you, on you, on you alone," he began with glowingyooeyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words foryooemotion.yooyooDounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.yooyoo"You... one word from you, and he is saved. I... I'll save him. I haveyoomoney and friends. I'll send him away at once. I'll get a passport,yootwo passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capableyoopeople.... If you like, I'll take a passport for you... for youryoomother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I loveyooyou beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, letyoome.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, 'do that,'yooand I'll do it. I'll do everything. I will do the impossible. What youyoobelieve, I will believe. I'll do anything--anything! Don't, don't lookyooat me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?..."yooyooHe was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go toyoohis head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.yooyoo"Open it! Open it!" she called, shaking the door. "Open it! Is there noyooone there?"yooyooSvidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowlyyoobroke into an angry mocking smile.yooyoo"There is no one at home," he said quietly and emphatically. "Theyoolandlady has gone out, and it's waste of time to shout like that. Youyooare only exciting yourself uselessly."yooyoo"Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!"yooyoo"I have lost the key and cannot find it."yooyoo"This is an outrage," cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She rushedyooto the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with ayoolittle table.yooyooShe did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watchedyooevery movement he made.yooyooSvidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.yooHe was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face wasyoopale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.yooyoo"You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case youyoomay be sure I've taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. TheyooKapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am atyooleast twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.yooFor you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willingyooactually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. Howyooshould a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?yooSo that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.yooIt is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna."yooyoo"Scoundrel!" whispered Dounia indignantly.yooyoo"As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a generalyooproposition. It's my personal conviction that you are perfectlyyooright--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need haveyoono remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of youryooown accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting toyoocircumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Thinkyooabout it. Your brother's and your mother's fate are in your hands. Iyoowill be your slave... all my life... I will wait here."yooyooSvidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She hadyoonot the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides, sheyooknew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked ityooand laid it in her hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.yooyoo"Aha! So that's it, is it?" he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.yoo"Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. You've made thingsyoowonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get theyoorevolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it's my revolver, an old friend!yooAnd how I've hunted for it! The shooting lessons I've given you in theyoocountry have not been thrown away."yooyoo"It's not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,yoowretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I beganyooto suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, Iyooswear I'll kill you." She was frantic.yooyoo"But your brother? I ask from curiosity," said Svidrigaïlov, stillyoostanding where he was.yooyoo"Inform, if you want to! Don't stir! Don't come nearer! I'll shoot! Youyoopoisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!" She held theyoorevolver ready.yooyoo"Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?"yooyoo"You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I knowyooyou went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing....yooIt must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!"yooyoo"Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you wouldyoohave been the cause."yooyoo"You are lying! I hated you always, always...."yooyoo"Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softenedyooto me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Do you rememberyoothat moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?"yooyoo"That's a lie," there was a flash of fury in Dounia's eyes, "that's ayoolie and a libel!"yooyoo"A lie? Well, if you like, it's a lie. I made it up. Women ought notyooto be reminded of such things," he smiled. "I know you will shoot, youyoopretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!"yooyooDounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring theyoodistance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip wasyoowhite and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He hadyoonever seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the momentyooshe raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang ofyooanguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. Theyoobullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still andyoolaughed softly.yooyoo"The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. What's this?yooBlood?" he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowedyooin a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have justyoograzed the skin.yooyooDounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much inyooterror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand whatyooshe was doing and what was going on.yooyoo"Well, you missed! Fire again, I'll wait," said Svidrigaïlov softly,yoostill smiling, but gloomily. "If you go on like that, I shall have timeyooto seize you before you cock again."yooyooDounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.yooyoo"Let me be," she cried in despair. "I swear I'll shoot again. I... I'llyookill you."yooyoo"Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don't...yoothen." His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shotyooagain: it missed fire.yooyoo"You haven't loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another chargeyoothere. Get it ready, I'll wait."yooyooHe stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wildyoodetermination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Douniayoosaw that he would sooner die than let her go. "And... now, of course sheyoowould kill him, at two paces!" Suddenly she flung away the revolver.yooyoo"She's dropped it!" said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deepyoobreath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not onlyyoothe fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.yooIt was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,yoowhich he could not himself have defined.yooyooHe went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did notyooresist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.yooHe tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able toyooutter a sound.yooyoo"Let me go," Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now wasyooquite different.yooyoo"Then you don't love me?" he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.yooyoo"And... and you can't? Never?" he whispered in despair.yooyoo"Never!"yooyooThere followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart ofyooSvidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenlyyoohe withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.yooAnother moment passed.yooyoo"Here's the key."yooyooHe took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the tableyoobehind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.yooyoo"Take it! Make haste!"yooyooHe looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table toyootake the key.yooyoo"Make haste! Make haste!" repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turningyooor moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of thatyoo"make haste."yooyooDounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked ityooquickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, sheyooran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.yooyooSvidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last heyooslowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. Ayoostrange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile ofyoodespair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.yooHe looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.yooThe revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenlyyoocaught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocketyoothree-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were stillyootwo charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. Heyoothought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and wentyooout.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIyooyooHe spent that evening till ten o'clock going from one low haunt toyooanother. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certainyooyoo"villain and tyrant,"yooyoo"began kissing Katia."yooyooSvidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers andyoothe waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to theseyooclerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to theyooleft and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasureyoogarden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lankyyoothree-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides ayoo"Vauxhall," which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too wasyooserved, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.yooA chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressedyooGerman clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. Theyooclerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.yooSvidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them foryooa quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was noyoopossibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain wasyoothat one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded inyooselling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with hisyoocompanion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoonyoobelonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seemyootroublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out ofyoothe garden. It was about six o'clock. He had not drunk a drop of wineyooall this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances thanyooanything.yooyooIt was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came overyoothe sky about ten o'clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rainyoocame down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on theyooearth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and eachyooflash lasted while one could count five.yooyooDrenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened theyoobureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,yooputting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,yoobut, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and theyoorain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the roomyoowithout locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.yooyooShe was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. Sheyoowas giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,yoolooking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away atyooonce in indescribable terror.yooyooSvidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.yooShe timidly prepared to listen.yooyoo"I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna," said Svidrigaïlov, "andyooas I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make someyooarrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said toyooyou, you need not tell me." (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) "Thoseyoopeople have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and youryoobrother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to themyooI've put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You hadyoobetter take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, takeyoothem! Well now, that's settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to theyoovalue of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely foryooyourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no oneyooknows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go onyooliving in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is noyooneed for it now."yooyoo"I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and myyoostepmother," said Sonia hurriedly, "and if I've said so little... pleaseyoodon't consider..."yooyoo"That's enough! that's enough!"yooyoo"But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,yoobut I don't need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don't think meyooungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money...."yooyoo"It's for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don't waste wordsyooover it. I haven't time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitchyoohas two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia." (Sonia lookedyoowildly at him, and started.) "Don't be uneasy, I know all about it fromyoohimself and I am not a gossip; I won't tell anyone. It was good adviceyoowhen you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be muchyoobetter for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go andyooyou will follow him. That's so, isn't it? And if so, you'll need money.yooYou'll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the sameyooas my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to payyoowhat's owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations soyooheedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna's debt and notyooyours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.yooYou can't get through the world like that. If you are ever questionedyooabout me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don't sayyooanything about my coming to see you now and don't show the money toyooanyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye." (He got up.) "Myyoogreetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you'd better put the moneyyoofor the present in Mr. Razumihin's keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Ofyoocourse you do. He's not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...yoowhen the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully."yooyooSonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.yooShe longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments sheyoodid not dare and did not know how to begin.yooyoo"How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?"yooyoo"Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,yooSofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use toyooothers. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.yooTell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sureyooto."yooyooHe went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vagueyooapprehension.yooyooIt appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,yoohe made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain stillyoopersisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat whereyoothe parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in VassilyevskyyooIsland. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visityooat first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could beyoovery fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed veryyoointelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov hadyooprobably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doingyoovanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to seeyooSvidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began theyooconversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a directyooquestion, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if sheyoowere obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlovyoowould like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested andyooalmost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and onlyyooby degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On otheryoooccasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time ArkadyyooIvanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing hisyoobetrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that sheyoohad already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.yooyooSvidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very importantyooaffairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought heryoofifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present fromyoohim, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling presentyoobefore their wedding. The logical connection of the present with hisyooimmediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for thatyoopurpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all wentyoooff very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,yoothe inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On theyooother hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforcedyooby tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigaïlov got up,yoolaughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soonyoocome back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, ayoosort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, thoughyoohe felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would beyooimmediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. Heyoowent away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, butyoothe tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some ofyoothe most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov wasyooa great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of greatyoowealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would startyoooff on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so thatyoothere was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that heyoowas wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,yooand all these people of high society didn't think of what was said ofyoothem and didn't stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like thatyooon purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not ayooword should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, andyoothe money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, theyoocook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be saidyooto that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat upyoowhispering till two o'clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,yooamazed and rather sorrowful.yooyooSvidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on theyooway back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaringyoowind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the blackyoowaters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.yooBut he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned andyoowent towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a longyootime, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on theyoowooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right sideyooof the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately thatyoothere was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairlyyoolarge, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He wasyoonot mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken placeyoothat he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,yooblackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there wereyoolights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and askedyooa ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,yooscanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to ayooclose and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, underyoothe stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellowyoolooked inquiringly.yooyoo"Is there tea?" asked Svidrigaïlov.yooyoo"Yes, sir."yooyoo"What else is there?"yooyoo"Veal, vodka, savouries."yooyoo"Bring me tea and veal."yooyoo"And you want nothing else?" he asked with apparent surprise.yooyoo"Nothing, nothing."yooyooThe ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.yooyoo"It must be a nice place," thought Svidrigaïlov. "How was it I didn'tyooknow it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and haveyoohad some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayyoohere?"yooyooHe lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was ayooroom so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;yooit had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stainedyoochair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though theyyoowere made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dustyyoothat the pattern was indistinguishable, though the generalyoocolour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut shortyooby the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just underyoothe stairs.yooyooSvidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank intoyoothought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shoutyooin the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased fromyoothe moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding andyooalmost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.yooyooSvidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he sawyoolight through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. Theyooroom, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One ofyoothem, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standingyooin the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart toyoopreserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproachedyoothe other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. Heyoodeclared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turnyoohim out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees ityooall. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had theyooair of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can't. He sometimesyooturned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had notyoothe slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. Ayoocandle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearlyyooempty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregsyooof stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned awayyooindifferently and sat down on the bed.yooyooThe ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist askingyoohim again whether he didn't want anything more, and again receiving ayoonegative reply, finally withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink ayooglass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He beganyooto feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in theyooblanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. "It would have been betteryooto be well for the occasion," he thought with a smile. The room wasyooclose, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heardyooa mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and ofyooleather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. Heyoofelt a longing to fix his imagination on something. "It must be a gardenyoounder the window," he thought. "There's a sound of trees. How I dislikeyoothe sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one ayoohorrid feeling." He remembered how he had disliked it when he passedyooPetrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the LittleyooNeva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. "I never haveyooliked water," he thought, "even in a landscape," and he suddenly smiledyooagain at a strange idea: "Surely now all these questions of taste andyoocomfort ought not to matter, but I've become more particular, like anyooanimal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I oughtyooto have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,yooha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, whyyoohaven't I put out the candle?" he blew it out. "They've gone to bed nextyoodoor," he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. "Well, now, MarfayooPetrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it's dark, and the veryyootime and place for you. But now you won't come!"yooyooHe suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design onyooDounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin'syookeeping. "I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, toyootease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He's gone through ayoogood deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he's got overyoohis nonsense. But now he's _too_ eager for life. These young menyooare contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him pleaseyoohimself, it's nothing to do with me."yooyooHe could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia's image rose before him,yooand a shudder ran over him. "No, I must give up all that now," heyoothought, rousing himself. "I must think of something else. It's queeryooand funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularlyyoodesired to avenge myself even, and that's a bad sign, a bad sign, a badyoosign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that'syooa bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!yooBut--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of meyoosomehow...."yooyooHe ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia's imageyoorose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,yooshe had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so thatyoohe might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a handyooto defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at thatyooinstant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at hisyooheart...yooyoo"Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!"yooyooHe was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenlyyoosomething seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. Heyoostarted. "Ugh! hang it! I believe it's a mouse," he thought, "that's theyooveal I left on the table." He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off theyooblanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran overyoohis leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shakingyoowith feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.yooHe shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.yooHe tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags withoutyooleaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand andyoosuddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in oneyooinstant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and downyoohis back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.yooyooThe room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanketyooas before. The wind was howling under the window. "How disgusting," heyoothought with annoyance.yooyooHe got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to theyoowindow. "It's better not to sleep at all," he decided. There was a coldyoodamp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew theyooblanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking ofyooanything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,yooincoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through hisyoomind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, oryoothe dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the treesyooroused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwellingyooon images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,yoowarm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous countryyoocottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, withyooflower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, wasyoosurrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted withyoorich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticedyooparticularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrantyoonarcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He wasyooreluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and cameyoointo a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,yoothe doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.yooThe floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windowsyoowere open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds wereyoochirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a tableyoocovered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin wasyoocovered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths ofyooflowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in ayoowhite muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, asyoothough carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there wasyooa wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile ofyooher face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on heryoopale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.yooSvidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candleyoobeside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.yooShe was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyedyooherself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childishyoosoul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and tornyoofrom her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, onyooa dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....yooyooSvidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to theyoowindow. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiouslyyoointo the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered withyoohis shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have beenyoosomething like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,yooprobably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops ofyoorain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark asyooin a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs ofyooobjects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,yoogazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followedyooby a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. "Ah, theyoosignal! The river is overflowing," he thought. "By morning it will beyooswirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements andyoocellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rainyooand wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time isyooit now?" And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock onyoothe wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.yooyoo"Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I'll go out at onceyoostraight to the park. I'll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,yooso that as soon as one's shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip onyooone's head."yooyooHe moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on hisyoowaistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,yoointo the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleepyoosomewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to payyoohim for the room and leave the hotel. "It's the best minute; I couldn'tyoochoose a better."yooyooHe walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without findingyooanyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corneryoobetween an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange objectyoowhich seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a littleyoogirl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with heryooclothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid ofyooSvidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her bigyooblack eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have beenyoocrying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child's faceyoowas pale and tired, she was numb with cold. "How can she have come here?yooShe must have hidden here and not slept all night." He began questioningyooher. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her babyyoolanguage, something about "mammy" and that "mammy would beat her," andyooabout some cup that she had "bwoken." The child chattered on withoutyoostopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was ayooneglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the serviceyooof the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had brokenyooa cup of her mother's and was so frightened that she had run away theyooevening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in theyoorain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard andyoospent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darknessyooand the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in hisyooarms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressingyooher. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were asyoowet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he hadyooundressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her inyoothe blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then heyoosank into dreary musing again.yooyoo"What folly to trouble myself," he decided suddenly with an oppressiveyoofeeling of annoyance. "What idiocy!" In vexation he took up the candleyooto go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.yoo"Damn the child!" he thought as he opened the door, but he turned againyooto see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.yooThe child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,yooand her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemedyoobrighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. "It's a flushyooof fever," thought Svidrigaïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, asyoothough she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips wereyoohot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her longyooblack eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and ayoosly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the littleyoogirl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted inyooa smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying toyoocontrol them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,yooa broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quiteyoounchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, theyooshameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; theyyooturned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invitedyoohim.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in thatyoolaugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. "What,yooat five years old?" Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. "What doesyooit mean?" And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holdingyooout her arms.... "Accursed child!" Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his handyooto strike her, but at that moment he woke up.yooyooHe was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had notyoobeen lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.yooyoo"I've had nightmare all night!" He got up angrily, feeling utterlyyooshattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he couldyoosee nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,yooput on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in hisyoopocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of hisyoopocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a fewyoolines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with hisyooelbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Someyooflies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still onyoothe table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand beganyootrying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.yooAt last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, heyoostarted, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later heyoowas in the street.yooyooA thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov walked along theyooslippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturingyoothe waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,yoothe wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last theyoobush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to thinkyooof something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.yooThe bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected withyootheir closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body andyoohe began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and readyooeach carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement andyoocame to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path withyooits tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; deadyoodrunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high toweryoostood up on the left. "Bah!" he shouted, "here is a place. Why shouldyooit be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witnessyooanyway...."yooyooHe almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street whereyoothere was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates ofyoothe house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,yoowrapped in a grey soldier's coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on hisyoohead. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. Hisyooface wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourlyyooprinted on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,yooSvidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutesyoowithout speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a manyoonot drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying ayooword.yooyoo"What do you want here?" he said, without moving or changing hisyooposition.yooyoo"Nothing, brother, good morning," answered Svidrigaïlov.yooyoo"This isn't the place."yooyoo"I am going to foreign parts, brother."yooyoo"To foreign parts?"yooyoo"To America."yooyoo"America."yooyooSvidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised hisyooeyebrows.yooyoo"I say, this is not the place for such jokes!"yooyoo"Why shouldn't it be the place?"yooyoo"Because it isn't."yooyoo"Well, brother, I don't mind that. It's a good place. When you areyooasked, you just say he was going, he said, to America."yooyooHe put the revolver to his right temple.yooyoo"You can't do it here, it's not the place," cried Achilles, rousingyoohimself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.yooyooSvidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIIyooyooThe same day, about seven o'clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was onyoohis way to his mother's and sister's lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev'syoohouse which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up fromyoothe street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though stillyoohesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:yoohis decision was taken.yooyoo"Besides, it doesn't matter, they still know nothing," he thought, "andyoothey are used to thinking of me as eccentric."yooyooHe was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with ayoonight's rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, theyooinward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent allyoothe previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached ayoodecision.yooyooHe knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was notyooat home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first PulcheriayooAlexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him byyoothe hand and drew him into the room.yooyoo"Here you are!" she began, faltering with joy. "Don't be angry withyoome, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing notyoocrying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I've gotyoointo such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I've been like that everyoosince your father's death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, youyoomust be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are."yooyoo"I was in the rain yesterday, mother...." Raskolnikov began.yooyoo"No, no," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, "you thought Iyoowas going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don't beyooanxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I've learned the waysyoohere and truly I see for myself that they are better. I've made up myyoomind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you toyoogive an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have,yooor what ideas you are hatching; so it's not for me to keep nudging youryooelbow, asking you what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! whyyooam I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading youryooarticle in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitchyoobrought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: 'There,yoofoolish one,' I thought, 'that's what he is busy about; that's theyoosolution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He mayyoohave some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and Iyooworry him and upset him.' I read it, my dear, and of course there was ayoogreat deal I did not understand; but that's only natural--how should I?"yooyoo"Show me, mother."yooyooRaskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruousyooas it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange andyoobitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time heyoosees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted onlyyooa moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbedyoowith anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the precedingyoomonths. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.yooyoo"But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that youyoowill very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in theyooworld of Russian thought. And they dared to think you were mad! Youyoodon't know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures,yoohow could they understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all butyoobelieving it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice toyoomagazines--the first time poems (I've got the manuscript and will showyooyou) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy ityooout) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren't! I wasyoobreaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and youryooclothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolishyooI was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect andyootalent. No doubt you don't care about that for the present and you areyoooccupied with much more important matters...."yooyoo"Dounia's not at home, mother?"yooyoo"No, Rodya. I often don't see her; she leaves me alone. DmitriyooProkofitch comes to see me, it's so good of him, and he always talksyooabout you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I don't say thatyooDounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She hasyooher ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late andyooI never have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that Douniayoohas far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don'tyooknow what it will all lead to. You've made me so happy by coming now,yooRodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I'll tellyooher: 'Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been allyoothis time?' You mustn't spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,yoobut if you can't, it doesn't matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway,yoothat you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read whatyooyou write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you'llyoocome yourself to see me. What could be better? Here you've come now toyoocomfort your mother, I see that."yooyooHere Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.yooyoo"Here I am again! Don't mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am Iyoositting here?" she cried, jumping up. "There is coffee and I don't offeryooyou any. Ah, that's the selfishness of old age. I'll get it at once!"yooyoo"Mother, don't trouble, I am going at once. I haven't come for that.yooPlease listen to me."yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.yooyoo"Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you areyootold about me, will you always love me as you do now?" he asked suddenlyyoofrom the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words andyoonot weighing them.yooyoo"Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?yooWhy, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn't believeyooanyone, I should refuse to listen."yooyoo"I've come to assure you that I've always loved you and I am gladyoothat we are alone, even glad Dounia is out," he went on with the sameyooimpulse. "I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, youyoomust believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that allyooyou thought about me, that I was cruel and didn't care about you, wasyooall a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that's enough:yooI thought I must do this and begin with this...."yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to heryoobosom and weeping gently.yooyoo"I don't know what is wrong with you, Rodya," she said at last. "I'veyoobeen thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I seeyoothat there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that's why you areyoomiserable. I've foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speakingyooabout it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sisteryoolay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. Iyoocaught something, but I couldn't make it out. I felt all the morningyooas though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expectingyoosomething, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? Youyooare going away somewhere?"yooyoo"Yes."yooyoo"That's what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you needyoome. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and SofyayooSemyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look uponyooher as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.yooBut... where... are you going?"yooyoo"Good-bye, mother."yooyoo"What, to-day?" she cried, as though losing him for ever.yooyoo"I can't stay, I must go now...."yooyoo"And can't I come with you?"yooyoo"No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps willyooreach Him."yooyoo"Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That's right, that'syooright. Oh, God, what are we doing?"yooyooYes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, thatyoohe was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awfulyoomonths his heart was softened. He fell down before her, he kissed heryoofeet and both wept, embracing. And she was not surprised and did notyooquestion him this time. For some days she had realised that somethingyooawful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute hadyoocome for him.yooyoo"Rodya, my darling, my first born," she said sobbing, "now you are justyooas when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me andyookiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted usyoosimply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often weyoowept together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if I've been cryingyoolately, it's that my mother's heart had a foreboding of trouble. Theyoofirst time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrivedyoohere, I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-dayyoowhen I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour hadyoocome. Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?"yooyoo"No!"yooyoo"You'll come again?"yooyoo"Yes... I'll come."yooyoo"Rodya, don't be angry, I don't dare to question you. I know I mustn't.yooOnly say two words to me--is it far where you are going?"yooyoo"Very far."yooyoo"What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for you?"yooyoo"What God sends... only pray for me." Raskolnikov went to the door, butyooshe clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face workedyoowith terror.yooyoo"Enough, mother," said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.yooyoo"Not for ever, it's not yet for ever? You'll come, you'll comeyooto-morrow?"yooyoo"I will, I will, good-bye." He tore himself away at last.yooyooIt was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.yooRaskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish allyoobefore sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up theyoostairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch himyoointently. "Can anyone have come to see me?" he wondered. He had ayoodisgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. Sheyoowas sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she hadyoobeen waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose fromyoothe sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him,yoobetrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw atyooonce that she knew.yooyoo"Am I to come in or go away?" he asked uncertainly.yooyoo"I've been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.yooWe thought that you would be sure to come there."yooyooRaskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.yooyoo"I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at thisyoomoment to be able to control myself."yooyooHe glanced at her mistrustfully.yooyoo"Where were you all night?"yooyoo"I don't remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mindyooonce for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember thatyooI wanted to end it all there, but... I couldn't make up my mind," heyoowhispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.yooyoo"Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna andyooI. Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!"yooyooRaskolnikov smiled bitterly.yooyoo"I haven't faith, but I have just been weeping in mother's arms; Iyoohaven't faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. I don't knowyoohow it is, Dounia, I don't understand it."yooyoo"Have you been at mother's? Have you told her?" cried Dounia,yoohorror-stricken. "Surely you haven't done that?"yooyoo"No, I didn't tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.yooShe heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands ityooalready. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I don't know why I didyoogo. I am a contemptible person, Dounia."yooyoo"A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, aren'tyooyou?"yooyoo"Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought ofyoodrowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought thatyooif I had considered myself strong till now I'd better not be afraid ofyoodisgrace," he said, hurrying on. "It's pride, Dounia."yooyoo"Pride, Rodya."yooyooThere was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be gladyooto think that he was still proud.yooyoo"You don't think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?" heyooasked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.yooyoo"Oh, Rodya, hush!" cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for twoyoominutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at theyooother end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he gotyooup.yooyoo"It's late, it's time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But Iyoodon't know why I am going to give myself up."yooyooBig tears fell down her cheeks.yooyoo"You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?"yooyoo"You doubted it?"yooyooShe threw her arms round him.yooyoo"Aren't you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?" sheyoocried, holding him close and kissing him.yooyoo"Crime? What crime?" he cried in sudden fury. "That I killed a vileyoonoxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killingyooher was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of pooryoopeople. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinkingyooof expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? 'Ayoocrime! a crime!' Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,yoonow that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. It's simplyyoobecause I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,yooperhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!"yooyoo"Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood?" criedyooDounia in despair.yooyoo"Which all men shed," he put in almost frantically, "which flows and hasyooalways flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for whichyoomen are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors ofyoomankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted toyoodo good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deedsyooto make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simplyyooclumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems nowyoothat it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By thatyoostupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, toyootake the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would haveyoobeen smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...yooI couldn't carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,yoothat's what's the matter! And yet I won't look at it as you do. If I hadyoosucceeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I'm trapped."yooyoo"But that's not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?"yooyoo"Ah, it's not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive! I fail toyoounderstand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.yooThe fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I've never,yoonever recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than everyoofrom seeing that what I did was a crime. I've never, never been strongeryooand more convinced than now."yooyooThe colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he utteredyoohis last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia's eyes and he saw suchyooanguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that heyoohad, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,yoothe cause...yooyoo"Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgivenyooif I am guilty). Good-bye! We won't dispute. It's time, high time to go.yooDon't follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go.... But youyoogo at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! It's my last requestyooof you. Don't leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, thatyooshe is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be withyooher! Razumihin will be with you. I've been talking to him.... Don't cryyooabout me: I'll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am ayoomurderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I won't disgrace you,yooyou will see; I'll still show.... Now good-bye for the present," heyooconcluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia'syooeyes at his last words and promises. "Why are you crying? Don't cry,yoodon't cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I'dyooforgotten!"yooyooHe went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and tookyoofrom between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It wasyoothe portrait of his landlady's daughter, who had died of fever, thatyoostrange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at theyoodelicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gaveyooit to Dounia.yooyoo"I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her," he saidyoothoughtfully. "To her heart I confided much of what has since been soyoohideously realised. Don't be uneasy," he returned to Dounia, "she wasyooas much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The greatyoopoint is that everything now is going to be different, is going toyoobe broken in two," he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection.yoo"Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?yooThey say it is necessary for me to suffer! What's the object of theseyoosenseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when Iyooam crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twentyyooyears' penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am Iyooconsenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stoodyoolooking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!"yooyooAt last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.yooShe walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to lookyooat him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and foryoothe last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,yoohe motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned theyoocorner abruptly.yooyoo"I am wicked, I see that," he thought to himself, feeling ashamed ayoomoment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. "But why are they so fondyooof me if I don't deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one lovedyoome and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would haveyoohappened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow soyoomeek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every wordyoothat I am a criminal? Yes, that's it, that's it, that's what they areyoosending me there for, that's what they want. Look at them running to andyoofro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal atyooheart and, worse still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they'd beyoowild with righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!"yooyooHe fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he couldyoobe humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.yooAnd yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continualyoobondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why shouldyoohe live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would beyooso? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself thatyooquestion since the previous evening, but still he went.yooyooyooyooCHAPTER VIIIyooyooWhen he went into Sonia's room, it was already getting dark. All dayyooSonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had beenyoowaiting with her. She had come to her that morning, rememberingyooSvidrigaïlov's words that Sonia knew. We will not describe theyooconversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.yooDounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that heryoobrother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with hisyooconfession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;yooshe would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,yoobut she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence andyooat first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the pointyooof tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look atyooDounia. Dounia's gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentivelyyooand respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room hadyooremained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.yooyooDounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to heryoobrother's room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would comeyoothere first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dreadyooof his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spentyoothe day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and bothyoowere less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, eachyoothought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said toyooher the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...yooBesides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.yooyoo"Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death toyoomake him live?" she thought at last in despair.yooyooMeanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, lookingyoointently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but theyoounwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began toyoofeel sure of his death--he walked into the room.yooyooShe gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turnedyoopale.yooyoo"Yes," said Raskolnikov, smiling. "I have come for your cross, Sonia. Ityoowas you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightenedyoonow it's come to that?"yooyooSonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a coldyooshiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and theyoowords were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoidyoomeeting her eyes.yooyoo"You see, Sonia, I've decided that it will be better so. There is oneyoofact.... But it's a long story and there's no need to discuss it. Butyoodo you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutishyoofaces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupidyooquestions, which I shall have to answer--they'll point their fingers atyoome.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I'dyoorather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surpriseyoohim, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I've becomeyootoo irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at myyoosister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It'syooa brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are theyoocrosses?"yooyooHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still oryooconcentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop afteryooone another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.yooyooWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypressyoowood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself andyooover him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.yooyoo"It's the symbol of my taking up the cross," he laughed. "As though Iyoohad not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasantyooone; the copper one, that is Lizaveta's--you will wear yourself, showyoome! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things likeyoothese too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the oldyoowoman's neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what Iyooought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting whatyoomatters; I'm somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,yooSonia, so that you might know... that's all--that's all I came for. ButyooI thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now Iyooam going to prison and you'll have your wish. Well, what are you cryingyoofor? You too? Don't. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!"yooyooBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. "Whyyoois she grieving too?" he thought to himself. "What am I to her? Why doesyooshe weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She'llyoobe my nurse."yooyoo"Cross yourself, say at least one prayer," Sonia begged in a timidyoobroken voice.yooyoo"Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely...."yooyooBut he wanted to say something quite different.yooyooHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and putyooit over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of whichyooMarmeladov had spoken, "the family shawl." Raskolnikov thought of thatyoolooking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that heyoowas certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He wasyoofrightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Soniayoomeant to go with him.yooyoo"What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I'll goyooalone," he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he movedyootowards the door. "What's the use of going in procession?" he mutteredyoogoing out.yooyooSonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even saidyoogood-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubtyoosurged in his heart.yooyoo"Was it right, was it right, all this?" he thought again as he went downyoothe stairs. "Couldn't he stop and retract it all... and not go?"yooyooBut still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn't askyoohimself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that heyoohad not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle ofyoothe room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shoutedyooat her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, anotheryoothought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strikeyoohim then.yooyoo"Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--onyoobusiness; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I wasyoo_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her awayyoojust now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I've sunk! No,yooI wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heartyooached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, someyoofriendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of whatyooI would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!"yooyooHe walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. Butyooon reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along ityoowent to the Hay Market.yooyooHe looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object andyoocould not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. "Inyooanother week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over thisyoobridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to rememberyoothis!" slipped into his mind. "Look at this sign! How shall I read thoseyooletters then? It's written here 'Campany,' that's a thing to remember,yoothat letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I lookyooat it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivialyooit all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all beyoointeresting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I amyoobecoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! howyoopeople shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed againstyoome, does he know whom he pushed? There's a peasant woman with a baby,yoobegging. It's curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I mightyoogive her something, for the incongruity of it. Here's a five copeckyoopiece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, myyoogood woman!"yooyoo"God bless you," the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.yooyooHe went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to beyooin a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would haveyoogiven anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that heyoowould not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk andyoodisorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. Thereyoowas a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,yoostared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a shortyoojerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,yoothough he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where heyoowas; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenlyyoocame over him, overwhelming him body and mind.yooyooHe suddenly recalled Sonia's words, "Go to the cross-roads, bow down toyoothe people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and sayyooaloud to the whole world, 'I am a murderer.'" He trembled, rememberingyoothat. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especiallyyooof the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positivelyyooclutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It cameyooover him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul andyoospreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and theyootears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....yooyooHe knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, andyookissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowedyoodown a second time.yooyoo"He's boozed," a youth near him observed.yooyooThere was a roar of laughter.yooyoo"He's going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his childrenyooand his country. He's bowing down to all the world and kissing the greatyoocity of St. Petersburg and its pavement," added a workman who was ayoolittle drunk.yooyoo"Quite a young man, too!" observed a third.yooyoo"And a gentleman," someone observed soberly.yooyoo"There's no knowing who's a gentleman and who isn't nowadays."yooyooThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, "I amyooa murderer," which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,yoodied away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without lookingyooround, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had ayooglimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had feltyoothat it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market heyoosaw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hidingyoofrom him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She hadyoofollowed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment feltyooand knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would followyoohim to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung hisyooheart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.yooyooHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the thirdyoostorey. "I shall be some time going up," he thought. He felt as thoughyoothe fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of timeyooleft for consideration.yooyooAgain the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiralyoostairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens andyoothe same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not beenyoohere since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, butyoostill they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, toyoocollect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. "But why? what for?" heyoowondered, reflecting. "If I must drink the cup what difference does ityoomake? The more revolting the better." He imagined for an instant theyoofigure of the "explosive lieutenant," Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actuallyyoogoing to him? Couldn't he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?yooCouldn't he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch's lodgings?yooAt least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the "explosiveyoolieutenant"! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.yooyooTurning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.yooThere were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and ayoopeasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.yooRaskolnikov walked into the next room. "Perhaps I still need not speak,"yoopassed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform wasyoosettling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk wasyooseating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.yooyoo"No one in?" Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.yooyoo"Whom do you want?"yooyoo"A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent theyooRussian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I've forgotten! 'Atyooyour service!'" a familiar voice cried suddenly.yooyooRaskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. Heyoohad just come in from the third room. "It is the hand of fate," thoughtyooRaskolnikov. "Why is he here?"yooyoo"You've come to see us? What about?" cried Ilya Petrovitch. Heyoowas obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifleyooexhilarated. "If it's on business you are rather early.[*] It's only ayoochance that I am here... however I'll do what I can. I must admit, I...yoowhat is it, what is it? Excuse me...."yooyoo     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is afteryoo     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited theyoo     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached foryoo     coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.yooyoo"Raskolnikov."yooyoo"Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn't imagine I'd forgotten? Don't think Iyooam like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that's it, isn't it?"yooyoo"Rodion Romanovitch."yooyoo"Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. Iyoomade many inquiries about you. I assure you I've been genuinely grievedyoosince that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to meyooafterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... andyooso to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientificyooman does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I haveyoothe greatest respect for literature, in my wife it's a genuine passion!yooLiterature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can beyoogained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat--well,yoowhat does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; butyoowhat's under the hat, what the hat covers, I can't buy that! I was evenyoomeaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you'd... But Iyooam forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear youryoofamily have come?"yooyoo"Yes, my mother and sister."yooyoo"I've even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highlyyoocultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot withyooyou. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your faintingyoofit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!yooI understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging onyooaccount of your family's arriving?"yooyoo"No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should findyooZametov here."yooyoo"Oh, yes! Of course, you've made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov isyoonot here. Yes, we've lost Zametov. He's not been here since yesterday...yoohe quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is ayoofeather-headed youngster, that's all; one might have expected somethingyoofrom him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.yooHe wanted to go in for some examination, but it's only to talk andyooboast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it's a veryyoodifferent matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Youryoocareer is an intellectual one and you won't be deterred by failure. Foryooyou, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are anyooascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learnedyooresearch--that's where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....yooHave you read Livingstone's Travels?"yooyoo"No."yooyoo"Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,yooand indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? Iyooask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer meyooopenly, openly!"yooyoo"N-no..."yooyoo"Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!yooOfficial duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to sayyoo_friendship_ is quite another? No, you're wrong! It's not friendship,yoobut the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and ofyoolove for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always boundyooto feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.yooZametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of badyooreputation, over a glass of champagne... that's all your Zametov is goodyoofor! While I'm perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and loftyyoofeelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married andyoohave children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who isyoohe, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Thenyoothese midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous."yooyooRaskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of IlyayooPetrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part ayoostream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. Heyoolooked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.yooyoo"I mean those crop-headed wenches," the talkative Ilya Petrovitchyoocontinued. "Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactoryyooone, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, amyooI to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!" IlyayooPetrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. "It's an immoderateyoozeal for education, but once you're educated, that's enough. Why abuseyooit? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Whyyoodid he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how commonyoothey are, you can't fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and killyoothemselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heardyooabout a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, whatyoowas the name of that gentleman who shot himself?"yooyoo"Svidrigaïlov," someone answered from the other room with drowsyyoolistlessness.yooyooRaskolnikov started.yooyoo"Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!" he cried.yooyoo"What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?"yooyoo"Yes... I knew him.... He hadn't been here long."yooyoo"Yes, that's so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits andyooall of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He leftyooin his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of hisyoofaculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, theyyoosay. How did you come to know him?"yooyoo"I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family."yooyoo"Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You hadyoono suspicion?"yooyoo"I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing."yooyooRaskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stiflingyoohim.yooyoo"You've turned pale again. It's so stuffy here..."yooyoo"Yes, I must go," muttered Raskolnikov. "Excuse my troubling you...."yooyoo"Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It's a pleasure to see you and Iyooam glad to say so."yooyooIlya Petrovitch held out his hand.yooyoo"I only wanted... I came to see Zametov."yooyoo"I understand, I understand, and it's a pleasure to see you."yooyoo"I... am very glad... good-bye," Raskolnikov smiled.yooyooHe went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not knowyoowhat he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himselfyoowith his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushedyoopast him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog inyoothe lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung ayoorolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.yooThere, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.yooShe looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look ofyoopoignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lipsyooworked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinnedyooand went back to the police office.yooyooIlya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Beforeyoohim stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.yooyoo"Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? What's the matter?"yooyooRaskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.yooHe walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to sayyoosomething, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.yooyoo"You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!"yooyooRaskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on theyooface of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Bothyoolooked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.yooyoo"It was I..." began Raskolnikov.yooyoo"Drink some water."yooyooRaskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,yoobut distinctly said:yooyoo"_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta withyooan axe and robbed them._"yooyooIlya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.yooyooRaskolnikov repeated his statement.yooyooyooyooEPILOGUEyooyooIyooyooSiberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one ofyoothe administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,yooin the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-classyooconvict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost ayooyear and a half has passed since his crime.yooyooThere had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adheredyooexactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse noryoomisrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omityoothe smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, theyoosecret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) whichyoowas found in the murdered woman's hand. He described minutely how heyoohad taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and itsyoocontents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta's murder; described howyooKoch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had saidyooto one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolayyooand Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwardsyoogone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off theyooVoznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.yooThe whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and theyoojudges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that heyoohad hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without makingyoouse of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what theyootrinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he hadyoonever opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemedyooincredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred andyooseventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,yoosome of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from theyoodamp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused manyooshould tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had madeyooa truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyersyoomore versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had reallyyoonot looked into the purse, and so didn't know what was in it when heyoohid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction thatyoothe crime could only have been committed through temporary mentalyooderangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit ofyoogain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporaryyooinsanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. MoreoveryooRaskolnikov's hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, byyooDr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.yooAll this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was notyooquite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was anotheryooelement in the case.yooyooTo the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, theyoocriminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive questionyooas to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, heyooanswered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause wasyoohis miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire toyooprovide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousandyooroubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murderyoothrough his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover byyooprivation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, heyooanswered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almostyoocoarse....yooyooThe sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,yooperhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,yoobut had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strangeyooand peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.yooThere could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken conditionyooof the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what heyoohad stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to hisyooabnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally theyoomurder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a manyoocommits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, theyooconfession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled byyoothe false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,yooand when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, noyoosuspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this didyoomuch to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner'syoofavour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered andyooproved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a pooryooconsumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supportingyoohim for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepityooold father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,yooRaskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeralyoowhen he died. Raskolnikov's landlady bore witness, too, that when theyyoohad lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued twoyoolittle children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This wasyooinvestigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These factsyoomade an impression in his favour.yooyooAnd in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuatingyoocircumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for ayooterm of eight years only.yooyooAt the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov's mother fell ill. Douniayooand Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during theyootrial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, soyooas to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same timeyooto see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna'syooillness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partialyooderangement of her intellect.yooyooWhen Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, sheyoohad found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That eveningyooRazumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother'syooquestions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for heryoomother's benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russiayooon a business commission, which would bring him in the end money andyooreputation.yooyooBut they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna neveryooasked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On theyoocontrary, she had her own version of her son's sudden departure; sheyootold them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hintingyoothat she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodyayoohad many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to beyooin hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would beyoobrilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assuredyooRazumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that hisyooarticle and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she wasyoocontinually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bedyoowith her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject wasyooobviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awakenyooher suspicions.yooyooThey began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna's strangeyoosilence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain ofyoogetting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only livedyooon the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause ofyoogreat uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her motheryoosuspected that there was something terrible in her son's fate and wasyooafraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In anyyoocase, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession ofyooher faculties.yooyooIt happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gaveyoosuch a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer heryoowithout mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory andyoosuspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this moodyoolasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceiveyooher and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutelyyoosilent on certain points; but it became more and more evident thatyoothe poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered heryoobrother's telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in heryoosleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before theyoofatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?yooSometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would beyoosucceeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid wouldyoobegin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of hisyoofuture.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,yoopretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),yoobut she still went on talking.yooyooFive months after Raskolnikov's confession, he was sentenced. Razumihinyooand Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At lastyoothe moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that theyooseparation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, inyoohis youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at leastyooof a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and savingyooup a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in everyyoonatural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. Thereyoothey would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together wouldyoobegin a new life. They all wept at parting.yooyooRaskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a greatyoodeal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worriedyooso much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about hisyoomother's illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularlyyooreserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her byyooSvidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow theyooparty of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a wordyoopassed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew ityoowould be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at hisyoosister's and Razumihin's fervent anticipations of their happy futureyootogether when he should come out of prison. He predicted that theiryoomother's illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at lastyooset off.yooyooTwo months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet andyoosorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.yooDuring all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.yooDounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed sheyoocould not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.yooAmong other things he began attending university lectures again in orderyooto take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;yooboth counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Tillyoothen they rested their hopes on Sonia.yooyooPulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia'syoomarriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even moreyoomelancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her howyooRaskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit fatheryooand how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing twoyoolittle children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited PulcheriayooAlexandrovna's disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She wasyoocontinually talking about them, even entering into conversation withyoostrangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In publicyooconveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she wouldyoobegin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped theyoostudent, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia didyoonot know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbidyooexcitement, there was the risk of someone's recalling Raskolnikov's nameyooand speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out theyooaddress of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insistedyooon going to see her.yooyooAt last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimesyoobegin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. Oneyoomorning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,yoothat she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they mustyooexpect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,yoobegan to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash andyooput up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing andyoohelped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continualyoofancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna wasyootaken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.yooIt was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium sheyoodropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about heryooson's terrible fate than they had supposed.yooyooFor a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother's death, thoughyooa regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reachedyooSiberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every monthyooto the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. Atyoofirst they found Sonia's letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later onyoothey came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, foryoofrom these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunateyoobrother's life. Sonia's letters were full of the most matter-of-factyoodetail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov'syoosurroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, noyooconjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead ofyooany attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave theyoosimple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,yoowhat he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave heryooand so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. Theyoopicture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearnessyooand precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given butyoofacts.yooyooBut Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,yooespecially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and notyooready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gaveyoohim from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother andyoothat when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at lastyooof her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatlyyooaffected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, althoughyoohe seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself offyoofrom everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;yoothat he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,yoohad no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcelyyooseemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything heyoohad known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did hisyoowork without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferentyooabout food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad thatyooat last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to haveyoohis own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,yoodeclaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wroteyoofurther that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that sheyoohad not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they wereyoocrowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with ayoorug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But thatyoohe lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simplyyoofrom inattention and indifference.yooyooSonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,yoohad almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk andyoorude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit andyooalmost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed whenyooshe was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see himyooon holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he wasyoobrought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go toyoosee him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at theyoosheds on the banks of the Irtish.yooyooAbout herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making someyooacquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as thereyoowas scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as anyooindispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that theyooauthorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his taskyoowas lightened and so on.yooyooAt last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm andyoouneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,yoothat his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for daysyooat a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wroteyoothat he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward ofyoothe hospital.yooyooyooyooIIyooyooHe was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life, notyoothe hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothesyoothat crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!yoohe was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could atyooleast reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food toyoohim--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as ayoostudent he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suitedyooto his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamedyooof his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?yooSonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And yet heyoowas ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it withyoohis contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and hisyoofetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It wasyoowounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if heyoocould have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, evenyooshame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely, and his exasperatedyooconscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, exceptyooa simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed justyoobecause he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to griefyoothrough some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit toyoo"the idiocy" of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.yooyooVague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future ayoocontinual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay beforeyoohim. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years heyoowould only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life! What had he toyoolive for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To liveyooin order to exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before toyoogive up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.yooMere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wantedyoomore. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that heyoohad thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.yooyooAnd if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance thatyoowould have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, theyooawful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh, he wouldyoohave been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.yooBut he did not repent of his crime.yooyooAt least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as heyoohad raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.yooBut now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all hisyooactions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesqueyooas they had seemed at the fatal time.yooyoo"In what way," he asked himself, "was my theory stupider than othersyoothat have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One hasyooonly to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluencedyooby commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.yooOh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!yooyoo"Why does my action strike them as so horrible?" he said to himself. "Isyooit because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is atyoorest. Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the lawyoowas broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of theyoolaw... and that's enough. Of course, in that case many of theyoobenefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead ofyooinheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. Butyoothose men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didn't, and so Iyoohad no right to have taken that step."yooyooIt was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the factyoothat he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.yooyooHe suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Whyyoohad he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was theyoodesire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had notyooSvidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?yooyooIn misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,yooat the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he hadyooperhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself andyoohis convictions. He didn't understand that that consciousness might beyoothe promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his futureyooresurrection.yooyooHe preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which heyoocould not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked atyoohis fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life andyooprized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more inyooprison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some ofyoothem, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much foryooa ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden awayyooin some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, andyoolonged to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of theyoogreen grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on heyoosaw still more inexplicable examples.yooyooIn prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did notyoowant to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsomeyooand unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much thatyoosurprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice muchyoothat he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all wasyoothe terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. Theyyooseemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they atyoohim with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of hisyooisolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasonsyoowere so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, politicalyooprisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest asyooignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.yooHe saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than theyooPoles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a formeryooofficer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.yooHe was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him atyoolast--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despisedyooand laughed at his crime.yooyoo"You're a gentleman," they used to say. "You shouldn't hack about withyooan axe; that's not a gentleman's work."yooyooThe second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with hisyoogang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke outyooone day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.yooyoo"You're an infidel! You don't believe in God," they shouted. "You oughtyooto be killed."yooyooHe had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted toyookill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed atyoohim in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;yoohis eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guardyoosucceeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there wouldyoohave been bloodshed.yooyooThere was another question he could not decide: why were they all soyoofond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely metyoothem, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment. And yetyooeverybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,yooknew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them noyooparticular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presentsyooof pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up betweenyoothem and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to theiryoorelations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at theiryooinstructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wivesyooand sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visitedyooRaskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, theyyooall took off their hats to her. "Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, youyooare our dear, good little mother," coarse branded criminals said to thatyoofrail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone wasyoodelighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned roundyooto watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, inyoofact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to heryoofor help in their illnesses.yooyooHe was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. Whenyoohe was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverishyooand delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to ayooterrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths ofyooAsia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sortsyooof microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes wereyooendowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at onceyoomad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectualyooand so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, neveryoohad they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, theiryoomoral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoplesyoowent mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understandyooone another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretchedyoolooking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrungyoohis hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what toyooconsider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whomyooto justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. Theyyoogathered together in armies against one another, but even on the marchyoothe armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be brokenyooand the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, bitingyooand devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long inyoothe towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who wasyoosummoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,yoobecause everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and theyyoocould not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreedyooon something, swore to keep together, but at once began on somethingyooquite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,yoofought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. Allyoomen and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread andyoomoved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the wholeyooworld. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race andyooa new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen theseyoomen, no one had heard their words and their voices.yooyooRaskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory soyoomiserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.yooThe second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright springyoodays; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinelyoopaced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice duringyoohis illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it wasyoodifficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especiallyyooin the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at theyoowindows of the ward.yooyooOne evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. Onyoowaking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in theyoodistance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.yooSomething stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered andyoomoved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the dayyooafter; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he wasyoodischarged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts thatyooSofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.yooyooHe was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt thatyooher illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,yooSonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,yoothat she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come andyoosee him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.yooyooAgain it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o'clock, heyoowent off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabasteryooand where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were onlyyoothree of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to theyoofortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready andyoolaying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the riveryoobank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at theyoowide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened beforeyoohim, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.yooIn the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like blackyoospecks, the nomads' tents. There there was freedom, there other men wereyooliving, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to standyoostill, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.yooRaskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, intoyoocontemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excitedyooand troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come upyoonoiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; theyoomorning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and theyoogreen shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner andyoopaler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her handyoowith her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her handyooto him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he wouldyoorepel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, alwaysyooseemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughoutyooher visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeplyyoogrieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glanceyooat her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They wereyooalone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.yooyooHow it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed toyooseize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms roundyooher knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and sheyooturned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the sameyoomoment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into heryooeyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything andyoothat at last the moment had come....yooyooThey wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. Theyyoowere both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with theyoodawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They wereyoorenewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for theyooheart of the other.yooyooThey resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years toyoowait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness beforeyoothem! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all hisyoobeing, while she--she only lived in his life.yooyooOn the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,yooRaskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fanciedyoothat day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at himyoodifferently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answeredyoohim in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was boundyooto be so. Wasn't everything now bound to be changed?yooyooHe thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented heryooand wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.yooBut these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with whatyooinfinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,yoo_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentenceyooand imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling anyooexternal, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could notyoothink for long together of anything that evening, and he could not haveyooanalysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had steppedyoointo the place of theory and something quite different would work itselfyooout in his mind.yooyooUnder his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.yooThe book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read theyooraising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worryyoohim about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him withyoobooks. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subjectyooand had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for ityoohimself not long before his illness and she brought him the book withoutyooa word. Till now he had not opened it.yooyooHe did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: "Canyooher convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations atyooleast...."yooyooShe too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was takenyooill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she wasyooalmost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! Atyoothe beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both readyyooto look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did notyooknow that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he wouldyoohave to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, greatyoosuffering.yooyooBut that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradualyoorenewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passingyoofrom one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.yooThat might be the subject of a new story, but our present story isyooended.yooyooyooyooyooyooEnd of Project Gutenberg's Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevskyyooyoo*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENT ***yooyoo***** This file should be named 2554-8.txt or 2554-8.zip *****yooThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:yoo        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/5/2554/yooyooProduced by John Bickers; and Dagny and David WidgeryooyooUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionsyoowill be renamed.yooyooCreating the works from public domain print editions means that noyooone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundationyoo(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutyoopermission and without paying copyright royalties.
